This directory contains sample applications that use the API.

encode/
	This directory contains applications for
	encoding/decoding characters and words (either dynamically or using
        a static model), plus it contains the following two applications:

	codelength
	    Prints out the code length (-log probrarbility in bits) of the
            input file with respect to each training model.

	probs
	    Prints out the list of probabilities for the entire
	    alphabet at each stage of the encoding of the input file.
	    Just one model is used.

classify
	This directory contains code for two applications:

	ident_lang & ident_file
	    similar code to the codelength application above
            (in the encode directory), which can be used
	    for identifying languages in text

markup/

        This directory contains various code for "marking up" or
        correcting text.

misc/
	Miscellaneous programs such as loading and writing to a
	table.

stats/
	This directory contains applications for dumping statistics
	about the models.

test/
	Various sample test programs.

train/
        This directory contains programs and their source for building
	("training") static and dynamic models, given some
        "training" text as input.
