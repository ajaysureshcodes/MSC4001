 The aim of this phase is segmenting text Iines of the image into sentences, words and
 characters ( JAINQ 01) . Segmentation is an important step because extraction of
 the characters in this stage directIy affects the accuracy of the recognition process.
 There are two main types of segmentation: EXPLICIT and IMPLICIT.
 The expIicit method is to determine expIicitIy segmentation points in a word by using
 some particuIar points such as spaces or intersection points {BAHLPD 23}. The
 expIicit method anaIyzes the page Iayout into its IogicaI parts in two steps. In the
 impIicit method, segmentation and recognition of characters are managed sequentiaIIy
 {REHMAN 45}. It searches the components of the image which match cIasses in its
 aIphabet. So, aII decisions for segmentation are postponed untiI the recognition phase
 { YSULONG 67 }. There are some probIems in this method. For exampIe, a part ofa
 character can be divided as a segment of another character. In {BRITTOW 89};
 some Ioss in the recognition performance is observed, caused by concurrent
 recognition segmentation. [ jaKaZ]
 NETLOGO : NetLogo is an environment to deveIop agent based modeI simuIations.
 Uri WiIensky authored it in 1999 which was designed in the spirit of the Logo
 programming Ianguage. It consists of a worId and four types of agents which are
 turtIes,patches, Iinks and the observer . WorId is the environment of the turtIes
 ,patches and Iinks, and it can be 2D or 3D. ( FAGSEVX)
