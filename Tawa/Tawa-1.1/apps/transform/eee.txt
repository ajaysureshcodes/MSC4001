Stopping bywoods on a Snowy Evening
by Robert Frost

(sing along to the tune from M.A. S. H)

(this doesn't do so well using just the
bible a straining but it does much better
using the Brown Corpus, for example)

Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village though.
He will not see me stopping here
To watch the woods fill up with snow.

My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near ,
Between the woods and frozen lake,
The darkest evening of the year.

He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake ;
The only other sound's the sweep,
Of easy wind and down yflake.

These woods are lovely dark and deep.
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep;
And miles to go before I sleep.
