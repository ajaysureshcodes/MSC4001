Stopping bywoodsonaSnowy Evening

(sing along to the tune from M. A. S. H) 

 (thisdoes n't do sowellusing just the 
bible as training but it does much better 
using the Brown Corpus, for example)

Whose woods these are I think I know.
H is house is in the village though .
 He will not seemestopping here
To watch the woods fill up with snow.

 My little horse must think itqueer
Tostop without a far m house near, 
Between the woods and frozenlake, 
 The darkest evening of the year.

 He give s his harness bells a shake 
 To ask if there is some mist ake; 
The only other sound 's the sweep,
Of easy wind and down yflake.

 These woods are lovely dark and deep.
 But I have promises to keep, 
Andmiles to go before I sleep; 
Andmiles to go before I sleep.
