Pruning heuristics:

1. Only search if order 1 tag prediction has occured before.
2. Do not predict if tag has occurred very few times and there exist
   cases in the context (either order 0 or order 1) where other
   symbols have occurred frequently:
	freq < 5 and prob < 0.001

	This reduced order 0 context for Suzanne tagset from 392 to 196 

	freq < 3 and totl > 200
