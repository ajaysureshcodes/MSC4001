the
fulton
county
grand
jury
said
friday
an
investigation
of
atlanta
s
recent
primary
election
produced
no
evidence
that
any
irregularities
took
place
the
jury
further
said
in
term
end
presentments
that
the
city
executive
committee
which
had
over
all
charge
of
the
election
deserves
the
praise
and
thanks
of
the
city
of
atlanta
for
the
manner
in
which
the
election
was
conducted
the
september
october
term
jury
had
been
charged
by
fulton
superior
court
judge
durwood
pye
to
investigate
reports
of
possible
irregularities
in
the
hard
fought
primary
which
was
won
by
mayor
nominate
ivan
allen
jr
only
a
relative
handful
of
such
reports
was
received
the
jury
said
considering
the
widespread
interest
in
the
election
the
number
of
voters
and
the
size
of
this
city
the
jury
said
it
did
find
that
many
of
georgia
s
registration
and
election
laws
are
outmoded
or
inadequate
and
often
ambiguous
it
recommended
that
fulton
legislators
act
to
have
these
laws
studied
and
revised
to
the
end
of
modernizing
and
improving
them
the
grand
jury
commented
on
a
number
of
other
topics
among
them
the
atlanta
and
fulton
county
purchasing
departments
which
it
said
are
well
operated
and
follow
generally
accepted
practices
which
inure
to
the
best
interest
of
both
governments
merger
proposed
however
the
jury
said
it
believes
these
two
offices
should
be
combined
to
achieve
greater
efficiency
and
reduce
the
cost
of
administration
the
city
purchasing
department
the
jury
said
is
lacking
in
experienced
clerical
personnel
as
a
result
of
city
personnel
policies
it
urged
that
the
city
take
steps
to
remedy
this
problem
implementation
of
georgia
s
automobile
title
law
was
also
recommended
by
the
outgoing
jury
it
urged
that
the
next
legislature
provide
enabling
funds
and
re
set
the
effective
date
so
that
an
orderly
implementation
of
the
law
may
be
effected
the
grand
jury
took
a
swipe
at
the
state
welfare
department
s
handling
of
federal
funds
granted
for
child
welfare
services
in
foster
homes
this
is
one
of
the
major
items
in
the
fulton
county
general
assistance
program
the
jury
said
but
the
state
welfare
department
has
seen
fit
to
distribute
these
funds
through
the
welfare
departments
of
all
the
counties
in
the
state
with
the
exception
of
fulton
county
which
receives
none
of
this
money
the
jurors
said
they
realize
a
proportionate
distribution
of
these
funds
might
disable
this
program
in
our
less
populous
counties
nevertheless
we
feel
that
in
the
future
fulton
county
should
receive
some
portion
of
these
available
funds
the
jurors
said
failure
to
do
this
will
continue
to
place
a
disproportionate
burden
on
fulton
taxpayers
the
jury
also
commented
on
the
fulton
ordinary
s
court
which
has
been
under
fire
for
its
practices
in
the
appointment
of
appraisers
guardians
and
administrators
and
the
awarding
of
fees
and
compensation
wards
protected
the
jury
said
it
found
the
court
has
incorporated
into
its
operating
procedures
the
recommendations
of
two
previous
grand
juries
the
atlanta
bar
association
and
an
interim
citizens
committee
these
actions
should
serve
to
protect
in
fact
and
in
effect
the
court
s
wards
from
undue
costs
and
its
appointed
and
elected
servants
from
unmeritorious
criticisms
the
jury
said
regarding
atlanta
s
new
multi
million
dollar
airport
the
jury
recommended
that
when
the
new
management
takes
charge
jan
the
airport
be
operated
in
a
manner
that
will
eliminate
political
influences
the
jury
did
not
elaborate
but
it
added
that
there
should
be
periodic
surveillance
of
the
pricing
practices
of
the
concessionaires
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
the
prices
reasonable
ask
jail
deputies
on
other
matters
the
jury
recommended
that
four
additional
deputies
be
employed
at
the
fulton
county
jail
and
a
doctor
medical
intern
or
extern
be
employed
for
night
and
weekend
duty
at
the
jail
fulton
legislators
work
with
city
officials
to
pass
enabling
legislation
that
will

the
establishment
of

georgia
republicans
are
getting
strong
encouragement
to
enter
a
candidate
in
the
governor
s
race
a
top
official
said
wednesday
robert
snodgrass
state
gop
chairman
said
a
meeting
held
tuesday
night
in
blue
ridge
brought
enthusiastic
responses
from
the
audience
state
party
chairman
james
w
dorsey
added
that
enthusiasm
was
picking
up
for
a
state
rally
to
be
held
sept
in
savannah
at
which
newly
elected
texas
sen
john
tower
will
be
the
featured
speaker
in
the
blue
ridge
meeting
the
audience
was
warned
that
entering
a
candidate
for
governor
would
force
it
to
take
petitions
out
into
voting
precincts
to
obtain
the
signatures
of
registered
voters
despite
the
warning
there
was
a
unanimous
vote
to
enter
a
candidate
according
to
republicans
who
attended
when
the
crowd
was
asked
whether
it
wanted
to
wait
one
more
term
to
make
the
race
it
voted
no
and
there
were
no
dissents
the
largest
hurdle
the
republicans
would
have
to
face
is
a
state
law
which
says
that
before
making
a
first
race
one
of
two
alternative
courses
must
be
taken
five
per
cent
of
the
voters
in
each
county
must
sign
petitions
requesting
that
the
republicans
be
allowed
to
place
names
of
candidates
on
the
general
election
ballot
or
the
republicans
must
hold
a
primary
under

approved
earlier
in

meanwhile
it
was
learned
the
state
highway
department
is
very
near
being
ready
to
issue
the
first
million
worth
of
highway
reconstruction
bonds
the
bond
issue
will
go
to

worth
of

work
a
revolving

the
department
apparently
intends
to
make
the
rural

authority
a
revolving
fund
under
which
new
bonds
would
be
issued
every
time
a
portion
of

are
paid
off

proposed
by

gov
marvin

the

source
told

however
that

said
sunday
night
there
was
research
being
done
on
whether
the
quickie

on

can
be
repealed
outright

whether

would
be
sought
while
emphasizing
that
technical
details
were
not
fully
worked

said
his

would
seek
to
set

said
there
are
some
members
of
our
congressional
delegation
in
washington
who
would
like
to
see
it
the

passed
but
he
added
that
none

specifically
asked

tossed
into
the

austin

daniel
s

property
act
seemed
certain
thursday
despite
the
adamant
protests
of
texas
bankers
daniel
personally
led
the
fight
for
the
measure
which
he
had
watered
down
considerably
since
its
rejection
by
two
previous
legislatures
in
a
public
hearing
before
the
house
committee
on
revenue
and
taxation
under
committee
rules
it
went
automatically
to
a
subcommittee
for
one
week
but
questions
with
which
committee
members
taunted
bankers
appearing
as
witnesses
left
little
doubt
that
they
will
recommend
passage
of
it
daniel
termed
extremely
conservative
his
estimate
that
it
would
produce
million
dollars
to
help
erase
an
anticipated
deficit
of
million
dollars
at
the
end
of
the
current
fiscal
year
next
aug
he
told
the
committee
the
measure
would
merely
provide
means
of
enforcing
the
escheat
law
which
has
been
on
the
books
since
texas
was
a
republic
it
permits
the
state
to
take
over
bank
accounts
stocks
and
other
personal
property
of
persons
missing
for
seven
years
or
more
the
bill
which
daniel
said
he
drafted
personally
would
force
banks
insurance
firms
pipeline
companies
and
other
corporations
to
report
such
property
to
the
state
treasurer
the
escheat
law
can
not
be
enforced
now
because
it
is
almost
impossible
to
locate
such
property
daniel
declared
dewey
lawrence
a
tyler
lawyer
representing
the
texas
bankers
association
sounded
the
opposition
keynote
when
he
said
it
would
force
banks
to
violate
their
contractual
obligations
with
depositors
and
undermine
the
confidence
of
bank
customers
if
you
destroy
confidence
in
banks
you
do
something
to
the
economy
he
said
you
take
out
of
circulation
many
millions
of
dollars
rep
charles
e
hughes
of
sherman
sponsor
of
the
bill
said
a
failure
to
enact
it
would
amount
to
making
a
gift
out
of
the
taxpayers
pockets
to
banks
insurance
and

companies

gaynor
b
jones
of
houston
j

brady
of
harlingen
and
howard
cox
of

cox
argued
that
the
bill
is
probably
unconstitutional
since
he
said
it
would
impair
contracts
he
also
complained
that
not
enough
notice
was
given
on
the
hearing

there

thursday
rep
james
cotten
of
weatherford
insisted
that
a
water
development
bill
passed
by
the
texas

of

was
an
effort
by
big
cities
like
dallas
and
fort

to
cover
up
places
like
paradise
a
wise
county
hamlet
of

when

ended

passed
to
sending
it
to
the

where
a
similar
proposal
is
being
sponsored
by
sen
george
parkhouse
of
dallas
most
of
the
fire
was
directed
by
cotten
against
dallas
and
sen
parkhouse
the
bill
would
increase
from
to
the
maximum
loan
the
state
could
make
to
a
local
water
project
cotten
construed
this
as
a
veiled
effort
by
parkhouse
to
help
dallas
and
other
large
cities
get
money
which
cotten
felt
could
better
be
spent
providing
water
for
rural
texas
statements
by
other
legislators
that
dallas
is
paying
for
all
its

program
by

and
that

would
benefit
most

the

may
be
highly

told

some
of

strongly

were
doing

charged
that

obtained
evidence
by
unfair
and
fundamentally
illegal
means
karns
said
that
the

involved
a
matter
of
even
greater
significance
than
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
persons
he
said
evidence
was
obtained
in

of
the
legal

this

constituted

wexler
has
denied
repeatedly
that

was
used
in

karns
said
it
was
a
wrongful
act
for
wexler
to
take
statements
privately
and
outside
of
the
grand
jury
room
he
said
this
constituted
a
very
serious
misuse
of
the
criminal
court
processes
actually
the
abuse
of
the
process
may
have
constituted
a
contempt
of

with

miscount
of

in

washington
feb
president
kennedy
today
proposed
a
mammoth
new
medical
care
program
whereby
social
security
taxes
on
million
american
workers
would
be
raised
to
pay
the
hospital
and
some
other
medical
bills
of
million
americans
over
who
are
covered
by
social
security
or
railroad
retirement
programs
the
president
in
a
special
message
to
congress
tied
in
with
his
aged
care
plan
requests
for
large
federal
grants
to
finance
medical
and
dental
scholarships
build
new
medical
and
new
dental
schools
and
expand
child
health
care
and
general
medical
research
the
aged
care
plan
similar
to
one
the
president
sponsored
last
year
as
a
senator
a
fight
on
capitol
hill
it
was
defeated
in
congress
last
year
cost
up
to
a
year
it
would
be
financed
by
boosting
the
social
security
payroll
tax
by
as
much
as
a
year
for
each
of
the
workers
now
paying
such
taxes
the
social
security
payroll
tax
is
now
per
cent
per
cent
on
each
worker
and
employer
on
the
first
of
pay
per
year
the
kennedy
plan
alone
would
boost
the
base
to
a
year
and
the
payroll
tax
to
per
cent
per
cent
each
similar
payroll
tax
boosts
would
be
imposed
on
those
under
the
railroad
retirement
system
the
payroll
tax
would
actually
rise
to
per
cent
starting
jan
if
the
plan
is
approved
because
the
levy
is
already
scheduled
to
go
up
by
per
cent
on
that
date
to
pay
for
other
social
security
costs
outlays
would
increase
officials
estimated
the
annual
tax
boost
for
the
medical
plan
would
amount
to
billion
dollars
and
that
medical
benefits
paid
out
would
run
billion
or
more
in
the
first
year
both
figures
would
go
higher
in
later
years
other
parts
of
the
kennedy
health
plan
would
entail
federal
grants
of
million
to
billion
dollars
over
the
next
years
these
would
be
paid
for
out
of
general
not
payroll
taxes

that
the

would

of

bills
for
up

a

could
receive
up

paid
for

the
president
noted
that
congress
last
year
passed
a
law
providing
grants
to
states
to
help
pay
medical
bills
of
the
needy
aged
calls
proposal
modest
he
said
his
plan
is
designed
to
meet
the
needs
of
those
millions
who
have
no
wish
to
receive
care
at
the
taxpayers
expense
but
who
are
nevertheless
staggered
by
the
drain
on
their
savings
or
those
of
their
children
caused
by
an
extended
hospital
stay
this
is
a
very
modest
proposal
cut
to
meet
absolutely
essential
needs
he
said
and
with
sufficient
deductible
requirements
to
discourage
any
malingering
or
unnecessary
overcrowding
of
our
hospitals
this
is
not
a
program
of
socialized
medicine
it
is
a
program
of
prepayment
of
health
costs
with
absolute
freedom
of
choice
guaranteed
every
person
will
choose
his
own
doctor
and
hospital
would
n
t
pay
doctors
the
plan
does
not
cover
doctor
bills
they
would
still
be
paid
by
the
patient
apart
from
the
aged
care
plan
the
president
s
most
ambitious
and
costly
proposals

the

the

medical

dental
schools
can
not
now
handle
the
student
load
needed
to
meet
the
rising
need
for
health
care
moreover
he
said
many
qualified
young
people
are
not
going
into
medicine
and
dentistry
because
they
ca
n
t
afford
the
schooling
costs
contributions
to
schools
the
scholarship
plan
would
provide
federal
contributions
to
each
medical
and
dental
school
equal
to
a
year
for
one
fourth
of
the
first
year
students
the
schools
could
use
the
money
to
pay
year
scholarships
based
on
need
of
up
to
a

per
student
in
addition
the
government
would
pay
a
cost
of
education
grant
to
the

for
each

officials
estimated
the
combined
programs
would
cost
million
dollars
the
first
year
and
would
go
up
to
millions
by
the
president
recommended
federal
matching
grants
totaling
million
dollars
in
years
for
constructing
new
medical
and
dental
schools
or
enlarging
the
capacity
of
existing
ones
more
for
nursing
homes
in
the
area
of
community

services
the
president
called
for
doubling
the
present
million
dollar
a
year
federal
grants
for
nursing
home
construction
he
asked
for
another
million
dollar
initial
appropriation
for
stimulatory
grants
to
states
to
improve
nursing
homes
he
further
proposed
grants
of
an
unspecified
sum
for
experimental
hospitals
in
the
child
health
field
the
president
said
he
will
recommend
later
an
increase
in
funds
for
programs
under
the
children
s
bureau
he
also
asked
congress
to
approve
establishment
of
a

the
president
said
he
will
ask
congress
to
increase

to
states
for
vocational
rehabilitation
he
did
not
say
by
how
much
for

he
asked
a

a
year
increase
from
to
millions

the

he
will
also

along

legislators
who
last

opposed

hailed
the
message
senate

the

in

all

in
connection
with

eisenhower
s
cabinet
selections
in
and
president
kennedy
s
in
oslo
the
most
positive
element
to
emerge
from
the
oslo
meeting
of
north
atlantic
treaty
organization
foreign
ministers
has
been
the
freer
franker
and
wider
discussions
animated
by
much
better
mutual
understanding
than
in
past
meetings
this
has
been
a
working
session
of
an
organization
that
by
its
very
nature
can
only
proceed
along
its
route
step
by
step
and
without
dramatic
changes
in
oslo
the
ministers
have
met
in
a
climate
of
candor
and
made
a
genuine
attempt
to
get
information
and
understanding
one
another
s
problems
this
atmosphere
of
understanding
has
been
particularly
noticeable
where
relations
are
concerned
between
the
colonialist
powers
and
those
who
have
never
or
not
for
a
long
time
had
such
problems
the
nightmare
of
a
clash
between
those
in
trouble
in
africa
exacerbated
by
the
difficulties
changes
and
tragedies
facing
them
and
other
allies
who
intellectually
and
emotionally
disapprove
of
the
circumstances
that
have
brought
these
troubles
about
has
been
conspicious
by
its
absence
explosion
avoided
in
the
case
of
portugal
which
a
few
weeks
ago
was
rumored
ready
to
walk
out
of
the
nato
council
should
critics
of
its
angola
policy
prove
harsh
there
has
been
a
noticeable
relaxation
of
tension
the
general
remarkably
courteous
explanation
has
left
basic
positions
unchanged
but
there
has
been
no
explosion
in
the
council
there
should
even
be
no
more
bitter
surprises
in
the
un
general
assembly
as
to
nato
members
votes
since
a
new
ad
hoc
nato
committee
has
been
set
up
so
that
in
the
future
such
topics
as
angola
will
be
discussed
in
advance
canada
alone
has
been
somewhat
out
of
step
with
the
oslo
attempt
to
get
all
the
allied
cars
back
on
the
track
behind
the
nato
locomotive
even
norway
despite
daily
but
limited
manifestations
against
atomic
arms
in
the
heart
of
this
northernmost
capital
of
the
alliance
is
today
closer
to
the
nato
line
on
the
negative
side
of
the
balance
sheet
must
be
set
some
disappointment
that
the
united
states
leadership
has
not
been
as
much
in
evidence
as
hoped
for
one
diplomat
described
the
tenor
of
secretary
of
state
dean
rusk
s
speeches
as
inconclusive
but
he
hastened
to
add
that
if
united
states
policies
were
not
always
clear
despite
mr
rusk
s
analysis
of
the
various
global
danger
points
and
setbacks
for
the
west
this
may
merely
mean
the
new
administration
has
not
yet
firmly
fixed
its
policy
exploratory
mood
a
certain
vagueness
may
also
be
caused
by
tactical
appreciation
of
the
fact
that
the
present
council
meeting
is
a
semipublic
affair
with
no
fewer
than
six
soviet
correspondents
accredited
the
impression
has
nevertheless
been
given
during
these
three
days
despite
mr
rusk
s
personal
popularity
that
the
united
states
delegation
came
to
oslo
in
a
somewhat
tentative
and
exploratory
frame
of
mind
more
ready
to
listen
and
learn
than
to
enunciate
firm
policy
on
a
global
scale
with
detailed
application
to
individual
danger
spots
the
secretary
of
state
himself
in
his
first
speech
gave
some
idea
of
the
tremendous
march
of
events
inside
and
outside
the
united
states
that
has
preoccupied
the
new
administration
in
the
past
four
months
but
where
the
core
of
nato
is
concerned
the
secretary
of
state
has
not
only
reiterated
the
united
states
profound
attachment
to
the
alliance
cornerstone
of
its
foreign
policy
but
has
announced
that
five
nuclear
submarines
will
eventually
be
at
nato
s
disposal
in
european
waters
the
secretary
of
state
has
also
solemnly
repeated
a
warning
to
the
soviet
union
that
the
united
states
will
not
stand
for
another
setback
in
berlin
an
affirmation
once
again
taken
up
by
the
council
as
a
whole
conflict
surveyed
the
secretary
s
greatest
achievement
is
perhaps
the
rekindling
of
nato
realization
that
east
west
friction
wherever
it
take
place
around
the
globe
is
in
essence
the
general
conflict
between
two
entirely
different
societies
and
must
be
treated
as
such
without
regard
to
geographical
distance
or
lack
of
apparent
connection
the
annual
spring
meeting
has
given
an
impetus
in
three
main
directions
more
deeper
and
more
timely
political
consultation
within
the
alliance
the
use
of
the
organization
for
economic
cooperation
and
development
when
ratified
as
a
method
of
coordinating
aid
to
the
underdeveloped
countries
and
the
need
for
strengthening
conventional
forces
as
well
as
the
maintenance
of
the
nuclear
deterrent
this
increase
in
the
threshold
as
the
conventional
forces
strengthening
is
called
will
prove
one
of
the
alliance
s
most
difficult
problems
in
the
months
to
come
each
ally
will
have
to
carry
out
obligations
long
since
laid
down
but
never
completely
fulfilled
washington
the
kennedy
administration
moves
haltingly
toward
a
geneva
conference
on
laos
just
as
serious
debate
over
its
foreign
policy
erupts
for
the
first
time
there
is
little
optimism
here
that
the
communists
will
be
any
more
docile
at
the
conference
table
than
they
were
in
military
actions
on
the
ground
in
laos
the
united
states
state
department
officials
explain
now
is
mainly
interested
in
setting
up
an
international
inspection
system
which
will
prevent
laos
from
being
used
as
a
base
for
communist
attacks
on
neighboring
thailand
and
south
viet
nam
they
count
on
the
aid
of
the
neutral
countries
attending
the
geneva
conference
to
achieve
this
the
united
states
hopes
that
any
future
lao
cabinet
would
not
become
communist
dominated
but
it
is
apparent
that
no
acceptable
formula
has
been
found
to
prevent
such
a
possibility
policies
modified
the
inclination
here
is
to
accept
a
de
facto
cease
fire
in
laos
rather
than
continue
to
insist
on
a
verification
of
the
cease
fire
by
the
international
control
commission
before
participating
in
the
geneva
conference
this
is
another
of
the
modifications
of
policy
on
laos
that
the
kennedy
administration
has
felt
compelled
to
make
it
excuses
these
actions
as
being
the
chain
reaction
to
basic
errors
made
in
the
previous
administration
its
spokesmen
insist
that
there
has
not
been
time
enough
to
institute
reforms
in
military
and
economic
aid
policies
in
the
critical
areas
but
with
the
months
moving
on
and
the
immediate
confrontations
with
the
communists
showing
no
gain
for
the
free
world
the
question
arises
how
effective
have
kennedy
administration
first
foreign
policy
decisions
been
in
dealing
with
communist
aggression
former
vice
president
richard
m
nixon
in
detroit
called
for
a
firmer
and
tougher
policy
toward
the
soviet
union
he
was
critical
of
what
he
feels
is
president
kennedy
s
tendency
to
be
too
conciliatory
gop
restrained
it
does
not
take
a
gallup
poll
to
find
out
that
most
republicans
in
congress
feel
this
understates
the
situation
as
republicans
see
it
they
can
hardly
restrain
themselves
from
raising
the
question
of
whether
republicans
if
they
had
been
in
power
would
have
made
amateurish
and
monumental
blunders
in
cuba
one
republican
senator
told
this
correspondent
that
he
was
constantly
being
asked
why
he
did
n
t
attack
the
kennedy
administration
on
this
score
his
reply
he
said
was
that
he
agreed
to
the
need
for
unity
in
the
country
now
but
he
further
said
that
it
was
better
politics
to
let
others
question
the
wisdom
of
administration
policies
first
the
republicans
some
weeks
ago
served
notice
through
senator
thruston
b
morton
r
of
kentucky
chairman
of
the
republican
national
committee
that
the
kennedy
administration
would
be
held
responsible
if
the
outcome
in
laos
was
a
coalition
government
susceptible
of
communist
domination
kennedy
administration
policies
also
have
been
assailed
now
from
another
direction
by
harvard
boston
university
brandeis
and
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
educators
detente
urged
this
group
pleads
with
the
administration
to
give
no
further
support
for
the
invasion
of
cuba
by
exile
groups
it
recommends
that
the
united
states
seek
instead
to
detach
the
castro
regime
from
the
communist
bloc
by
working
for
a
diplomatic
detente
and
a
resumption
of
trade
relations
and
concentrate
its
constructive
efforts
on
eliminating
in
other
parts
of
latin
america
the
social
conditions
on
which
totalitarian
nationalism
feeds
mr
nixon
for
his
part
would
oppose
intervention
in
cuba
without
specific
provocation
but
he
did
recommend
that
president
kennedy
state
clearly
that
if
communist
countries
shipped
any
further
arms
to
cuba
that
it
would
not
be
tolerated
until
the
cuban
fiasco
and
the
communist
military
victories
in
laos
almost
any
observer
would
have
said
that
president
kennedy
had
blended
a
program
that
respected
generally
the
opinions
voiced
both
by
mr
nixon
and
the
professors
aid
plans
revamped
very
early
in
his
administration
he
informed
the
kremlin
through
diplomatic
channels
a
high
official
source
disclosed
that
the
new
administration
would
react
even
tougher
than
the
eisenhower
administration
would
during
the
formative
period
of
the
administration
strenuous
efforts
were
made
to
remove
pin
pricking
from
administration
statements
policies
on
nuclear
test
ban
negotiations
were
reviewed
and
changed
but
thus
far
there
has
been
no
response
in
kind
foreign
aid
programs
were
revamped
to
give
greater
emphasis
to
economic
aid
and
to
encourage
political
reform
in
recipient
nations
in
laos
the
administration
looked
at
the
eisenhower
administration
efforts
to
show
determination
by
sailing
a
naval
fleet
into
southeast
asian
waters
as
a
useless
gesture
again
and
again
it
asked
the
communists
to
freeze
the
military
situation
in
laos
but
the
communists
aided
the
pathet
lao
at
an
even
faster
rate
and
after
several
correspondents
went
into
pathet
lao
territory
and
exposed
the
huge
build
up
administration
spokesmen
acclaimed
them
for
performing
a
great
service
and
laid
the
matter
before
the
southeast
asia
treaty
organization
seato
was
steamed
up
and
prepared
contingency
plans
for
coping
with
the
military
losses
in
laos
but
the
communists
never
gave
sufficient
provocation
at
any
one
time
for
the
united
states
to
want
to
risk
a
limited
or
an
all
out
war
over
laos
some
seato
nations
disagreed
however
there
was
the
further
complication
that
the
administration
had
very
early
concluded
that
laos
was
ill
suited
to
be
an
ally
unlike
its
more
determined
neighbors
thailand
and
south
viet
nam
the
administration
declared
itself
in
favor
of
a
neutralized
laos
the
pro
western
government
which
the
united
states
had
helped
in
a
revolt
against
the
souvanna
phouma
neutralist
government
never
did
appear
to
spark
much
fighting
spirit
in
the
royal
lao
army
there
certainly
was
not
any
more
energy
displayed
after
it
was
clear
the
united
states
would
not
back
the
pro
western
government
to
the
hilt
if
the
administration
ever
had
any
ideas
that
it
could
find
an
acceptable
alternative
to
prince
souvanna
phouma
whom
it
felt
was
too
trusting
of
communists
it
gradually
had
to
relinquish
them
one
factor
was
the
statement
of
senator
j
w
fulbright
d
of
arkansas
chairman
of
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee
he
declared
on
march
that
the
united
states
had
erred
a
year
and
a
half
ago
by
encouraging
the
removal
of
prince
souvanna
washington
the
white
house
is
taking
extraordinary
steps
to
check
the
rapid
growth
of
juvenile
delinquency
in
the
united
states
the
president
is
deeply
concerned
over
this
problem
and
its
effect
upon
the
vitality
of
the
nation
in
an
important
assertion
of
national
leadership
in
this
field
he
has
issued
an
executive
order
establishing
the
president
s
committee
on
juvenile
delinquency
and
crime
to
be
supported
and
assisted
by
a
citizens
advisory
council
of
recognized
authorities
on
juvenile
problems
the
president
asks
the
support
and
cooperation
of
congress
in
his
efforts
through
the
enactment
of
legislation
to
provide
federal
grants
to
states
for
specified
efforts
in
combating
this
disturbing
crime
trend
offenses
multiply
the
president
has
also
called
upon
the
attorney
general
the
secretary
of
health
education
and
welfare
and
the
secretary
of
labor
to
coordinate
their
efforts
in
the
development
of
a
program
of
federal
leadership
to
assist
states
and
local
communities
in
their
efforts
to
cope
with
the
problem
simultaneously
the
president
announced
thursday
the
appointment
of
david
l
hackett
a
special
assistant
ot
the
attorney
general
as
executive
director
of
the
new
committee
on
juvenile
delinquency
and
youth
crime
his
sense
of
urgency
in
this
matter
stems
from
the
fact
that
court
cases
ond
juvenile
arrests
have
more
than
doubled
since
each
year
showing
an
increase
in
offenders
among
arrests
reported
by
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
in
about
half
for
burglary
and
larceny
involved
persons
under
years
of
age
east
providence
should
organize
its
civil
defense
setup
and
begin
by
appointing
a
full
time
director
raymond
h
hawksley
the
present
city
cd
head
believes
mr
hawksley
said
yesterday
he
would
be
willing
to
go
before
the
city
council
or
anyone
else
locally
to
outline
his
proposal
at
the
earliest
possible
time
east
providence
now
has
no
civil
defense
program
mr
hawksley
the
state
s
general
treasurer
has
been
a
part
time
cd
director
in
the
city
for
the
last
nine
years
he
is
not
interested
in
being
named
a
full
time
director
noting
that
president
kennedy
has
handed
the
defense
department
the
major
responsibility
for
the
nation
s
civil
defense
program
mr
hawksley
said
the
federal
government
would
pay
half
the
salary
of
a
full
time
local
director
he
expressed
the
opinion
the
city
could
hire
a
cd
director
for
about
a
year
and
would
only
have
to
put
up
half
that
amount
on
a
matching
fund
basis
to
defray
the
salary
costs
mr
hawksley
said
he
believed
there
are
a
number
of
qualified
city
residents
who
would
be
willing
to
take
the
full
time
cd
job
one
of
these
men
is
former
fire
chief
john
a
laughlin
he
said
along
with
a
director
the
city
should
provide
a
cd
headquarters
so
that
pertinent
information
about
the
local
organization
would
be
centralized
mr
hawksley
said
one
advantage
that
would
come
to
the
city
in
having
a
full
time
director
he
said
is
that
east
providence
would
become
eligible
to
apply
to
the
federal
government
for
financial
aid
in
purchasing
equipment
needed
for
a
sound
civil
defense
program
matching
funds
also
can
be
obtained
for
procurement
of
such
items
as
radios
sirens
and
rescue
trucks
he
said
mr
hawksley
believes
that
east
providence
could
use
two
more
rescue
trucks
similar
to
the
cd
vehicle
obtained
several
years
ago
and
now
detailed
to
the
central
fire
station
he
would
assign
one
of
the
rescue
trucks
to
the
riverside
section
of
the
city
and
the
other
to
the
rumford
area
speaking
of
the
present
status
of
civil
defense
in
the
city
mr
hawksley
said
he
would
be
willing
to
bet
that
not
more
than
one
person
in
a
hundred
would
know
what
to
do
or
where
to
go
in
the
event
of
an
enemy
attack
the
narragansett
race
track
grounds
is
one
assembly
point
he
said
and
a
drive
in
theater
in
seekonk
would
be
another
riverside
residents
would
go
to
the
seekonk
assembly
point
mr
hawksley
said
he
was
not
critical
of
city
residents
for
not
knowing
what
to
do
or
where
to
assemble
in
case
of
an
air
attack
such
vital
information
he
said
has
to
be
made
available
to
the
public
frequently
and
at
regular
intervals
for
residents
to
know
if
the
city
council
fails
to
consider
appointment
of
a
full
time
cd
director
mr
hawksley
said
then
he
plans
to
call
a
meeting
early
in
september
so
that
a
civil
defense
organization
will
be
developed
locally
one
of
the
first
things
he
would
do
he
said
would
be
to
organize
classes
in
first
aid
other
steps
would
be
developed
after
information
drifts
down
to
the
local
level
from
the
federal
government
rhode
island
is
going
to
examine
its
sunday
sales
law
with
possible
revisions
in
mind
governor
notte
said
last
night
he
plans
to
name
a
committee
to
make
the
study
and
come
up
with
recommendations
for
possible
changes
in
time
for
the
next
session
of
the
general
assembly
the
governor
s
move
into
the
so
called
blue
law
controversy
came
in
the
form
of
a
letter
to
miss
mary
r
grant
deputy
city
clerk
of
central
falls
a
copy
was
released
to
the
press
mr
notte
was
responding
to
a
resolution
adopted
by
the
central
falls
city
council
on
july
and
sent
to
the
state
house
by
miss
grant
the
resolution
urges
the
governor
to
have
a
complete
study
of
the
sunday
sales
laws
made
with
an
eye
to
their
revision
at
the
next
session
of
the
legislature
while
the
city
council
suggested
that
the
legislative
council
might
perform
the
review
mr
notte
said
that
instead
he
will
take
up
the
matter
with
atty
gen
j
joseph
nugent
to
get
the
benefit
of
his
views
he
will
then
appoint
the
study
committee
with
mr
nugent
s
cooperation
the
governor
said
i
would
expect
the
proposed
committee
to
hold
public
hearings
mr
notte
said
to
obtain
the
views
of
the
general
public
and
religious
labor
and
special
interest
groups
affected
by
these
laws
the
governor
wrote
miss
grant
that
he
has
been
concerned
for
some
time
with
the
continuous
problem
which
confronts
our
local
and
state
law
enforcement
officers
as
a
result
of
the
laws
regulating
sunday
sales
the
attorney
general
has
advised
local
police
that
it
is
their
duty
to
enforce
the
blue
laws
should
there
be
evidence
they
are
shirking
he
has
said
the
state
police
will
step
into
the
situation
there
has
been
more
activity
across
the
state
line
in
massachusetts
than
in
rhode
island
in
recent
weeks
toward
enforcement
of
the
sunday
sales
laws
the
statutes
similar
in
both
the
bay
state
and
rhode
island
and
dating
back
in
some
instances
to
colonial
times
severely
limit
the
types
of
merchandise
that
may
be
sold
on
the
sabbath
the
central
falls
city
council
expressed
concern
especially
that
more
foods
be
placed
on
the
eligible
list
and
that
neighborhood
grocery
and
variety
stores
be
allowed
to
do
business
on
sunday
the
only
day
they
have
a
chance
to
compete
with
large
supermarkets
is
on
sunday
the
council
s
resolution
said
the
small
shops
must
be
retained
for
they
provide
essential
service
to
the
community
according
to
the
resolution
which
added
that
they
also
are
the
source
of
livelihood
for
thousands
of
our
neighbors
it
declares
that
sunday
sales
licenses
provide
great
revenue
to
the
local
government
the
council
advised
the
governor
that
large
supermarkets
factory
outlets
and
department
stores
not
be
allowed
to
do
business
on
sunday
they
operate
on
a
volume
basis
it
was
contended
and
are
not
essential
to
provide
the
more
limited
but
vital
shopping
needs
of
the
community
liberals
and
conservatives
in
both
parties
democratic
and
republican
should
divorce
themselves
and
form
two
independent
parties
george
h
reama
nationally
known
labor
management
expert
said
here
yesterday
mr
reama
told
the
rotary
club
of
providence
at
its
luncheon
at
the
sheraton
biltmore
hotel
that
about
half
of
the
people
in
the
country
want
the
welfare
type
of
government
and
the
other
half
want
a
free
enterprise
system
he
suggested
that
a
regrouping
of
forces
might
allow
the
average
voter
a
better
pull
at
the
right
lever
for
him
on
election
day
he
said
he
was
confessing
that
i
was
a
member
of
the
socialist
party
in
that
he
added
was
when
he
was
a
very
young
man
a
machinist
and
toolmaker
by
trade
that
was
before
i
studied
law
some
of
my
fellow
workers
were
grooming
me
for
an
office
in
the
socialist
party
the
lawyer
with
whom
i
studied
law
steered
me
off
the
socialist
track
he
steered
me
to
the
right
track
the
free
enterprise
track
he
said
that
when
he
was
a
socialist
in
the
party
called
for
government
operation
of
all
utilities
and
the
pooling
of
all
resources
he
suggested
that
without
the
socialist
party
ever
gaining
a
national
victory
most
of
its
original
program
has
come
to
pass
under
both
major
parties
mr
reama
who
retired
as
vice
president
of
the
american
screw
co
in
said
both
parties
in
the
last
election
told
us
that
we
need
a
five
per
cent
growth
in
the
gross
national
product
but
neither
told
us
how
to
achieve
it
he
said
he
favors
wage
increases
for
workers
but
manufacturers
are
caught
in
a
profit
squeeze
and
raises
should
only
come
when
the
public
is
conditioned
to
higher
prices
he
added
indicating
the
way
in
which
he
has
turned
his
back
on
his
philosophy
mr
reama
said
a
socialist
is
a
person
who
believes
in
dividing
everything
he
does
not
own
mr
reama
far
from
really
being
retired
is
engaged
in
industrial
relations
counseling
a
petition
bearing
the
signatures
of
more
than
johnston
taxpayers
was
presented
to
the
town
council
last
night
as
what
is
hoped
will
be
the
first
step
in
obtaining
a
home
rule
charter
for
the
town
william
a
martinelli
chairman
of
the
citizens
group
of
johnston
transferred
the
petitions
from
his
left
hand
to
his
right
hand
after
the
council
voted
to
accept
them
at
the
suggestion
of
council
president
raymond
fortin
sr
the
law
which
governs
home
rule
charter
petitions
states
that
they
must
be
referred
to
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
canvassers
for
verification
of
the
signatures
within
days
and
mr
martinelli
happens
to
hold
that
post
mr
martinelli
explained
that
there
should
be
more
than
enough
signatures
to
assure
the
scheduling
of
a
vote
on
the
home
rule
charter
and
possible
election
of
a
nine
member
charter
commission
within
days
he
explained
that
by
law
the
council
must
establish
procedures
for
a
vote
on
the
issue
within
days
after
the
board
of
canvassers
completes
its
work
a
difference
of
opinion
arose
between
mr
martinelli
and
john
p
bourcier
town
solicitor
over
the
exact
manner
in
which
the
vote
is
handled
mr
martinelli
has
in
recent
weeks
been
of
the
opinion
that
a
special
town
meeting
would
be
called
for
the
vote
while
mr
bourcier
said
that
a
special
election
might
be
called
instead
mr
bourcier
said
that
he
had
consulted
several
superior
court
justices
in
the
last
week
and
received
opinions
favoring
both
procedures
he
assured
mr
martinelli
and
the
council
that
he
would
study
the
correct
method
and
report
back
to
the
council
as
soon
as
possible
mr
martinelli
said
yesterday
that
the
citizens
group
of
johnston
will
meet
again
july
to
plan
further
strategy
in
the
charter
movement
he
said
that
the
group
has
no
candidates
for
the
charter
commission
in
mind
at
present
but
that
it
will
undoubtedly
endorse
candidates
when
the
time
comes
after
inspiring
this
i
think
we
should
certainly
follow
through
on
it
he
declared
it
has
become
our
responsibility
and
i
hope
that
the
citizens
group
will
spearhead
the
movement
he
said
he
would
not
be
surprised
if
some
of
the
more
than
members
of
the
group
are
interested
in
running
on
the
required
non
partisan
ballot
for
posts
on
the
charter
commission
our
most
immediate
goal
is
to
increase
public
awareness
of
the
movement
he
indicated
and
to
tell
them
what
this
will
mean
for
the
town
he
expects
that
if
the
present
timetable
is
followed
a
vote
will
be
scheduled
during
the
last
week
in
september
some
opposition
to
the
home
rule
movement
started
to
be
heard
yesterday
with
spokesmen
for
the
town
s
insurgent
democratic
leadership
speaking
out
against
the
home
rule
charter
in
favor
of
the
model
municipal
league
charter
increasing
opposition
can
be
expected
in
coming
weeks
it
was
indicated
misunderstanding
of
the
real
meaning
of
a
home
rule
charter
was
cited
as
a
factor
which
has
caused
the
citizens
group
to
obtain
signatures
under
what
were
termed
false
pretenses
several
signers
affixed
their
names
it
was
learned
after
being
told
that
no
tax
increase
would
be
possible
without
consent
of
the
general
assembly
and
that
a
provision
could
be
included
in
the
charter
to
have
the
town
take
over
the
johnston
sanitary
district
sewer
system
action
on
a
new
ordinance
permitting
motorists
who
plead
guilty
to
minor
traffic
offenses
to
pay
fines
at
the
local
police
station
may
be
taken
at
monday
s
special
north
providence
town
council
meeting
council
president
frank
sanantonio
said
yesterday
he
may
ask
the
council
to
formally
request
town
solicitor
michael
a
abatuno
to
draft
the
ordinance
at
the
last
session
of
the
general
assembly
the
town
was
authorized
to
adopt
such
an
ordinance
as
a
means
of
making
enforcement
of
minor
offenses
more
effective
nothing
has
been
done
yet
to
take
advantage
of
the
enabling
legislation
at
present
all
offenses
must
be
taken
to
sixth
district
court
for
disposition
local
police
have
hesitated
to
prosecute
them
because
of
the
heavy
court
costs
involved
even
for
the
simplest
offense
plainfield
james
p
mitchell
and
sen
walter
h
jones
r
bergen
last
night
disagreed
on
the
value
of
using
as
a
campaign
issue
a
remark
by
richard
j
hughes
democratic
gubernatorial
candidate
that
the
gop
is
campaigning
on
the
carcass
of
eisenhower
republicanism
mitchell
was
for
using
it
jones
against
and
sen
wayne
dumont
jr
r
warren
did
not
mention
it
when
the
three
republican
gubernatorial
candidates
spoke
at
staggered
intervals
before
persons
at
the
park
hotel
the
controversial
remark
was
first
made
sunday
by
hughes
at
a
westfield
young
democratic
club
cocktail
party
at
the
scotch
plains
country
club
it
was
greeted
with
a
chorus
of
boos
by
women
in
trenton
monday
at
a
forum
of
the
state
federation
of
women
s
clubs
hughes
said
monday
it
is
the
apparent
intention
of
the
republican
party
to
campaign
on
the
carcass
of
what
they
call
eisenhower
republicanism
but
the
heart
stopped
beating
and
the
lifeblood
congealed
after
eisenhower
retired
now
he
s
gone
the
republican
party
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
sell
the
tattered
remains
to
the
people
of
the
state
sunday
he
had
added
we
can
love
eisenhower
the
man
even
if
we
considered
him
a
mediocre
president
but
there
is
nothing
left
of
the
republican
party
without
his
leadership
mitchell
said
the
statement
should
become
a
major
issue
in
the
primary
and
the
fall
campaign
how
can
a
man
with
any
degree
of
common
decency
charge
this
he
asked
the
former
secretary
of
labor
said
he
was
proud
to
be
an
eisenhower
republican
and
proud
to
have
absorbed
his
philosophy
while
working
in
his
adminstration
mitchell
said
the
closeness
of
the
outcome
in
last
fall
s
presidential
election
did
not
mean
that
eisenhower
republicanism
was
a
dead
issue
regrets
attack
jones
said
he
regretted
hughes
had
made
a
personal
attack
on
a
past
president
he
is
wrong
to
inject
eisenhower
into
this
campaign
he
said
because
the
primary
is
being
waged
on
state
issues
and
i
will
not
be
forced
into
re
arguing
an
old
national
campaign
the
audience
last
night
did
not
respond
with
either
applause
or
boos
to
mention
of
hughes
remark
dumont
spoke
on
the
merit
of
having
an
open
primary
he
then
launched
into
what
the
issues
should
be
in
the
campaign
state
aid
to
schools
the
continuance
of
railroad
passenger
service
the
proper
uses
of
surplus
funds
of
the
port
of
new
york
authority
and
making
new
jersey
attractive
to
new
industry
decries
joblessness
mitchell
decried
the
high
rate
of
unemployment
in
the
state
and
said
the
meyner
administration
and
the
republican
controlled
state
senate
must
share
the
blame
for
this
nothing
that
plainfield
last
year
had
lost
the
mack
truck
co
plant
he
said
industry
will
not
come
into
this
state
until
there
is
tax
reform
but
i
am
not
in
favor
of
a
sales
or
state
income
tax
at
this
time
mitchell
said
jones
unhappy
that
the
candidates
were
limited
to
eight
minutes
for
a
speech
and
no
audience
questions
saved
his
barbs
for
mitchell
he
said
mitchell
is
against
the
centralization
of
government
in
washington
but
looks
to
the
kennedy
administration
for
aid
to
meet
new
jersey
school
and
transportation
crises
he
calls
for
help
while
saying
he
is
against
centralization
but
you
ca
n
t
have
it
both
ways
jones
said
the
state
is
now
faced
with
the
immediate
question
of
raising
new
taxes
whether
on
utilities
real
estate
or
motor
vehicles
he
said
and
i
challenge
mitchell
to
tell
the
people
where
he
stands
on
the
tax
issue
defends
ike
earlier
mitchell
said
in
a
statement
i
think
that
all
americans
will
resent
deeply
the
statements
made
about
president
eisenhower
by
richard
j
hughes
his
reference
to
discredited
carcass
or
tattered
remains
of
the
president
s
leadership
is
an
insult
to
the
man
who
led
our
forces
to
victory
in
the
greatest
war
in
all
history
to
the
man
who
was
twice
elected
overwhelmingly
by
the
american
people
as
president
of
the
united
states
and
who
has
been
the
symbol
to
the
world
of
the
peace
loving
intentions
of
the
free
nations
i
find
it
hard
to
understand
how
anyone
seeking
a
position
in
public
life
could
demonstrate
such
poor
judgment
and
bad
taste
such
a
vicious
statement
can
only
have
its
origin
in
the
desire

to
try

make
his

known
by
condemning

campaigning

is
a

it
is
a
desperate
effort
to
prop
up
a
sagging
candidate
who
has
proven
he
can
not
answer
any
questions
about
new

s
problems
we
have
witnessed
in
this

the
effort
to
project
mr

as
the
image
of
a

from

that
failed
we
are

of

we

and
not
what

hughes
said
the
three
republican
candidates
for
governor
are
tripping
over
their
feet
for
popular
slogans
to
win
the
primary
but
we
ll
have
a

well
planned
forward
looking
honest
platform
we

not
talk
out

out

plan
for

the

the

is
to

on
a

basis
hughes
said
this
is
not
a
plan
to
conquer
space
but
to
conserve
it
pointing
out
the
state
population
has
increased
each
year
since
he
said
morris

is
rapidly
changing
and
unless

in

the

he
said
no

what

he
takes
it
would
be
misconstrued
that
he
was
sympathetic
to
one
or
the
other
of
the

was
made
to
mrs

is
stepping
down
after

on

she
also
was
the
original

from

in
the
early

following
adoption
of

she
served
one
four
year
term
on

national
committee
resentment
welled
up
yesterday
among
democratic
district
leaders
and
some
county
leaders
at
reports
that
mayor
wagner
had
decided
to
seek
a
third
term
with
paul
r
screvane
and
abraham
d
beame
as
running
mates
at
the
same
time
reaction
among
anti
organization
democratic
leaders
and
in
the
liberal
party
to
the
mayor
s
reported
plan
was
generally
favorable
some
anti
organization
democrats
saw
in
the
program
an
opportunity
to
end
the
bitter
internal
fight
within
the
democratic
party
that
has
been
going
on
for
the
last
three
years
the
resentment
among
democratic
organization
leaders
to
the
reported
wagner
plan
was
directed
particularly
at
the
mayor
s
efforts
to
name
his
own
running
mates
without
consulting
the
leaders
some
viewed
this
attempt
as
evidence
that
mr
wagner
regarded
himself
as
bigger
than
the
party
opposition
reported
some
democratic
district
and
county
leaders
are
reported
trying
to
induce
state
controller
arthur
levitt
of
brooklyn
to
oppose
mr
wagner
for
the
mayoral
nomination
in
the
sept
democratic
primary
these
contend
there
is
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
mr
wagner
has
the
confidence
of
the
democratic
rank
and
file
in
the
city
their
view
is
that
last
minute
changes
the
mayor
is
proposing
to
make
in
the
democratic
ticket
only
emphasize
the
weakness
of
his
performance
as
mayor
in
an
apparent
effort
to
head
off
such
a
rival
primary
slate
mr
wagner
talked
by
telephone
yesterday
with
representative
charles
a
buckley
the
bronx
democratic
leader
and
with
joseph
t
sharkey
the
brooklyn
democratic
leader
mayor
visits
buckley
as
usual
he
made
no
attempt
to
get
in
touch
with
carmine
g
de
sapio
the
manhattan
leader
he
is
publicly
on
record
as
believing
mr
de
sapio
should
be
replaced
for
the
good
of
the
party
last
night
the
mayor
visited
mr
buckley
at
the
bronx
leader
s
home
for
a
discussion
of
the
situation
apparently
he
believes
mr
buckley
holds
the
key
to
the
democratic
organization
s
acceptance
of
his
choices
for
running
mates
without
a
struggle
in
talks
with
mr
buckley
last
week
in
washington
the
mayor
apparently
received
the
bronx
leader
s
assent
to
dropping
controller
lawrence
e
gerosa
who
lives
in
the
bronx
from
this
year
s
ticket
but
mr
buckley
seems
to
have
assumed
he
would
be
given
the
right
to
pick
mr
gerosa
s
successor
screvane
and
beame
hailed
the
mayor
declined
in
two
interviews
with
reporters
yesterday
to
confirm
or
deny
the
reports
that
he
had
decided
to
run
and
wanted
mr
screvane
who
lives
in
queens
to
replace
abe
stark
the
incumbent
as
the
candidate
for
president
of
the
city
council
and
mr

who
lives
in

the

spoke
yesterday
at
the
united
irish
counties
feis
on
the
hunter
college
campus
in

bronx
after
his
speech
reporters
asked
him
about
the
report
of
his
political
intentions
published
in
yesterday
s
new

times
the
mayor
said
it
did
n
t
come
from
me
but
as
i
have
said
before
if
i
announce
my
candidacy
i
will
have
something
definite
to
say
about
running

boston
june
a
wave
of
public
resentment
against
corruption
in
government
is
rising
in
massachusetts
there
is
a
tangible
feeling
in
the
air
of
revulsion
toward
politics
the

says
the
hand
is
out
a
political
scientist
writes
of
the
growth
of
alienated
voters
who
believe
that
voting
is
useless
because
politicians
or
those
who
influence
politicians
are
corrupt
selfish
and
beyond
popular
control
these
voters
view
the
political
process
as
a
secret
conspiracy
the
object
of
which
is
to
plunder
them
corruption
is
hardly
a
recent
development
in
the
city

state
that
were
widely
identified
as
the
locale
of

the

there
are
reasons
for
the
current

aroused
the
public
within
the
last
year
graft
in

works
has
brought

investigations
and
the

has
attracted
new
attention
to
the
ethical
climate
of
his

state
a
reader
of
the
boston

can
hardly
escape
the
impression
that
petty
chicanery
or
worse
is
the
norm
in
massachusetts
public
life
day

some
new
episode

reported

without
any
major

the

jockeying

the

is
now
in

house
rules
committee
it
is
expected
to
be
reported
out
tuesday
but
this
is
a
little
uncertain

leadership
is
hopeful
the
housing
bill
is
expected
to
encounter
strong
opposition
by
the
coalition
of
southern
democrats
and
conservative
republicans
the
democratic
leadership
however
hopes
to
pass
it
sometime
this
week
the
measure
which
was
passed
last
monday
by
the
senate
provides
for
forty
year
mortgages
at
low
down
payments
for
moderate
income
families
it
also
provides
for
funds
to
clear
slums
and
help
colleges
build
dormitories
the
education
bill
appears
to
be
temporarily
stalled
in
the
rules
committee
where
two
northern
democratic
members
who
usually
vote
with
the
administration
are
balking
because
of
the
religious
controversy
they
are
james
j
delaney
of
queens
and
thomas
p
o
neill
jr
of
massachusetts
three
groups
to
meet
what
could
rescue
the
bill
would
be
some
quick
progress
on
a
bill
amending
the
national
defense
education
act
of
this
would
provide
for
long
term
federal
loans
for

of
parochial
and
other
private
school
facilities
for

mr
delaney
and
mr

are
not
willing
to
vote
on
the
public
school
measure
until
the
defense
education
bill
clears
the
house
education
and

about
half
of
all
peace

assigned
to

will
be
carried

by

according
to
an
official
of
the

in
the

that
has
been
submitted
for

approval

gordon

director
of

with

said
in
a
washington
interview
six
of
these
were
proposed
by
religious

they
will
be
for
teaching

and
community
development
in
southeast
asia

the
middle

and
latin

question
raised
interviews
with
several
church
leaders
have
disclosed
that
this
development
has
raised
the
question
whether
the
peace
corps
will
be
able
to
prevent
confusion
for
church
and
state
over
methods
means
and
goals
there
are
a
number
of
ways
this
could
happen
the
churchmen
pointed
out
and
here
is
an
example
last
month
in
ghana
an
american
missionary
discovered
when
he
came
to
pay
his
hotel
bill
that
the
usual
rate
had
been
doubled
when
he
protested
the
hotel
owner
said
why
do
you
worry
the
u
s
government
is
paying
for
it
the
u
s
government
pays
for
all
its
overseas
workers
missionary
explains
i
do
n
t
work
for
the
government
the
american
said
i
m
a
missionary
the
hotel
owner
shrugged
same
thing
he
said
and
then
some
churchmen
remarked
there
is
a
more
classical
church
state
problem
can
religious
agencies
use
government
funds
and
peace
corps
personnel
in
their
projects
and
still
preserve
the
constitutional
requirement
on
separation
of
church
and
state

no
script
from
the

is
worth
very
much
in
gazing
into
the

this
is
largely
because
of
the
unpredictability

operates

of

is
the

ross

barnett
who
came
into
office
with
no
previous
experience
in
public
administration
has
surrounded
himself
with
confusion
which
not
only
keeps
his
foes
guessing
but
his
friends
as
well
consequently
it
is
uncertain
after
nearly
months
in
office
just
which
direction
the
barnett
administration
will
take
in
the
coming
year
could
be
scramble

predict
the
administration
will
settle
down
during
and
iron
out
the
rough
edges
which
it
has
had
thus
far
the
builtin
headache
of
the
barnett
regime
thus
far
has
been
the
steady
stream
of
job
seekers
and
others
who
feel
they
were
given
commitments
by
barnett
at
some
stage
of
his
eight
year
quest
for
the
governor
s
office
there
are
many
who
predict
that
should
barnett
decide
to
call
the
legislature
back
into
special
session
it
will
really
throw
his
administration
into
a
scramble
certainly
nobody
will
predict
that
the
next
time
the
lawmakers
come
back
together
barnett
will
be
able
to
enjoy
a
re
enactment
of
the
strange
but
successful
honeymoon
he
had
in
the
legislative
session
if
barnett
does
n
t
call
a
special

in
it
will
be
the
first
year
in
the
last
decade
that
the

legislators
always
get
restless
for
a
special
session
whether
for
the
companionship
or
the
per
diem
is
not
certain
and
if
they
start
agitating
barnett
is
not
expected
to
be
able
to
withstand
the
pressure
the
issue
which
may
make
it
necessary
to
have
a
session
is
the
highly
sensitive
problem
of
cutting
the
state
s
congressional
districts
from
six
to
five
to
eliminate
one
congressional
seat
with
eyes
focused
on
the

the
historic
delta
district
and
congressman
frank

smith
as
the
one
most
likely

it
back

future
clouded
barnett

the
titular
head
of
the

apparently
must
make
the
move
to
reestablish
relations
with

democratic
party
or
see
a
movement
come
from
the
loyalist
ranks
to
completely
bypass
him

that

appears
to
face
a
difficult
year
in
with

s
theme
of
peace
and
harmony
subjected
to
severe
stresses
the
year
will
probably
start
out
with
segregation
still
the
most
troublesome
issue
but
it
might
give
way
shortly
to
another
vexing
issue
that
of
finances
in
state
government
the
transition
from
segregation
to
finances
might
already
be
in
progress
in
the
form
of
an
administration
proposal
to
hike
the
state
sales
tax
from
per
cent
to
per
cent
the
administration
has
said
the
sales
tax
proposal
is
merely
part
of
the
segregation
strategy
since
the
revenues
from
the
increase
would
be
dedicated
to
a
grant
in
aid
program
but
the
tardiness
of
the
administration
in
making
the
dedication
has
caused
legislators
to
suspect
the
tax
bill
was
related
more
directly
to
an
over
all
shortage
of
cash
than
to
segregation
legislators
weary
indeed
the
administration
s
curious
position
on
the
sales
tax
was
a
major
factor
in
contributing
to
its
defeat
the
administration
could
not
say
why
million
was
needed
for
a
grant
in
aid
program
the
effectiveness
of
the
governor
in
clearing
up
some
of
the
inconsistencies
revolving
about
the
sales
tax
bill
may
play
a
part
in
determining
whether
it
can
muster
the
required
two
thirds
vote
the
tax
bill
will
be
up
for
reconsideration
wednesday
in
the
house
when
the
legislature
reconvenes
davis
may
use
the
tax
bill
as
a
means
to
effect
a
transition
from
special
sessions
of
the
legislature
to
normalcy
if
it
fails
to
pass
he
can
throw
up
his
hands
and
say
the
legislature
would
not
support
him
in
his
efforts
to
prevent
integration
he
could
terminate
special
sessions
of
the
legislature
actually
davis
would
have
to
toss
in
the
towel
soon
anyway
many
legislators
are
already
weary
and
frustrated
over
the
so
far
losing
battle
to
block
token
integration
this
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
most
politicos
would
care
to
acknowledge
publicly
they
would
like
to
convey
the
notion
something
is
being
done
even
though
it
is
something
they
know
to
be
ineffectual
underlying
concern
passage
of
the
sales
tax
measure
would
also
give
davis
the
means
to
effect
a
transition
he
could
tell
the
legislature
they
had
provided
the
needed
funds
to
carry
on
the
battle
then
he
could
tell
them
to
go
home
while
the
administration
continued
to
wage
the
battle
with
the
million
in
extra
revenues
the
sales
tax
measure
would
bring
in
over
an
eight
months
period
it
is
difficult
to
be
certain
how
the
administration
views
that
million
since
the
views
of
one
leader
may
not
be
the
same
as
the
views
of
another
one
but
if
the
administration
should
find
it
does
not
need
the
million
for
a
grant
in
aid
program
a
not
unlikely
conclusion
it
could
very
well
seek
a
way
to
use
the
money
for
other
purposes
this
would
be
in
perfect
consonance
with
the
underlying
concern
in
the
administration
the
shortage
of
cash
it
could
become
an
acute
problem
in
the
coming
fiscal
year
if
the
administration
does
not
succeed
in
passing
the
sales
tax
bill
or
any
other
tax
bill
it
could
very
well
be
faced
this
spring
at
the
fiscal
session
of
the
legislature
with
an
interesting
dilemma
since
the
constitution
forbids
introduction
of
a
tax
bill
at
a
fiscal
session
the
administration
will
either
have
to
cut
down
expenses
or
inflate
its
estimates
of
anticipated
revenues
constant
problem
in
either
case
it
could
call
a
special
session
of
the
legislature
later
in
to
make
another
stab
at
raising
additional
revenues
through
a
tax
raiser
the
prospect
of
cutting
back
spending
is
an
unpleasant
one
for
any
governor
it
is
one
that
most
try
to
avoid
as
long
as
they
can
see
an
alternative
approach
to
the
problem
but
if
all
alternatives
should
be
clearly
blocked
off
it
can
be
expected
the
davis
administration
will
take
steps
to
trim
spending
at
the
spring
session
of
the
state
legislature
this
might
be
done
to
arouse
those
who
have
been
squeezed
out
by
the
trims
to
exert
pressure
on
the
legislature
so
it
would
be
more
receptive
to
a
tax
proposal
later
in
the
year
a
constant
problem
confronting
davis
on
any
proposals
for
new
taxes
will
be
the
charge
by
his
foes
that
he
has
not
tried
to
economize
any
tax
bill
also
will
revive
allegations
that
some
of
his
followers
have
been
using
their
administration
affiliations
imprudently
to
profit
themselves
the
new
year
might
see
some
house
cleaning
either
genuine
or
token
depending
upon
developments
to
give
davis
an
opportunity
to
combat
some
of
these
criticisms
city
controller
alexander
hemphill
charged
tuesday
that
the
bids
on
the
frankford
elevated
repair
project
were
rigged
to
the
advantage
of
a
private
contracting
company
which
had
an
inside
track
with
the
city
estimates
of
the
city
s
loss
in
the
job
have
ranged
as
high
as
shortcuts
unnoticed
hemphill
said
that
the
hughes
steel
erection
co
contracted
to
do
the
work
at
an
impossibly
low
cost
with
a
bid
that
was
far
less
than
the
legitimate
bids
of
competing
contractors
the
hughes
concern
then
took
shortcuts
on
the
project
but
got
paid
anyway

the

e
m
martin
assistant

for

told
members
of

world
affairs
council
monday
night
martin
who
has
been
in
office
in
washington
d
c
for
months
spoke
at
the
council
s
annual
meeting
at
the
multnomah
hotel
he
told
some
persons
that
the
united
states
challenge
was
to
help
countries
build
their
own
societies
their
own
ways
following
their
own
paths
we
must
persuade
them
to
enjoy
a
way
of
life
which
if
not
identical
is
congenial
with
ours
he
said
but
adding
that
if
they
do
not
develop
the
kind
of
society
they
themselves
want
it
will
lack
ritiuality
and
loyalty
patience
needed
insuring
that
the
countries
have
a
freedom
of
choice
he
said
was
the
biggest
detriment
to
the
soviet
union
he
cited
east
germany
where
after
years
of
soviet
rule
it
has
become
necessary
to
build
a
wall
to
keep
the
people
in
and
added
so
long
as
people
rebel
we
must
not
give
up
martin
called
for
patience
on
the
part
of
americans
the
countries
are
trying
to
build
in
a
decade
the
kind
of
society
we
took
a
century
to
build
he
said
by
leaving
our
doors
open
the
united
states
gives
other
peoples
the
opportunity
to
see
us
and
to
compare
he
said
individual
help
best
we
have
no
reason
to
fear
failure
but
we
must
be
extraordinarily
patient
the
assistant
secretary
said
economically
martin
said
the
united
states
could
best
help
foreign
countries
by
helping
them
help
themselves
private
business
is
more
effective
than
government
aid
he
explained
because
individuals
are
able
to
work
with
the
people
themselves
the
united
states
must
plan
to
absorb
the
exported
goods
of
the
country
at
what
he
termed
a
social
cost
martin
said
the
government
has
been
working
to
establish
firmer
prices
on
primary
products
which
may
involve
the
total

of

country
the
portland
school
board
was
asked
monday
to
take
a
positive
stand
towards
developing
and
coordinating
with
portland
s
civil
defense
more
plans
for
the
city
s
schools
in
event
of
attack
but
there
seemed
to
be
some
difference
of
opinion
as
to
how
far
the
board
should
go
and
whose
advice
it
should
follow
the
board
members
after
hearing
the
coordination
plea
from
mrs
ralph
h
molvar
sw
maplecrest
dr
said
they
thought
they
had
already
been
cooperating
chairman
c
richard
mears
pointed
out
that
perhaps
this
was
not
strictly
a
school
board
problem
in
case
of
atomic
attack
but
that
the
board
would
cooperate
so
far
as
possible
to
get
the
children
to
where
the
parents
wanted
them
to
go
dr
melvin
w
barnes
superintendent
said
he
thought
the
schools
were
waiting
for
some
leadership
perhaps
on
the
national
level
to
make
sure
that
whatever
steps
of
planning
they
took
would
be
more
fruitful
and
that
he
had
found
that
other
school
districts
were
not
as
far
along
in
their
planning
as
this
district
los
angeles
has
said
they
would
send
the
children
to
their
homes
in
case
of
disaster
he
said
nobody
really
expects
to
evacuate
i
think
everybody
is
agreed
that
we
need
to
hear
some
voice
on
the
national
level
that
would
make
some
sense
and
in
which
we
would
have
some
confidence
in
following
mrs
molvar
who
kept
reiterating
her
request
that
they
please
take
a
stand
said
we
must
have
faith
in
somebody
on
the
local
level
and
it
would
n
t
be
possible
for
everyone
to
rush
to
a
school
to
get
their
children
dr
barnes
said
that

at

the
council
revised
in
an
effort
to
strengthen
the
denomination
s
basic
beliefs
adopted
in
the
changes
unanimously
adopted
were
felt
necessary
in
the
face
of
modern
trends
away
from
the
bible
the
council
agreed
it
should
more
firmly
state
its
belief
in
and
dependence
on
the
bible
at
the
adoption
the
rev
t
f
zimmerman
general
superintendent
commented
the
assemblies
of
god
has
been
a
bulwark
for
fundamentalism
in
these
modern
days
and
has
without
compromise
stood
for
the
great
truths
of
the
bible
for
which
men
in
the
past
have
been
willing
to
give
their
lives
new
point
added
many
changes
involved
minor
editing
and
clarification
however
the
first
belief
stood
for
entire
revision
with
a
new
third
point
added
to
the
list
the
first
of
beliefs
of
the
denomination
now
reads
the
scriptures
both
old
and
new
testament
are
verbally
inspired
of
god
and
are
the
revelation
of
god
to
man
the
infallible
authoritative
rule
of
faith
and
conduct
the
third
belief
in
six
points
emphasizes
the
diety
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
emphasizes
the
virgin
birth
the
sinless
life
of
christ
his
miracles
his
substitutionary
work
on
the
cross
his
bodily
resurrection
from
the
dead
and
his
exaltation
to
the
right
hand
of
god

again

the

the

scheduled

fill
the
churches
for
the
next
two
years
in
his
opening
address
wednesday
the

mr

urged
the

to
consider
a

expansion

with
breakthrough
the
theme
for
the
first
two
years
the
rev
r
l
brandt
national
secretary
of
the
home
missions
department
stressed
the
need
for
the
first
two
years
work
surveys
show
that
one
out
of
three
americans
has
vital
contact
with
the
church
this
means
that
more
than
million
have
no
vital
touch
with
the
church
or
religious
life
he
told
delegates
friday
church
loses
pace
talking
of
the
rapid
population
growth
upwards
of
babies
born
daily
with
an
immigrant
entering
the
united

every

he
said
our
organization
has
not
been
keeping
pace
with
this
challenge
in
years
we
have
opened
churches
the
rev
mr
brandt
said
adding
that
the
denomination
had
a
national
goal
of
one
church
for
every
persons
in
this
light
we
need
churches
in
illinois
where
we
have
in
southern
new
england
we
have
we
need
in
rhode
island
we
have
none
he
said
to
step
up
the
denomination
s
program
the
rev
mr
brandt
suggested
the
vision
of
new
assemblies
of
god
churches
in
the
next
years
to
accomplish
this
would
necessitate
some
changes
in
methods
he
said
church
meets
change
the
church
s
ability
to
change
her
methods
is
going
to
determine
her
ability
to
meet
the
challenge
of
this
hour
a
capsule
view
of
proposed
plans
includes
encouraging
by
every
means
all
existing
assemblies
of
god
churches
to
start
new
churches
engaging
mature
experienced
men
to
pioneer
or
open
new
churches
in
strategic
population
centers
surrounding
pioneer
pastors
with
vocational
volunteers
laymen
who
will
be
urged

goes

he
never

several
every

in

out

moritz
does

even
have
a

but
he
s
one
of
the
most
valuable
members
of
the
longhorn
team
that
will
be
heavily
favored
saturday
over
oklahoma
in
the
cotton
bowl
that
s
because
he
already
has
kicked
extra
points
in

he
ran
his

successful
conversions
this

straight
before

went

as
a

halfback

position
at
which
he
lettered
on

team

ask

what
position
he
plays

get

quick
response
place
kicker
a
pound
foot
inch
senior
from
stamford
moritz
practices
nothing
but
place
kicking
last
year
when
he
worked
out
at
halfback
all
season
he
did
n
t
get
into
a
single
game
this
year
coach
royal
told
me
if
i
d
work
on
my
place
kicking
he
thought
he
could
use
me
said
moritz
so
i
started
practicing
on
it
in
spring
training
moritz
was
bothered
during
the
first
two
games
this
year
by
a
pulled
muscle
in
the
thigh
of
his
right
kicking
leg
and
as
a
result
several
of
his
successful
conversions
have
gone
barely
far
enough
moritz
said
monday
his
leg
feels
fine
and
as
a
result
he
hopes
to
start
practicing
field
goals
this
week
he
kicked
several
while
playing
at
stamford
high
school
including
one
that
beat
anson
in
a
district
game
i
kicked
about
extra
points
in
tries
during
three
years
in
high
school
he
said
and
made
in
a
row
at
one
time
i
never
did
miss
one
in
a
playoff
game
i
kicked
about
in
the
five
playoff
games
my
last
two
years
moritz
came
to
texas
in
but
his
freshman
football
efforts
were
hampered
by
a
knee
injury
he
missed
the
season
because
of
an
operation
on
the
ailing
knee
then
played
minutes
in
his
statistical
record
that
year
when
texas
won
only
one
game
and
lost
nine
was
far
from
impressive
he
carried
the
ball
three
times
for
a
net
gain
of
yards
punted
once
for
yards
and
caught
one
pass
for
yards
he
went
into
the
army
in
march
and
returned
two
years
later
but
he
was
scholastically
ineligible
in
and
merely
present
last
season
place
kicking
is
largely
a
matter
of
timing
moritz
declared
once
you
get
the
feel
of
it
there
s
not
much
to
it
i
ve
tried
to
teach
some
of
the
other
boys
to
kick
and
some
of
them
ca
n
t
seem
to
get
the
feel
practice
helps
you
to
get
your
timing
down
it
s
kind
of
like
golf
if
you
do
n
t
swing
a
club
very
often
your
timing
gets
off
moritz
however
kicks
only
about
or
extra
points
during
each
practice
session
if
you
kick
too
much
your
leg
gets
kinda
dead
he
explained
footnotes
in
their
first
three
games
the
longhorns
have
had
the
ball
times
and
scored
times
or
per
cent
their
total
passing
yardage
in
three
games
on
completions
in
attempts
is
only
yards
short
of
their
total
passing
yardage
in
when
they
made
on
completions
in
tries
tailback
james
saxton
already
has
surpassed
his
rushing
total
for
his
brilliant
sophomore
season
when
he
netted
yards
on
carries
he
now
has
yards
in
tries
during
three
games
saxton
has
made
only
one
second
half
appearance
this
season
and
that
was
in
the
washington
state
game
for
four
plays
he
returned
the
kickoff
yards
gained
five
yards
through
the
line
and
then
uncorked
a
yard
touchdown
run
before
retiring
to
the
bench
wingback
jack
collins
injured
a
knee
in
the
washington
state
game
but
insists
he
ll
be
ready
for
oklahoma
last
week
when
royal
was
informed
that
three
longhorns
were
among
the
conference
s
top
four
in
rushing
he
said
that
wo
n
t
last
long
it
did
n
t
monday
he
had
four
longhorns
in
the
top
four
a
good
feeling
prevailed
on
the
smu
coaching
staff
monday
but
attention
quickly
turned
from
saturday
s
victory
to
next
week
s
problem
rice
university
the
mustangs
do
n
t
play
this
week
we
re
just
real
happy
for
the
players
coach
bill
meek
said
of
the
victory
over
the
air
force
academy
i
think
the
big
thing
about
the
game
was
that
our
kids
for
the
third
straight
week
stayed
in
there
pitching
and
kept
the
pressure
on
it
was
the
first
time
we
ve
been
ahead
this
season
when
john
richey
kicked
what
proved
to
be
the
winning
field
goal
assistant
coach
john
cudmore
described
victory
as
a
good
feeling
i
think
on
the
part
of
the
coaches
and
the
players
we
needed
it
and
we
got
it
meek
expressed
particular
gratification
at
the
defensive
performances
of
end
happy
nelson
and
halfback
billy
gannon
both
turned
in
top
jobs
for
the
second
straight
game
nelson
played
magnificent
football
meek
praised
he
knocked
down
the
interference
and
made
key
stops
lots
of
times
and
he
caused
the
fumble
that
set
up
our
touchdown
he
broke
that
boy
air
force
fullback
nick
arshinkoff
in
two
and
knocked
him
loose
from
the
football
gannon
contributed
saving
plays
on
the
falcons
aerial
thrusts
in
the
late
stages
one
was
on
a
fourth
down
screen
pass
from
the
mustang
after
an
incomplete
pass
into
gannon
s
territory
as
soon
as
it
started
to
form
gannon
spotted
it
meek
said
he
timed
it
just
right
and
broke
through
there
before
the
boy
halfback
terry
isaacson
had
time
to
turn
around
he
really
crucified
him
he
nailed
it
for
a
yard
loss
the
air
force
s
and
the
game
s
final
play
was
a
long
pass
by
quarterback
bob
mcnaughton
which
gannon
intercepted
on
his
own
and
returned
yards
he
just
lay
back
there
and
waited
for
it
meek
said
he
almost
brought
it
back
all
the
way
except
for
sophomore
center
mike
kelsey
and
fullback
mike
rice
meek
expects
the
squad
to
be
physically
sound
for
rice
kelsey
is
very
doubtful
for
the
rice
game
meek
said
he
ll
be
out
of
action
all
this
week
he
got
hit
from
the
blind
side
by
the
split
end
coming
back
on
the
second
play
of
the
game
there
is
definitely
some
ligament
damage
in
his
knee
rice
has
not
played
since
injuring
a
knee
in
the
opener
with
maryland
he
s
looking
a
lot
better
and
he

able
to
run
meek
explained
we
ll
let
him
do
a
lot
of
running
this
week
but
i
do
n
t
know
if
he
ll
be

with

victory
in

american
football
league
starts
a
triumph
over
the
denver
broncos
but
their
visit
will
be
a
short
one
the
texans
have
two
more
road
games
at
buffalo
and
houston
before
they
play
for
the
home
folks
again
and
it
looks
as
if
coach
hank
stram
s
men
will
meet
the
bills
just
as
they
are
developing
into
the
kind
of
team
they
were
expected
to
be
in
pre
season
reckonings
buffalo
coach
buster
ramsey
who
has
become
one
of
the
game
s
greatest
collectors
of
quarterbacks
apparently
now
has
found
a
productive
pair
in
two
ex
national
football
leaguers
m
c
reynolds
and
warren
rabb
rabb
the
former
louisiana
state
field
general
came
off
the
bench
for
his
debut
with
the
bills
sunday
and
directed
his
new
team
to
a
upset
victory
over
the
houston
oilers
defending
league
champions
just
our
luck
exclaimed
stram
buster
would
solve
that
quarterback
problem
just
as
we
head
that
way
ramsey
has
a
thing
or
two
to
mutter
about
himself
for
the
dallas
defensive
unit
turned
in
another
splendid
effort
against
denver
and
the
texans
were
able
to
whip
the
dangerous
broncs
without
the
fullbacking
of
a
top
star
jack
spikes
though
he
did
the
team
s
place
kicking
while
nursing
a
knee
injury
our
interior
line
and
out
linebackers
played
exceptionally
well
said
stram
monday
after
he
and
his
staff
reviewed
movies
of
the
game
in
fact
our
whole
defensive
unit
did
a
good
job
the
texans
won
the
game
through
ball
control
with
quarterback
cotton
davidson
throwing
only
passes
we
always
like
to
keep
the
ball
as
much
as
we
can
against
denver
because
they
have
such
an
explosive
attack
explained
stram
they
can
be
going
along
doing
little
damage
then
bang
bang
they
can
hit
a
couple
of
passes
on
you
for
touchdowns
and
put
you
in
trouble
the
broncs
did
hit
two
quick
strikes
in
the
final
period
against
the
texans
but
dallas
had
enough
of
a
lead
to
hold
them
off
the
principal
tactic
in
controlling
the
ball
was
giving
it
to
abner
haynes
the
flashy
halfback
he
was
called
upon
times
more
than
all
of
the
other
ball
carriers
combined
and
delivered
yards
the
texans
made
themselves
a
comforting
break
on
the
opening
kickoff
when
denver
s
al
carmichael
was
jarred
loose
from
the
ball
when
dave
grayson
the
speedy
halfback
hit
him
and
guard
al
reynolds
claimed
it
for
dallas
a
quick
touchdown
resulted
that
permitted
us
to
start
controlling
the
ball
right
away
said
stram
quipping
i
think
i
ll
put
that
play
in
the
book
the
early
southwest
conference
football
leaders
texas
arkansas
and
texas
a
m
made
a
big
dent
in
the
statistics
last
week
texas
yard
spree
against
washington
state
gave
the
longhorns
a
game
total
offense
of
yards
rushing
and
passing
a
new
swc
high
arkansas
combined
yards
rushing
with

and
a
tough
defense
to
whip

against

tech
ran
up
its
biggest
total

has
given
only
the

in

an
unusual
characteristic
for
a
southpaw
the
bears
took
the
lead
in
the
first
inning
as
they
did
in
sunday

and
never
lagged
dick
mcauliffe
cracked
the

was
knocked
down
by
rudolph

paschal
doubled
down
the

and
cooke
singled
off

chuck

an

jackie

said
monday
night
he
was
through
playing
baseball
i
ve
had
it
he
told
a
newsman
i
know
when
my
reflexes
are
gone
and
i
m
not
going
to
be
any
th
man
on
the
ball
club
this
was
the
first
word
from
jensen
on
his
sudden
walkout
jensen
got
only
six
hits
in
at
bats
for
a
batting
average
in
the
first
games
he
took
a
midnight
train
out
of
cleveland
saturday
without
an
official
word
to
anybody
and
has
stayed
away
from
newsmen
on
his
train
trip
across
the
nation
to
reno
nev
where
his
wife
former
olympic
diving
champion
zoe
ann
olsen
awaited
she
said
when
she
learned
jackie
was
heading
home
i
m
just
speculating
but
i
have
to
think
jack
feels
he
s
hurting
boston
s
chances
the
union
pacific
railroad
streamliner
city
of
san
francisco
stopped
in
ogden
utah
for
a
few
minutes
sports
writer
ensign
ritchie
of
the
ogden
standard
examiner
went
to
his
compartment
to
talk
with
him
the
conductor
said
to
ritchie
i
do
n
t
think
you
want
to
talk
to
him
you
ll
probably
get
a
ball
bat
on
the
head
he
s
mad
at
the
world
but
jackie
had
gone
into
the
station
ritchie
walked
up
to
him
at
the
magazine
stand
i
told
him
who
i
was
and
he
was
quite
cold
but
he
warmed
up
after
a
while
i
told
him
what
liston
had
said
and
he
said
liston
was
a
double
crosser
and
said
anything
he
liston
got
was
through
a
keyhole
he
said
he
had
never
talked
to
liston
liston
is
bill
liston
baseball
writer
for
the
boston
traveler
who
quoted
jensen
as
saying
i
ca
n
t
hit
anymore
i
ca
n
t
run
i
ca
n
t
throw
suddenly
my
reflexes
are
gone
just
when
it
seems
baseball
might
be
losing
its
grip
on
the
masses
up
pops
heroics
to
start
millions
of
tongues
to
wagging
and
so
it
was
over
the
weekend
what
with
year
old
warren
spahn
pitching
his
no
hit
masterpiece
against
the
giants
and
the
giants
willie
mays
retaliating
with
a
record
tying
homer
spree
sunday
both
of
course
were
remarkable
feats
and
further
embossed
the
fact
that
baseball
rightfully
is
the
national
pastime
of
the
two
cherished
achievements
the
elderly
spahn
s
hitless
pitching
probably
reached
the
most
hearts
it
was
a
real
stimulant
to
a
lot
of
guys
i
know
who
have
moved
past
the
score
year
milestone
and
one
of
the
milwaukee
rookies
sighed
and
remarked
wish
i
was
and
a
top
grade
big
leaguer
the
modest
and
happy
spahn
waved
off
his
new
laurels
as
one
of
those
good
days
but
there
surely
can
be
no
doubt
about
the
slender
southpaw
belonging
with
the
all
time
great
lefthanders
in
the
game
s
history
yes
with
bob
grove
carl
hubbell
herb
pennock
art
nehf
vernon
gomez
et
al
spahn
not
only
is
a
superior
pitcher
but
a
gentlemanly
fine
fellow
a
ball
player
s
ball
player
as
they
say
in
the
trade
i
remember
his
beardown
performance
in
a
meaningless
exhibition
game
at
bears
stadium
oct
before
a
new
record
crowd
for
the
period
of
spahnie
does
n
t
know
how
to
merely
go
through
the
motions
remarked
enos
slaughter
another
all
out
guy
who
played
rightfield
that
day
and
popped
one
over
the
clubhouse
the
spectacular
mays
who
reaches
a
decade
in
the
big
leagues
come
may
joined
six
other
sluggers
who
walloped
four
home
runs
in
a
span
of
nine
innings
incidentally
only
two
did
it
before
a
home
audience
bobby
lowe
of
boston
was
the
first
to
hit
four
at
home
and
gil
hodges
turned
the
trick
in
brooklyn
s
ebbetts
field
ed
delahanty
and
chuck

of
the

the
braves
joe

the

and
rocky
colavito
then
with
cleveland
made
their
history
on
the
road
willie
s
big
day
revived
the
running
argument
about
the
relative
merits
of
mays
and
mickey
mantle
this
is
an
issue
which
boils
down
to
a
matter
of
opinion
depending
on
whether
you
re
an
american
or
national
fan
and
anti
or
pro
yankee
the
record
books
however
would
favor
the
giants
ace
in
four
of
his
nine
previous
seasons
mays
hit
as
many
as
home
runs
and
stole
as
many
as
bases
once
the
figure
was
willie
s
lifetime
batting
average
of
is
points
beyond
mickey
s
the
giants
who
had
been
anemic
with
the
bat
in
their
windy
candlestick
park
suddenly
found
the
formula
in
milwaukee
s
park
it
will
forever
be
a
baseball
mystery
how
a
team
will
suddenly
start
hitting
after
a
distressing
slump
the
denver
area
tv
audience
was
privileged
to
see
mays
four
home
runs
thanks
to
a
new
arrangement
made
by
bob
howsam
that
the
games
are
not
to
be
blacked
out
when
his
bears
are
playing
at
home
this
rule
providing
for
a
blackout
of
televised
baseball
minutes
before
the
start
of
a
major
or
minor
league
game
in
any
area
comes
from
the
game
s
top
rulers
the
last
couple
of
years
the
bears
management
got
the
business
from
the
living
room
athletic
club
when
games
were
cut
off
actually
they
were
helpless
to
do
anything
about
the
nationwide
policy
this
year
i
am
told
the
cbs
network
will
continue
to
abide
by
the
rule
but
nbc
will
play
to
a
conclusion
here
there
are
two
more
sunday
afternoons
when
the
situation
will
arise
it
is
an
irritable
rule
that
does
baseball
more
harm
than
good
especially
at
the
minor
league
level
you
would
be
surprised
how
many
fans
purposely
stayed
away
from
bears
stadium
last
year
because
of
the
television
policy
this
dissatisfaction
led
to
howsam
s
request
that
the
video
not
be
terminated
before
the
end
of
the
game
cincinnati
ohio

humiliating
barrage
monday
in
the
loosely
played
finale
with
mickey
mantle
and
yogi
berra
both
out
of
action
due
to
injuries
the
american
league
champs
still
mounted
a
hit
attack
against
a
parade
of
eight
cincinnati
pitchers
the
most
ever
used
by
one
team
in
a
series
game
johnny

off

during

in

the

also
took
advantage
of
three
cincinnati
errors
the
crowd

only
two
chances
to
applaud
in
the
third
frank
robinson
hammered
a
long
home
run
deep
into
the
corner
of
the
bleachers
in
right
center
about
feet
away
with
two
men
on
momentarily
the
reds
were
back
in
the
ball
game
trailing
only
but
the
drive
fizzled
when
john
edwards
fouled
out
with
men
on
second
and
third
and
two
out
in
the
fifth
wally
post
slashed
a

homer
off
bud
daley
but
by
that
time
the
score
was
and
it
really
did
n

the
yankee
triumph
made
ralph

only
the
third
man
to
lead
a
team
to
both
a
pennant
and
a
world
series
victory
in
his
first
year
as

only
bucky

a
three

believed
to
be

a

he
succeeds
buck

retired

the

was

gauer

with

choice
was
expected
the
selection
had
been
expected
skorich
was
considered
the
logical
choice
after
the

gave

was
signed
by

connection
after
he
had
refused
to
reconsider
his
decision
to
end
his
career
as
a
player
with
skorich
at
the
helm
the
eagles
are
expected
to
put
more
emphasis
on
running
rather
than
passing
in
the
past
the
club
depended
largely
on
van

aerials
skorich
however
is
a
strong
advocate
of
a
balanced

split
between
running

golf
s
golden
boy
arnold
palmer
has
been
a
blazing
figure
in
golf
over
the
past
twelve
months
he
won
the
masters
the
united
states
open
and
a
record
in
prize
money
he
was
heralded
as
sportsman
of
the
year
by
sports
illustrated
and
last
night
was
acclaimed
in
rochester
as
the
professional
athlete
of
the
year
a
distinction
that
earned
for
him
the
diamond
studded
hickok
belt
but
he
also
achieved
something
that
endeared
him
to
every
duffer
who
ever
flubbed
a
shot
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
he
scored
a
monstrous
on
a
par
hole
it
made
him
human
and
it
also
stayed
the
hands
of
thousands
of
brooding
incompetents
who
were
meditating
the
abandonment
of
a
sport
whose
frustrations
were
driving
them
to
despair
if
such
a
paragon
of
perfection
as
palmer
could
commit
such
a
scoring
sacrilege
there
was
hope
left
for
all
it
was
neither
a
spirit
of
self
sacrifice
nor
a
yen
to
encourage
the
downtrodden
that
motivated
arnold
he
merely
became
victimized
by
a
form
of
athletics
that
respects
no
one
and
aggravates
all
the
world
s
best
golfer
shooting
below
par
came
to
the
last
hole
of
the
opening
round
of
the
los
angeles
open
with
every
intention
of
delivering
a
final
crusher
he
boomed
a
yard
drive
then
the
pixies
and
the
zombies
took
over
while
the
banshees
wailed
in
the
distance
no
margin
for
error
on
the
narrow
fairway
of
a
yard
hole
arnold
whipped
into
his
second
shot
the
ball
went
off
in
a
majestic
arc
an
out
of
bounds
slice
he
tried
again
and
once
more
sliced
out
of
bounds
he
hooked
the
next
two
out
of
bounds
on
the
opposite
side
it
is
possible
that
i
over
corrected
he
said
ruefully
each
of
the
four
wayward
shots
cost
him
two
strokes
so
he
wound
up
with
a
dozen
it
was
a
nice
round
figure
that
he
said
as
he
headed
for
the
clubhouse
not
too
much
perturbed
from
the
standpoint
of
the
army
of
duffers
however
this
was
easily
the
most
heartening
exhibition
they
had
had
since
ben
hogan
fell
upon
evil
ways
during
his
heyday
and
scored
an
in
the
texas
open
the
idol
of
the
hackers
of
course
is
ray
ainsley
who
achieved
a
in
the
united
states
open
their
secondary
hero
is
another
pro
willie
chisholm
who
drank
his
lunch
during
another
open
and
tried
to
blast
his
way
out
of
a
rock
strewn
gully
willie
s
partner
was
long
jim
barnes
who
tried
to
keep
count
stickler
for
rules
how
many
is
that
jim
asked
willie
at
one
stage
of
his
excavation
project
thirteen
said
long
jim
nae
man
said
willie
ye
must
be
countin
the
echoes
he
had
a
palmer
s
dozen
were
honestly
earned
nor
were
there
any
rules
to
save
him
if
there
had
been
he
would
have
found
a
loophole
because
arnold
is
one
golfer
who
knows
the
code
as
thoroughly
as
the
man
who
wrote
the
book
this
knowledge
has
come
in
handy
too
his
first
shot
in
the
open
last
year
landed
in
a
brook
that
flowed
along
the
right
side
of
the
fairway
the
ball
floated
downstream
a
spectator
picked
up
the
ball
and
handed
it
to
a
small
boy
who
dropped
this
suddenly
hot
potato
in
a
very
playable
lie
arnold
sent
for
joe
dey
the
executive
secretary
of
the
golf
association
joe
naturally
ruled
that
a
ball
be
dropped
from
alongside
the
spot
where
it
had
originally
entered
the
stream
i
knew
it
all
along
confessed
arnold
with
a
grin
but
i
just
happened
to
think
how
much
nicer
it
would
be
to
drop
one
way
up
there
for
a
serious
young
man
who
plays
golf
with
a
serious
intensity
palmer
has
such
an
inherent
sense
of
humor
that
it
relieves
the
strain
and
keeps
his
nerves
from
jangling
like
banjo
strings
yet
he
remains
the
fiercest
of
competitors
he
ll
even
bull
head
on
into
the
rules
when
he
is
sure
he
s
right
that
s
how
he
first
won
the
masters
in
it
happened
on
the
twelfth
hole
a
yarder
arnold
s
iron
shot
from
the
tee
burrowed
into
the
bunker
guarding
the
green
an
embankment
that
had
become
soft
and
spongy
from
the
rains
thereby
bringing
local
rules
into
force
ruling
from
on
high
i
can
remove
the
ball
ca
n
t
i
asked
palmer
of
an
official
no
said
the
official
you
must
play
it
where
it
lies
you
re
wrong
said
arnold
a
man
who
knows
the
rules
i
ll
do
as
you
say
but
i
ll
also
play
a
provisional
ball
and
get
a
ruling
he
scored
a
for
the
embedded
ball
a
with
the
provisional
one
the
golfing
fathers
ruled
in
his
favor
so
he
picked
up
a
stroke
with
the
provisional
ball
and
won
the
tournament
by
the
margin
of
that
stroke
until
a
few
weeks
ago
however
arnold
palmer
was
some
god
like
creature
who
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
duffers
but
after
that
at
los
angeles
he
became
one
of
the
boys
a
bigger
hero
than
he
ever
had
been
before
a
formula
to
supply
players
for
the
new
minneapolis
vikings
and
the
problem
of
increasing
the
schedule
to
fourteen
games
will
be
discussed
by
national
football
league
owners
at
a
meeting
at
the
hotel
warwick
today
other
items
on
the
agenda
during
the
meetings
which
are
expected
to
continue
through
saturday
concern
television
rules
changes
professional
football
s
hall
of
fame
players
benefits
and
constitutional
amendments
the
owners
would
like
each
club
in
the
fourteen
team
league
to
play
a
home
and
home
series
with
teams
in
its
division
plus
two
games
against
teams
in
the
other
division
however
this
would
require
a
lengthening
of
the
season
from
thirteen
to
fourteen
weeks
pete
rozelle
the
league
commissioner
pointed
out
we
ll
have
the
problem
of
baseball
at
one
end
and
weather
at
the
other
nine
of
the
league
s
teams
play
in
baseball
parks
and
therefore
face
an
early
season
conflict
in
dates
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
announced
yesterday
it
would
reduce
the
total
amount
of
its
payroll
by
per
cent
through
salary
cuts
and
lay
offs
effective
at
a
m
next
saturday
the
current
monthly
payroll
comes
to
about
howard
e
simpson
the
railroad
s
president
said
a
drastic
decline
in
freight
loading
due
principally
to
the
severe
slump
in
the
movement
of
heavy
goods
has
necessitated
this
regrettable
action
the
reduction
in
expenses
will
affect
employees
in
the
thirteen
states
in
which
the
b
o
operates
salary
cut
and
lay
offs
it
will
be
accomplished
in
two
ways
a
flat
reduction
of
per
cent
in
the
salary
of
all
officers
supervisors
and
other
employees
not
belonging
to
unions
there
are
about
officers
and
employees
in
this
class
sufficient
lay
offs
of
union
employees
to
bring
about
a
per
cent
cut
in
the
union
payroll
expense
since
the
railroad
can
not
reduce
the
salary
of
individual
union
members
under
contract
it
must
accomplish
its
payroll
reduction
by
placing
some
of
the
men
on
furlough
a
b
o
spokesman
said
those
union
members
kept
on
their
jobs
therefore
will
not
take
a
cut
in
their
wages
the
spokesman
said
the
number
to
be
furloughed
can
not
be
estimated
since
the
lay
offs
must
be
carried
out
in
each
area
depending
on
what
men
are
most
needed
on
the
job
a
thug
struck
a

said
annapolis
jan
the
anne
arundel
county
school
superintendent
has
asked
that
the
board
of
education
return
to
the
practice
of
recording
its
proceedings
mechanically
so
that
there
will
be
no
more
question
about
who
said
what
the
proposal
was
made
by
dr
david
s
jenkins
after
he
and
mrs
d
ellwood
williams
jr
a
board
member
and
long
time
critic
of
the
superintendent
argued
for
about
fifteen
minutes
at
this
week
s
meeting
the
disagreement
was
over
what
dr
jenkins
had
said
at
a
previous
session
and
how
his
remarks
appeared
in
the
minutes
presented
at
the
following
meeting
cites
discrepancies
mrs
williams
had
a
list
which
she
said
contained
about
nine
or
ten
discrepancies
between
her
memory
of
dr
jenkins
s
conversation
and
how
they
were
written
up
for
the
board
s
approval
i
hate
to
have
these
things
come
up
again
and
again
dr
jenkins
commented
as
he
made
his
suggestion
these
are
the
board
s
minutes
i
ll
write
what
you
tell
me
to
for
a
number
of
years
the
board
used
a
machine
to
keep
a
permanent
record
but
abandoned
the
practice
about
two
years
ago
it
was
about
that
time
a
board
member
said
later
that
dr
thomas
g
pullen
jr
state
superintendent
of
schools
told
dr
jenkins
and
a
number
of
other
education
officials
that
he
would
not
talk
to
them
with
a
recording
machine
sitting
in
front
of
him
the
board
of
county
commissioners
the
sanitary
commission
the
planning
and
zoning
board
and
other
county
official
bodies
use
recording
machines
for
all
public
business
in
order
to
prevent
law
suits
and
other
misunderstandings
about
what
actually
happened
at
their
meetings
dr
jenkins
notes
however
that
most
of
the
school
boards
in
the
state
do
not
do
so
state
senator
joseph
a
bertorelli
d
first
baltimore
had
a
stroke
yesterday
while
in
his
automobile
in
the
block
of
west
pratt
street
he
was
taken
to
university
hospital
in
a
municipal
ambulance
doctors
at
the
hospital
said
he
was
partially
paralyzed
on
the
right
side
his
condition
was
said
to
be
fair
police
said
he
became
ill
while
parked
in
front
of
a
barber
shop
at
west
pratt
street
barber
summoned
he
called
vincent
l
piraro
proprietor
of
the
shop
who
summoned
police
and
an
ambulance
the
vice
president
of
the
city
council
complained
yesterday
that
there
are
deficiencies
in
the
city
s
snow
clearing
program
which
should
be
corrected
as
soon
as
possible
councilman
william
d
schaefer
d
fifth
said
in
a
letter
to
mayor
grady
that
plowing
and
salting
crews
should
be
dispatched
earlier
in
storms
and
should
be
kept
on
the
job
longer
than
they
were
last
month
werner
criticized
conceding
that
several
cities
to
the
north
were
in
worse
shape
than
baltimore
after
the
last
storm
mr
schaefer
listed
several
improvements
he
said
should
be
made
in
the
snow
plan
here
he
said
the
snow
plan
was
put
in
effect
too
slowly
in
december
equipment
should
be
in
operation
almost
immediately
after
the
first
snowfall
mr
schaefer
said
the
councilman
who
is
the
administration
floor
leader
also
criticized
bernard
l
werner
public
works
director
for
halting
snow
operations
on
tuesday
night
after
the
sunday
storm
sent
home
for
rest
mr
werner
said
yesterday
that
operations
continued
through
the
week
what
he
did
mr
werner
said
was
let
manual
laborers
go
home
tuesday
night
for
some
rest
work
resumed
wednesday
he
said
mr
schaefer
also
recommended
that
the
snow
emergency
route
plan
under
which
parking
is
banned
on
key
streets
and
cars
are
required
to
use
snow
tires
or
chains
on
them
should
be
strictly
enforced
admitting
that
main
streets
and
the
central
business
district
should
have
priority
the
councilman
said
it
is
also
essential
that
small
shopping
areas
not
be
overlooked
if
our
small
merchants
are
to
survive
recounting
personal
observations
of
clearance
work
the
councilman
cited
instances
of
inefficient
use
of
equipment
or
supplies
by
poorly
trained
workers
and

the
fact
that
secrets
of

and
thereby
of
the
american
undersea
fleet
were
involved
in
the
spy
case
had
been
hinted
at
earlier
but
just
before
luncheon
today
the
fact
was
announced
grimly
by
the
british
navy
s
chief
adviser
to
the
cabinet
on
underwater
warfare
capt
george
symonds
he
said
that
drawings
of

details
about
the
ship
were
found
reproduced
in
an
undeveloped
roll
of
film
taken
from
lonsdale
when
he
was
arrested
with
the
two
civil
servants
outside

old
vic
theater
saturday
afternoon
jan
the
information
he
said
would
have
been
of
the
highest
value
to
a
potential
enemy
court
cleared
just
how
many
sub
secrets
were
being
handed
over
when
the
ring
watched
for
six
months
was
broken
remained
untold
the
british
defending
lawyers
who
today
increased
from
three
to
four
demanded
to
know
if
they
could
make
the
information
involved
seem
of
little
value
to
a
jury
the
chances
of
their
clients
would
improve
so
in
the
name
of
justice
the
magistrate
cleared
the
court
of
all
except
officials
to
allow
the
captain
to
elaborate
for
almost
an
hour
almost
any
information
about
the
dreadnought
would
also
reveal
secrets
about
the
american
underwater
fleet
britain
began
designing
the
ship
in
but
got
nowhere
until
the
american
government
decided
to
end
a
ban
on
sharing
military
secrets
with
britain
that
had
been
imposed
after
fuchs
blabbed
the
united
states
offered
to
supply
a
complete
set
of
propelling
equipment
like
that
used
in
the
skipjack
with
the
machinery
went
a
complete
design
for
the
hull
the
skipjack
was
a
second
generation
atomic
sub
much
advanced
on
the
nautilus
and
the
other
four
which
preceded
it
navy
s
future
involved
much
of
the
navy
s
future
depends
upon
her
an
american
naval
announcement
said
on
the
skipjack
s
first
arrival
in
british
waters
in
august
for
exhibition
to
selected
high
officers
at
portland
underwater
research
station
it
was
there
that
the
two
accused
civil
servants
were
at
work
her
basic
hull
form
a
teardrop
and
her
nuclear
power
plant
will
be
used
for
almost
all
new
submarines
including
the
potent
polaris
missile
submarines
the
statement
went
on
the
atom
reactor
water
cooled
was
the
result
of
almost
a
decade
of
research
at
the
naval
reactors
branch
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
and
westinghouse
electric
corp
thru
development
the
reactor
and
its
steam
turbines
had
been
reduced
greatly
in
size
and
also
in
complexity
allowing
a
single
propeller
to
be
used
the
navy
said
the
hull
was
also
a
result
of
almost
a
decade
of
work
it
was
first
tried
out
on
a
conventional
submarine
the
albacore
in
the
skipjack
became
the
fastest
submarine
ever
built
reputedly
it
could
outrun
underwater
the
fastest
destroyers
it
could
reputedly
go
miles
without
refueling
and
stay
down
more
than
a
month
it
was
of
the
hunter
killer
type
designed
to
seek
out
ships
and
other
submarines
with
its
most
advance
gear
and
destroy
them
with
torpedoes
the
navy
captain
disclosed
also
that
a
list
of
questions
found
in
miss
gee
s
purse
would
if
completed
and
handed
back
have
given
the
kremlin
a
complete
picture
of

current
anti

effort

would
have

northern
liberals
are
the
chief
supporters
of
civil
rights
and
of
integration
they
have
also
led
the
nation
in
the
direction
of
a
welfare
state
and
both
in
their
objectives
of
non
discrimination
and
of
social
progress
they
have
had
ranged
against
them
the
southerners
who
are
called
bourbons
the
name
presumably
derives
from
the
french
royal
house
which
never
learned
and
never
forgot
since
bourbon
whiskey
though
of
kentucky
origin
is
at
least
as
much
favored
by
liberals
in
the
north
as
by
conservatives
in
the
south
the
nature
of
the
opposition
between
liberals
and
bourbons
is
too
little
understood
in
the
north
the
race
problem
has
tended
to
obscure
other
less
emotional
issues
which
may
fundamentally
be
even
more
divisive
it
is
these
other
differences
between
north
and
south
other
that
is
than
those
which
concern
discrimination
or
social
welfare
which
i
chiefly
discuss
herein
i
write
about
northern
liberals
from
considerable
personal
experience
a
southerner
married
to
a
new
englander
i
have
lived
for
many
years
in
a
connecticut
commuting
town
with
a
high
percentage
of
artists
writers
publicity
men
and
business
executives
of
egghead
tastes
most
of
them
are
democrats
and
nearly
all
consider
themselves
and
are
viewed
as
liberals
this
is
puzzling
to
an
outsider
conscious
of
the
classic
tradition
of
liberalism
because
it
is
clear
that
these
democrats
who
are
left
of
center
are
at
opposite
poles
from
the
liberal
jefferson
who
held
that
the
best
government
was
the
least
government
yet
paradoxically
my
liberal
friends
continue
to
view
jefferson
as
one
of
their
patron
saints
when
i
question
them
as
to
what
they
mean
by
concepts
like
liberty
and
democracy
i
find
that
they
fall
into
two
categories
the
simpler
ones
who
have
simply
accepted
the
shibboleths
of
their
faith
without
analysis
and
the
intelligent
cynical
ones
who
scornfully
reply
that
these
things
do
n
t
count
any
more
in
the
world
of
to
day
i
am
naive
they
say
to
make
use
of
such
words
i
take
this
to
mean
that
the
intelligent
and
therefore
necessarily
cynical
liberal
considers
that
the
need
for
a
national
economy
with
controls
that
will
assure
his
conception
of
social
justice
is
so
great
that
individual
and
local
liberties
as
well
as
democratic
processes
may
have
to
yield
before
it
this
seems
like
an
attitude
favoring
a
sort
of
totalitarian
bureaucracy
which
under
a
president
of
the
same
stamp
would
try
to
coerce
an
uncooperative
congress
or
supreme
court
as
for
states
rights
they
have
never
counted
in
the
thinking
of
my
liberal
friends
except
as
irritations
of
a
minor
and
immoral
nature
which
exist
now
only
as
anachronisms
the
american
liberal
may
in
the
world
of
to
day
have
a
strong
case
but
he
presents
it
publicly
so
enmeshed
in
hypocrisy
that
it
is
not
an
honest
one
why
in
the
first
place
call
himself
a
liberal
if
he
is
against
laissez
faire
and
favors
an
authoritarian
central
government
with
womb
to
tomb
controls
over
everybody
if
he
attaches
little
importance
to
personal
liberty
why
not
make
this
known
to
the
world
and
if
he
is
so
scornful
of
the
rights
of
states
why
not
advocate
a
different
sort
of
constitution
that
he
could
more
sincerely
support
i
am
concerned
here
however
with
the
northern
liberal
s
attitude
toward
the
south
it
appears
to
be
one
of
intense
dislike
which
he
makes
little
effort
to
conceal
even
in
the
presence
of
southern
friends
his
assumption
seems
to
be
that
any
such
friends
being
tolerable
humans
must
be
more
liberal
than
most
southerners
and
therefore
at
least
partly
in
sympathy
with
his
views
time
s
editor
thomas
griffith
in
his
book
the
waist
high
culture
wrote
most
of
what
was
different
about
it
the
deep
south
i
found
myself
unsympathetic
to
this
for
the
liberals
i
know
would
be
an
understatement
theirs
is
no
mere
lack
of
sympathy
but
something
closer
to
the
passionate
hatred
that
was
directed
against
fascism
i
do
not
think
that
my
experience
would
be
typical
for
southerners
living
in
the
north
in
business
circles
usually
conservative
this
sort
of
atmosphere
would
hardly
be
found
but
in
our
case
and
neither
my
wife
nor
i
have
extreme
views
on
integration
nor
are
we
given
to
emotional
outbursts
the
situation
has
ruined
one
or
two
valued
friendships
and
come
close
to
wrecking
several
more
in
fact
it
has
caused
us
to
give
serious
thought
to
moving
our
residence
south
because
it
is
not
easy
for
the
most
objective
southerner
to
sit
calmly
by
when
his
host
is
telling
a
roomful
of
people
that
the
only
way
to
deal
with
southerners
who
oppose
integration
is
to
send
in
troops
and
shoot
the
bastards
down
accounts
have
been
published
of
northern
liberals
in
the
south
up
against
segregationist
prejudice
especially
in
state
supported
universities
where
pressure
may
be
strong
to
uphold
the
majority
view
but
these
accounts
do
not
show
that
northerners
have
been
subjected
to
embarrassment
or
provocation
by
yankee
hatred
displayed
in
social
gatherings
from
my
wife
s
experience
and
other
sources
this
seems
to
be
rarely
encountered
in
educated
circles
the
strong
feeling
is
certainly
there
but
there
is
a
leavening
of
liberalism
among
college
graduates
throughout
the
south
especially
among
those
who
studied
in
the
north
and
social
relations
arising
out
of
business
ties
impose
courtesy
if
not
sympathy
toward
resident
and
visiting
northerners
also
among
the
latter
a
large
percentage
soon
acquire
the
prevalent
southern
attitude
on
most
social
problems
there
are
of
course
many
souths
but
for
this
discussion
the
most
important
division
is
between
those
who
have
been
reconstructed
and
those
who
have
n
t
my
definition
of
this
much
abused
adjective
is
that
a
reconstructed
rebel
is
one
who
is
glad
that
the
north
won
the
war
nobody
knows
how
many
southerners
there
are
in
this
category
i
suspect
that
there
are
far
more
unreconstructed
ones
than
the
north
likes
to
believe
i
never
heard
of
a
poll
being
taken
on
the
question
no
doubt
such
a
thing
would
be
considered
unpatriotic
prior
to
i
imagine
that
a
majority
of
southerners
would
have
voted
against
the
confederacy
since
the
supreme
court
s
decision
of
that
year
this
is
more
doubtful
and
if
a
poll
had
been
taken
immediately
following
the
dispatch
of
troops
to
little
rock
i
believe
the
majority
would
have
been
for
the
old
south
belief
in
the
traditional
way
of
life
persists
much
more
in
the
older
states
than
in
the
new
ones
probably
a
larger
percentage
of
virginians
and
south
carolinians
remain
unreconstructed
than
elsewhere
with
georgia
north
carolina
and
alabama
following
along
after
them
old
attitudes
are
held
more
tenaciously
in
the
tidewater
than
the
piedmont
so
that
a
line
running
down
the
length
of
the
south
marking
the
upper
limits
of
tidewater
would
roughly
divide
the
old
south
from
the
new
but
with
of
course
important
minority
enclaves
the
long
settled
areas
of
states
like
virginia
and
south
carolina
developed
the
ante
bellum
culture
to
its
richest
flowering
and
there
the
memory
is
more
precious
and
the
consciousness
of
loss
the
greater
also
we
should
not
even
to
day
discount
the
fact
that
a
region
such
as
the
coastal
lowlands
centering
on
charleston
had
closer
ties
with
england
and
the
west
indies
than
with
the
north
even
after
independence
the
social
and
psychological
consequences
of
this
continue
to
affect
the
area
in
certain
respects
defeat
increased
the
persistent
anglophilia
of
the
old
south
poor
where
they
had
once
been
rich
humbled
where
they
had
been
arrogant
having
no
longer
any
hope
of
sharing
in
the
leadership
of
the
nation
the
rebels
who
would
not
surrender
in
spirit
drew
comfort
from
the
sympathy
they
felt
extended
to
them
by
the
mother
country
and
no
doubt
many
people
in
states
like
the
carolinas
and
georgia
which
were
among
the
most
tory
in
sentiment
in
the
eighteenth
century
bitterly
regretted
the
revolt
against
the
crown
among
bourbons
the
racial
issue
may
have
less
to
do
with
their
remaining
unreconstructed
than
other
factors
all
southerners
agree
that
slavery
had
to
go
but
many
historians
maintain
that
except
for
northern
meddling
it
would
have
ended
in
states
like
virginia
years
before
it
did
southern
resentment
has
been
over
the
method
of
its
ending
the
invasion
and
reconstruction
their
fears
now
are
of
miscegenation
and
negro
political
control
in
many
counties
but
apart
from
racial
problems
the
old
unreconstructed
south
to
use
the
moderate
words
favored
by
mr
thomas
griffith
finds
itself
unsympathetic
to
most
of
what
is
different
about
the
civilization
of
the
north
and
this
in
effect
means
most
of
modern
america
it
is
hard
to
see
how
the
situation
could
be
otherwise
and
therein
i
feel
many
northerners
delude
themselves
about
the
south
for
one
thing
this
is
not
a
subject
often
discussed
or
analyzed
there
seems
to
be
almost
a
conspiracy
of
silence
veiling
it
i
suppose
the
reason
is
a
kind
of
wishful
thinking
do
n
t
talk
about
the
final
stages
of
reconstruction
and
they
will
take
care
of
themselves
or
else
the
north
really
believes
that
all
southerners
except
a
few
quaint
old
characters
have
come
around
to
realizing
the
errors
of
their
past
and
are
now
at
heart
sharers
of
the
american
dream
like
everybody
else
if
the
circumstances
are
faced
frankly
it
is
not
reasonable
to
expect
this
to
be
true
the
situation
of
the
south
since
has
been
unique
in
the
western
world
regardless
of
rights
and
wrongs
a
population
and
an
area
appropriate
to
a
pre
world
war
i
great
power
have
been
following
conquest
ruled
against
their
will
by
a
neighboring
people
and
have
had
imposed
upon
them
social
and
economic
controls
they
dislike
and
the
great
majority
of
these
people
are
of
anglo
saxon
or
celtic
descent
this
is
the
only
case
in
modern
history
of
a
people
of
britannic
origin
submitting
without
continued
struggle
to
what
they
view
as
foreign
domination
the
fact
is
due
mainly
to
international
wars
both
hot
and
cold
in
every
war
of
the
united
states
since
the
civil
war
the
south
was
more
belligerent
than
the
rest
of
the
country
so
instead
of
being
tests
of
the
south
s
loyalty
the
spanish
war
the
two
world
wars
and
the
korean
war
all
served
to
overcome
old
grievances
and
cement
reunion
and
there
is
no
section
of
the
nation
more
ardent
than
the
south
in
the
cold
war
against
communism
had
the
situation
been
reversed
had
for
instance
england
been
the
enemy
in
because
of
issues
of
concern
chiefly
to
new
england
there
is
little
doubt
that
large
numbers
of
southerners
would
have
happily
put
on
their
old
confederate
uniforms
to
fight
as
allies
of
britain
it
is
extraordinary
that
a
people
as
proud
and
warlike
as
southerners
should
have
been
as
docile
as
they
have
the
north
should
thank
its
stars
that
such
has
been
the
case
but
at
the
same
time
it
should
not
draw
false
inferences
therefrom
the
two
main
charges
levelled
against
the
bourbons
by
liberals
is
that
they
are
racists
and
social
reactionaries
there
is
much
truth
in
both
these
charges
and
not
many
bourbons
deny
them
whatever
their
faults
they
are
not
hypocrites
most
of
them
sincerely
believe
that
the
anglo
saxon
is
the
best
race
in
the
world
and
that
it
should
remain
pure
many
northeners
believe
this
too
but
few
of
them
will
say
so
publicly
the
bourbon
economic
philosophy
moreover
is
not
very
different
from
that
of
northern
conservatives
but
those
among
the
bourbons
who
remain
unreconstructed
go
much
further
than
this
they
believe
that
if
the
south
had
been
let
alone
it
would
have
produced
a
civilization
superior
to
that
of
modern
america
as
it
is
they
consider
that
the
north
is
now
reaping
the
fruits
of
excess
egalitarianism
that
in
spite
of
its
high
standard
of
living
the
american
way
has
been
proved
inferior
to
the
english
and
scandinavian
ways
although
they
disapprove
of
the
socialistic
features
of
the
latter
the
south
s
antipathy
to
northern
civilization
includes
such
charges
as
poor
manners
harsh
accents
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
arts
of
living
like
gastronomy
and
the
use
of
leisure
their
own
easier
slower
tempo
is
especially
dear
to
southerners
and
i
have
heard
many
say
that
they
are
content
to
earn
a
half
or
a
third
as
much
as
they
could
up
north
because
they
so
much
prefer
the
quieter
habits
of
their
home
town
in
the
past
the
duties
of
the
state
as
sir
henry
maine
noted
long
ago
were
only
two
in
number
internal
order
and
external
security
by
prevailing
over
other
claimants
for
the
loyalties
of
men
the
nation
state
maintained
an
adequate
measure
of
certainty
and
order
within
its
territorial
borders
outside
those
limits
it
asserted
as
against
other
states
a
position
of
sovereign
equality
and
as
against
the
inferior
peoples
of
the
non
western
world
a
position
of
dominance
it
became
the
sole
subject
of
international
law
a
term
which
it
is
pertinent
to
remember
was
coined
by
bentham
a
body
of
legal
principle
which
by
and
large
was
made
up
of
what
western
nations
could
do
in
the
world
arena
that
corpus
of
law
was
a
reflection
of
the
power
system
in
existence
during
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
speaking
generally
it
furthered
and
still
tends
to
further
the
interests
of
the
western
powers
the
enormous
changes
in
world
politics
have
however
thrown
it
into
confusion
so
much
so
that
it
is
safe
to
say
that
all
international
law
is
now
in
need
of
reexamination
and
clarification
in
light
of
the
social
conditions
of
the
present
era
beyond
the
two
basic
tasks
mentioned
above
no
attention
was
paid
by
statesman
or
scholar
to
an
idea
of
state
responsibility
either
internally
or
externally
this
was
particularly
true
in
the
world
arena
which
was
an
anarchical
battleground
characterized
by
strife
and
avaricious
competition
for
colonial
empires
that
any
sort
of
duty
was
owed
by
his
nation
to
other
nations
would
have
astonished
a
nineteenth
century
statesman
his
duty
was
to
his
sovereign
and
to
his
nation
and
an
extension
to
peoples
beyond
the
territorial
boundaries
was
not
to
be
contemplated
thus
to
cite
but
one
example
the
pax
britannica
of
the
nineteenth
century
whether
with
the
british
navy
ruling
the
seas
or
with
the
city
of
london
ruling
world
finance
was
strictly
national
in
motivation
however
much
other
nations
e
g
the
united
states
may
have
incidentally
benefited
at
the
same
time
all
suggestions
that
some
sort
of
societal
responsibility
existed
for
the
welfare
of
the
people
within
the
territorial
state
was
strongly
resisted
social
darwinism
was
able
to
stave
off
the
incipient
socialist
movement
until
well
into
the
present
century
however
in
recent
decades
for
what
doubtless
are
multiple
reasons
an
unannounced
but
nonetheless
readily
observable
shift
has
occurred
in
both
facets
of
national
activity
a
concept
of
responsibility
is
in
process
of
articulation
and
establishment
already
firmly
implanted
internally
it
is
a
growing
factor
in
external
matters
a
little
more
than
twenty
years
ago
the
american
people
turned
an
important
corner
in
what
has
aptly
been
called
a
constitutional
revolution
the
basic
nature
of
government
was
transformed
from
one
essentially
negative
in
nature
the
night
watchman
state
to
one
with
affirmative
duties
to
perform
the
positive
state
came
into
existence
for
lawyers
reflecting
perhaps
their
parochial
preferences
there
has
been
a
special
fascination
since
then
in
the
role
played
by
the
supreme
court
in
that
transformation
the
manner
in
which
its
decisions
altered
in
the
switch
in
time
that
saved
nine
president
roosevelt
s
ill
starred
but
in
effect
victorious
court
packing
plan
the
imprimatur
of
judicial
approval
that
was
finally
placed
upon
social
legislation
of
greater
importance
however
is
the
content
of
those
programs
which
have
had
and
are
having
enormous
consequences
for
the
american
people
labor
relations
have
been
transformed
income
security
has
become
a
standardized
feature
of
political
platforms
and
all
the
many
facets
of
the
american
version
of
the
welfare
state
have
become
part
of
the
conventional
wisdom
a
national
consensus
of
near
unanimity
exists
that
these
governmental
efforts
are
desirable
as
well
as
necessary
ratified
in
the
republican
party
victory
in
the
positive
state
is
now
evidenced
by
political
campaigns
being
waged
not
on
whether
but
on
how
much
social
legislation
there
should
be
the
general
acceptance
of
the
idea
of
governmental
i
e
societal
responsibility
for
the
economic
well
being
of
the
american
people
is
surely
one
of
the
two
most
significant
watersheds
in
american
constitutional
history
the
other
of
course
was
the
civil
war
the
conflict
which
a
century
ago
insured
national
unity
over
fragmentation
a
third
one
of
at
least
equal
and
perhaps
even
greater
importance
is
now
being
traversed
american
immersion
and
involvement
in
world
affairs
internal
national
responsibility
now
a
truism
need
not
be
documented
nevertheless
it
may
be
helpful
to
cite
one
example
that
of
employment
for
as
will
be
shown
below
it
cuts
across
both
facets
of
the
new
concept
thirty
years
ago
while
the
nation
was
wallowing
in
economic
depression
the
prevailing
philosophy
of
government
was
to
stand
aside
and
allow
natural
forces
to
operate
and
cure
the
distress
that
guiding
principle
of
the
hoover
administration
fell
to
the
siege
guns
of
the
new
deal
less
than
a
score
of
years
later
congress
enacted
the
employment
act
of
by
which
the
national
government
assumed
the
responsibility
of
taking
action
to
insure
conditions
of
maximum
employment
hands
off
the
economy
was
replaced
by
conscious
guidance
through
planning
the
economic
side
of
the
constitutional
revolution
in
the
first
important
legislative
victory
of
the
kennedy
administration
came
when
the
principle
of
national
responsibility
for
local
economic
distress
won
out
over
a
state
s
responsibility
proposal
provision
was
made
for
payment
for
unemployment
relief
by
nation
wide
taxation
rather
than
by
a
levy
only
on
those
states
afflicted
with
manpower
surplus
the
american
people
have
indeed
come
a
long
way
in
the
brief
interval
between
and
internal
national
responsibility
is
a
societal
response
to
the
impact
of
the
industrial
revolution
reduced
to
its
simplest
terms
it
is
an
assumption
of
a
collective
duty
to
compensate
for
the
inability
of
individuals
to
cope
with
the
rigors
of
the
era
national
responsibility
for
individual
welfare
is
a
concept
not
limited
to
the
united
states
or
even
to
the
western
nations
a
measure
of
its
widespread
acceptance
may
be
derived
from
a
statement
of
the
international
congress
of
jurists
in
meeting
in
new
delhi
under
the
auspices
of
the
international
commission
of
jurists
a
body
of
lawyers
from
the
free
world
the
congress
redefined
and
expanded
the
traditional
rule
of
law
to
include
affirmative
governmental
duties
it
is
noteworthy
that
the
majority
of
the
delegates
to
the
congress
were
from
the
less
developed
former
colonial
nations
the
rule
of
law
historically
a
principle
according
everyone
his
day
in
court
before
an
impartial
tribunal
was
broadened
substantively
by
making
it
a
responsibility
of
government
to
promote
individual
welfare
recognizing
that
the
rule
of
law
is
a
dynamic
concept
which
should
be
employed
not
only
to
safeguard
the
civil
and
political
rights
of
the
individual
in
a
free
society
the
congress
asserted
that
it
also
included
the
responsibility
to
establish
social
economic
educational
and
cultural
conditions
under
which
his
legitimate
aspirations
and
dignity
may
be
realized
the
idea
of
national
responsibility
thus
has
become
a
common
feature
of
the
nations
of
the
non
soviet
world
for
better
or
for
worse
we
all
now
live
in
welfare
states
the
organizing
principle
of
which
is
collective
responsibility
for
individual
well
being
whether
a
concept
analogous
to
the
principle
of
internal
responsibility
operates
in
a
nation
s
external
relations
is
less
obvious
and
more
difficult
to
establish
the
hypothesis
ventured
here
is
that
it
does
and
that
evidence
is
accumulating
validating
that
proposition
the
content
is
not
the
same
however
rather
than
individual
security
it
is
the
security
and
continuing
existence
of
an
ideological
group
those
in
the
free
world
that
is
basic
external
national
responsibility
involves
a
burgeoning
requirement
that
the
leaders
of
the
western
nations
so
guide
their
decisions
as
to
further
the
viability
of
other
friendly
nations
if
internal
responsibility
suggests
acceptance
of
the
socialist
ideal
of
equality
then
external
responsibility
implies
adherence
to
principles
of
ideological
supranationalism
reference
to
two
other
concepts
nationalism
and
sovereignty
may
help
to
reveal
the
contours
of
the
new
principle
in
its
beginnings
the
nation
state
had
to
struggle
to
assert
itself
internally
against
feudal
groups
and
externally
against
the
power
and
influence
of
such
other
claimants
for
loyalty
as
the
church
the
breakup
of
the
holy
roman
empire
and
the
downfall
of
feudalism
led
not
more
than
two
centuries
ago
to
the
surge
of
nationalism
since
the
time
span
of
the
nation
state
coincides
roughly
with
the
separate
existence
of
the
united
states
as
an
independent
entity
it
is
perhaps
natural
for
americans
to
think
of
the
nation
as
representative
of
the
highest
form
of
order
something
permanent
and
unchanging
the
concept
of
nationalism
is
the
political
principle
that
epitomizes
and
glorifies
the
territorial
state
as
the
characteristic
type
of
socal
structure
but
it
is
more
than
that
for
it
includes
the
emotional
ties
that
bind
men
to
their
homeland
and
the
complex
motivations
that
hold
a
large
group
of
people
together
as
a
unit
today
as
new
nations
rise
from
the
former
colonial
empires
nationalism
is
one
of
the
hurricane
forces
loose
in
the
world
almost
febrile
in
intensity
the
principle
has
become
worldwide
in
application
unfortunately
at
the
very
time
that
nationalist
fervors
can
wreak
greatest
harm
historically
however
the
concept
is
one
that
has
been
of
marked
benefit
to
the
people
of
the
western
civilizational
group
by
subduing
disparate
lesser
groups
the
nation
has
to
some
degree
at
least
broadened
the
capacity
for
individual
liberty
within
their
confines
moreover
technological
and
industrial
growth
has
proceeded
at
an
accelerated
pace
thus
increasing
the
cornucopia
from
which
material
wants
can
be
satisfied
while
the
pattern
is
uneven
some
having
gained
more
than
others
nationalism
has
in
fact
served
the
western
peoples
well
whether
historical
nationalism
helped
the
peoples
of
the
remainder
of
the
world
and
whether
today
s
nationalism
in
the
former
colonial
areas
has
equally
beneficial
aspects
are
other
questions
it
is
one
of
the
ironic
quirks
of
history
that
the
viability
and
usefulness
of
nationalism
and
the
territorial
state
are
rapidly
dissipating
at
precisely
the
time
that
the
nation
state
attained
its
highest
number
approximately
but
it
is
more
than
irony
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
nationalism
is
no
longer
a
tenable
concept
is
because
it
has
spread
throughout
the
planet
in
other
words
nationalism
worked
well
enough
when
it
had
limited
application
both
as
to
geography
and
as
to
population
it
becomes
a
perilous
anachronism
when
adopted
on
a
world
wide
basis
complementing
the
political
principle
of
nationalism
is
the
legal
principle
of
sovereignty
the
former
receives
its
legitimacy
from
the
latter
operating
side
by
side
together
they
helped
shore
up
the
nation
state
while
sovereignty
has
roots
in
antiquity
in
its
present
usage
it
is
essentially
modern
jean
bodin
writing
in
the
sixteenth
century
may
have
been
the
seminal
thinker
but
it
was
the
vastly
influential
john
austin
who
set
out
the
main
lines
of
the
concept
as
now
understood
austin
s
nineteenth
century
view
of
law
and
sovereignty
still
dominates
much
of
today
s
legal
and
political
thinking
to
him
law
is
the
command
of
the
sovereign
the
english
monarch
who
personifies
the
power
of
the
nation
while
sovereignty
is
the
power
to
make
law
i
e
to
prevail
over
internal
groups
and
to
be
free
from
the
commands
of
other
sovereigns
in
other
nations
these
fundamental
ideas
the
indivisibility
of
sovereignty
and
its
dual
internal
external
aspects
still
remain
the
core
of
that
concept
of
ultimate
political
power
the
nation
state
then
exemplifies
the
principle
of
nationalism
and
exercises
sovereignty
supreme
power
over
domestic
affairs
and
independence
from
outside
control
in
fact
however
both
principles
have
always
been
nebulous
and
loosely
defined
high
level
abstractions
are
always
difficult
to
pin
down
with
precision
that
is
particularly
true
of
sovereignty
when
it
is
applied
to
democratic
societies
in
which
popular
sovereignty
is
said
to
exist
and
in
federal
nations
in
which
the
jobs
of
government
are
split
nevertheless
nationalism
and
sovereignty
are
reputed
in
the
accepted
wisdom
to
describe
the
modern
world
is
there
a
different
reality
behind
the
facade
does
the
surface
hide
a
quite
different
picture
the
short
answer
to
those
questions
is
yes
both
concepts
are
undergoing
alteration
to
some
degree
they
are
being
supplanted
by
a
concept
of
national
responsibility
as
evidence
to
support
that
view
consider
the
following
illustrative
instances
can
thermonuclear
war
be
set
off
by
accident
what
steps
have
been
taken
to
guard
against
the
one
sort
of
mishap
that
could
trigger
the
destruction
of
continents
are
we
as
safe
as
we
should
be
from
such
a
disaster
is
anything
being
done
to
increase
our
margin
of
safety
will
the
danger
increase
or
decrease
i
have
just
asked
these
questions
in
the
pentagon
in
the
white
house
in
offices
of
key
scientists
across
the
country
and
aboard
the
submarines
that
prowl
for
months
underwater
with
neat
rows
of
green
launch
tubes
which
contain
polaris
missiles
and
which
are
affectionately
known
as
sherwood
forest
i
asked
the
same
questions
inside
the
launch
control
rooms
of
an
atlas
missile
base
in
wyoming
where
officers
who
wear
sidearms
are
manning
the
commit
buttons
that
could
start
a
war
accidentally
or
by
design
and
in
the
command
centers
where
other
pistol
packing
men
could
give
orders
to
push
such
buttons
to
the
men
in
the
instrument
jammed
bomber
cockpits
submarine
compartments
and
the
antiseptic
windowless
rooms
that
would
be
the
foxholes
of
tomorrow
s
impersonal
intercontinental
wars
the
questions
seem
farfetched
there
is
unceasing
pressure
but
its
sources
are
immediate
readiness
exercises
are
almost
continuous
each
could
be
the
real
thing
in
the
command
centers
there
are
special
clocks
ready
to
tick
off
the
minutes
elapsed
since
e
hour
e
stands
for
execution
the
moment
a
go
order
would
unleash
an
american
nuclear
strike
there
is
little
time
for
the
men
in
the
command
centers
to
reflect
about
the
implications
of
these
clocks
they
are
preoccupied
riding
herd
on
control
panels
switches
flashing
colored
lights
on
pale
green
or
gray
consoles
that
look
like
business
machines
they
know
little
about
their
machinery
beyond
mechanical
details
accidental
war
is
so
sensitive
a
subject
that
most
of
the
people
who
could
become
directly
involved
in
one
are
told
just
enough
so
they
can
perform
their
portions
of
incredibly
complex
tasks
among
the
policy
makers
generals
physicists
psychologists
and
others
charged
with
controlling
the
actions
of
the
button
pushers
and
their
hardware
the
answers
to
my
questions
varied
partly
according
to
a
man
s
flair
for
what
the
professionals
in
this
field
call
scenarios
as
an
air
force
psychiatrist
put
it
you
ca
n
t
have
dry
runs
on
this
one
the
experts
are
thus
forced
to
hypothesize
sequences
of
events
that
have
never
occurred
probably
never
will
but
possibly
might
only
one
rule
prevailed
in
my
conversations
with
these
men
the
more
highly
placed
they
are
that
is
the
more
they
know
the
more
concerned
they
have
become
already
accidental
war
is
a
silent
guest
at
the
discussions
within
the
kennedy
administration
about
the
urgency
of
disarmament
and
nearly
all
other
questions
of
national
security
only
recently
new
holes
were
discovered
in
our
safety
measures
and
a
search
is
now
on
for
more
work
is
under
way
to
see
whether
new
restraining
devices
should
be
installed
on
all
nuclear
weapons
meanwhile
the
experts
speak
of
wars
triggered
by
false
pre
emption
escalation
unauthorized
behavior
and
other
terms
that
will
be
discussed
in
this
report
they
inhabit
a
secret
world
centered
on
go
codes
and
gold
phones
their
conversations
were
almost
invariably
accompanied
by
the
same
gestures
arms
and
pointed
forefingers
darting
toward
each
other
in
arclike
semicircular
motions
one
arm
represented
our
bombers
and
missiles
the
other
arm
theirs
yet
implicit
in
each
movement
was
the
death
of
millions
perhaps
hundreds
of
millions
perhaps
you
and
me
and
the
experts
these
men
are
not
callous
it
is
their
job
to
think
about
the
unthinkable
unanimously
they
believe
that
the
world
would
become
a
safer
place
if
more
of
us
and
more
russians
and
communist
chinese
too
thought
about
accidental
war
the
first
systematic
thinking
about
this
pandora

box
within

was
done
four
years

by

his

made
him
the
paul
revere
of

and

procedures
were
enormously
increased
in
recent
weeks
as
a
result
of
a
sweeping
defense
policy
reappraisal
by
the
kennedy
administration
basic

strategy
has
been
modified
and
large
new
sums
allocated
to
meet

and
to

it
as

as

only

the

he

momentous

clobber
the

what
if
the

himself
in
the
language
of
the
military
goes
ape
or
singlehandedly
decided
to
reverse
national
policy
and
hit
the
soviets
without
provocation
nobody
can
be
absolutely
certain
of
the
answers
however
the
system
is
designed
ingeniously
and
hopefully
so
that
no
one
man
could
initiate
a
thermonuclear

even
the

can
not
pick
up

give

all

the

vital

let

at

and
see
what
must
still
happen
before
a

in

plenty
the

almost

all
full

mans
the

post
twenty
four

a

it
is

nine

twenty
one

high
movable

are
crammed
with

and
bill
wisman
forty

a
farmer
s
son
from
beallsville
ohio
is
a
quiet
but
impressive
man
his
eyes
are
steady

of
the
deepest
brown
his
movements
and
speech
are
precise
clear
and
quick
no
question
ruffles

wisman
who

for
four
years
calls
the

for
a

operating
three
rows
of

at

a

is

the

or
his

and
their

would
occupy
a
balcony
that
stretches
across
the
length
of
the
room
above
wisman
and
his
staff
at
general
power
s
seat
in
the
balcony
there
is
also
a
gold
phone
general
power
would
participate
in
the
decision
making
wisman
below
would
listen
in
and
act
his
consoles
can
give
him
instant
contact
with
more
than
seventy
bases
around
the
world
and
with
every
sac
aircraft
he
need
only
pick
up
one
of
the
two
red
telephone
receivers
at
his
extreme
left
right
next
to
the
big
red
button
marked
alert
there
are
two
receivers
in
case
one
should
be
dropped
and
damaged
but
wisman
too
does
not
know
the
go
code
he
must
take
it
from
the
red
box
in
point
of
fact
this
is
a
beige
box
with
a
bright
red
door
about
one
and
a
half
feet
square
and
hung
from
the
wall
about
six
feet
from
the
door
to
wisman
s
right
the
box
is
internally
wired
so
the
door
can
never
be
opened
without
setting
off
a
screeching
klaxon
it
s
real
obnoxious
now
we
must
become
vague
for
we
are
approaching
one
of
the
nation
s
most
guarded
secrets
the
codes
in
the
red
box
there
are
several
of
them
covering
various
contingencies
are
contained
in
a
sealed
x
ray
proof
unique
device
they
are
supplied
a
batch
at
a
time
by
a
secret
source
and
are
continually
changed
by
wisman
or
his
staff
at
random
intervals
but
even
the
contents
of
wisman
s
box
can
not
start
a
war
they
are
mere
fragments
just
one
portion
of
preprepared
messages
what
these
fragments
are
and
how
they
activate
the
go
order
may
not
be
revealed
the
pieces
must
be
placed
in
the
context
of
the
prepared
messages
by
wisman
s
staff
in
addition
to
the
authentication
and
acknowledgment
procedures
which
precede
and
follow
the
sending
of
the
go
messages
again
in
special
codes
each
message
also
contains
an
internal
authenticator
another
specific
signal
to
convince
the
recipient
that
he
is
getting
the
real
thing
i
asked
wisman
what
would
happen
if
he
broke
out
the
go
codes
and
tried
to
start
transmitting
one
i
d
wind
up
full
of
bullet
holes
he
said
and
there
was
no
question
that
he
was
talking
about
bullets
fired
by
his
coworkers
now
let
us
imagine
a
wing
of
b
s
on
alert
near
their
positive
control
or
fail
safe
points
the
spots
on
the
map
many
miles
from
soviet
territory
beyond
which
they
are
forbidden
to
fly
without
specific
orders
to
proceed
to
their
targets
they
too
have
fragments
of
the
go
code
with
them
as
wisman
put
it
they
have
separate
pieces
of
the
pie
and
we
have
the
whole
pie
once
we
send
out
the
whole
pie
they
can
put
their
pieces
into
it
unless
we
send
out
the
whole
pie
their
pieces
mean
nothing
why
does
wisman
s
ever
changing
code
always
mesh
with
the
fragments
in
possession
of
the
button
pushers
the
answer
is
a
cryptographic
secret
at
any
rate
three
men
out
of
a
six
man
b
crew
are
required
to
copy
down
wisman
s
go
to
war
message
each
must
match
wisman
s
pie
with
the
fragment
that
he
carries
with
him
all
three
must
compare
notes
and
agree
to
go
after
that
it
requires
several
minutes
of
concentrated
work
including
six
separate
and
deliberate
actions
by
a
minimum
of
three
men
sitting
at
three
separate
stations
in
a
bomber
each
with
another
man
beside
him
to
help
for
an
armed
bomb
to
be
released
unless
all
gadgets
are
properly
operated
and
the
wires
and
seals
from
the
handles
removed
first
no
damage
can
be
done
suddenly
however
their
posture
changed
and
the
game
ended
they
went
as
rigid
as
black
statuary
six
figures
lean
and
tall
and
angular
went
still
their
heads
were
in
the
air
sniffing
they
all
swung
at
the
same
instant
in
the
same
direction
they
saw
it
before
i
did
even
with
my
binoculars
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
tiny
distant
rain
squall
a
dull
gray
sheet
which
reached
from
a
layer
of
clouds
to
the
earth
in
the
degrees
of
horizon
it
obscured
only
a
degree
no
more
a
white
man
would
not
have
seen
it
the
aborigines
fastened
upon
it
with
a
concentration
beyond
pathos
watching
they
waited
until
the
squall
thickened
and
began
to
move
in
a
long
drifting
slant
across
the
dry
burning
land
at
once
the
whole
band
set
off
at
a
lope
they
were
chasing
a
rain
cloud
they
went
after
the
squall
as
mercilessly
as
a
wolf
pack
after
an
abandoned
cow
i
followed
them
in
the
jeep
and
now
they
did
not
care
the
games
were
over
this
was
life
occasionally
for
no
reason
that
i
could
see
they
would
suddenly
alter
the
angle
of
their
trot
sometimes
i
guessed
it
was
because
the
rain
squall
had
changed
direction
sometimes
it
was
to
skirt
a
gulley
their
gait
is
impossible
to
convey
in
words
it
has
nothing
of
the
proud
stride
of
the
trained
runner
about
it
it
is
not
a
lope
it
is
not
done
with
style
or
verve
it
is
the
gait
of
the
human
who
must
run
to
live
arms
dangling
legs
barely
swinging
over
the
ground
head
hung
down
and
only
occasionally
swinging
up
to
see
the
target
a
loose
motion
that
is
just
short
of
stumbling
and
yet
is
wonderfully
graceful
it
is
a
barely
controlled
skimming
of
the
ground
they
ran
for
three
hours
finally
avoiding
hummocks
and
seeking
low
ground
they
intercepted
the
rain
squall
for
ten
minutes
they
ran
beneath
the
squall
raising
their
arms
and
for
the
first
time
shouting
and
capering
then
the
wind
died
and
the
rain
squall
held
steady
they
were
studying
the
ground
suddenly
one
of
them
shouted
ran
a
few
feet
bent
forward
and
put
his
mouth
to
the
ground
he
had
found
a
depression
with
rain
water
in
it
he
bent
down
a
black
cranelike
figure
and
put
his
mouth
to
the
ground
with
a
lordly
and
generous
gesture
the
discoverer
stood
up
and
beckoned
to
the
closest
of
his
fellows
the
other
trotted
over
and
swooped
at
the
tiny
puddle
in
an
instant
he
had
sucked
it
dry
the
aborigine
lives
on
the
cruelest
land
i
have
ever
seen
which
does
not
mean
that
it
is
ugly
part
of
it
is
of
course
there
are
thousands
of
square
miles
of
salt
pan
which
are
hideous
they
are
huge
areas
which
have
been
swept
by
winds
for
so
many
centuries
that
there
is
no
soil
left
but
only
deep
bare
ridges
fifty
or
sixty
yards
apart
with
ravines
between
them
thirty
or
forty
feet
deep
and
the
only
thing
that
moves
is
a
scuttling
layer
of
sand
such
stretches
have
an
inhuman
moonlike
quality
but
much
of
the
land
which
the
aborigine
wanders
looks
as
if
it
should
be
hospitable
it
is
softened
by
the
saltbush
and
the
bluebush
has
a
peaceful
quality
the
hills
roll
softly
the
malignancy
of
such
a
landscape
has
been
beautifully
described
by
the
australian
charles
bean
he
tells
of
three
men
who
started
out
on
a
trip
across
a
single
paddock
a
ten
by
ten
mile
square
owned
by
a
sheep
grazer
they
went
well
equipped
with
everything
except
knowledge
of
the
outback
country
the
countryside
looked
like
a
beautiful
open
park
with
gentle
slopes
and
soft
gray
tree
clumps
nothing
appalling
or
horrible
rushed
upon
these
men
only
there
happened
nothing
there
might
have
been
a
pool
of
cool
water
behind
any
of
these
tree
clumps
only
there
was
not
it
might
have
rained
any
time
only
it
did
not
there
might
have
been
a
fence
or
a
house
just
over
the
next
rise
only
there
was
not
they
lay
with
the
birds
hopping
from
branch
to
branch
above
them
and
the
bright
sky
peeping
down
at
them
no
one
came
the
white
men
died
and
countless
others
like
them
have
died
even
today
range
riders
will
come
upon
mummified
bodies
of
men
who
attempted
nothing
more
difficult
than
a
twenty
mile
hike
and
slowly
lost
direction
were
tortured
by
the
heat
driven
mad
by
the
constant
and
unfulfilled
promise
of
the
landscape
and
who
finally
died
the
aborigine
is
not
deceived
he
knows
that
the
land
is
hard
and
pitiless
he
knows
that
the
economy
of
life
in
the
outback
is
awful
there
is
no
room
for
error
or
waste
any
organism
that
falters
or
misperceives
the
signals
or
weakens
is
done
i
do
not
know
if
such
a
way
of
life
can
come
to
be
a
self
conscious
challenge
but
i
suspect
that
it
can
perhaps
this
is
what
gives
the
aborigine
his
odd
air
of
dignity
the
family
at
the
boulder
seeing
an
aborigine
today
is
a
difficult
thing
many
of
them
have
drifted
into
the
cities
and
towns
and
seaports
others
are
confined
to
vast
reservations
and
not
only
does
the
australian
government
justifiably
not
wish
them
to
be
viewed
as
exhibits
in
a
zoo
but
on
their
reservations
they
are
extremely
fugitive
shunning
camps
coming
together
only
for
corroborees
at
which
their
strange
culture
comes
to
its
highest
pitch
which
is
very
low
indeed
i
persuaded
an
australian
friend
who
had
lived
outback
for
years
to
take
me
to
see
some
aborigines
living
in
the
bush
it
was
a
difficult
and
ambiguous
kind
of
negotiation
even
though
the
rancher
was
said
to
be
expert
in
his
knowledge
of
the
aborigines
and
their
language
finally
however
the
arrangements
were
made
and
we
drove
out
into
the
bush
in
a
land
rover
we
followed
the
asphalt
road
for
a
few
miles
and
then
swung
off
onto
a
smaller
road
which
was
nothing
more
than
two
tire
marks
on
the
earth
the
rancher
went
a
mile
down
this
road
and
then
when
he
reached
a
big
red
boulder
swung
off
the
road
at
once
he
started
to
glance
toward
the
instrument
panel
it
took
me
a
moment
to
realize
what
was
odd
about
that
panel
there
was
a
gimbaled
compass
welded
to
it
which
rocked
gently
back
and
forth
as
the
land
rover
bounced
about
the
rancher
was
navigating
his
way
across
the
flatland
do
you
always
navigate
like
this
i
asked
damned
right
he
said
once
i
get
out
on
the
flat
i
do
some
chaps
that
know
an
area
well
can
make
their
way
by
landmarks
a
tree
here
a
wash
here
a
boulder
there
but
if
you
do
n
t
know
the
place
like
the
palm
of
your
hand
you
d
better
use
a
compass
and
the
speedometer
two
miles
northeast
then
five
miles
southwest
that
sort
of
thing
very
simple
he
was
right
the
landscape
kept
repeating
itself
i
would
try
to
memorize
landmarks
and
saw
in
a
half
hour
that
it
was
hopeless
finally
we
approached
the
bivouac
of
the
aborigines
they
were
camped
beside
a
large
column
shaped
boulder
a
man
his
lubra
and
two
children
the
sun
was
not
yet
high
and
all
of
them
were
in
the
small
area
of
shade
cast
by
the
boulder
there
was
also
a
dog
a
dingo
dog
its
ribs
showed
it
was
a
yellow
nondescript
color
it
suffered
from
a
variety
of
sores
hair
had
scabbed
off
its
body
in
patches
it
lay
with
its
head
on
its
paws
and
only
its
eyes
moving
watching
us
carefully
it
struck
me
as
a
very
bright
and
very
malnourished
dog
no
one
patted
the
dog
it
was
not
a
pet
it
was
a
worker
the
buggers
love
shade
the
rancher
said
i
suppose
because
it
saves
them
some
loss
of
body
water
they
ll
move
around
that
rock
all
day
following
the
shade
during
the
hottest
part
of
the
day
of
course
the
sun
comes
straight
down
and
there
is
n
t
any
shade
we
drove
close
to
the
boulder
stopped
the
land
rover
and
walked
over
toward
the
family
the
man
was
leaning
against
the
rock
he
gazed
away
from
us
as
we
approached
he
was
over
six
feet
tall
and
very
thin
his
legs
were
narrow
and
very
long
every
bone
and
muscle
in
his
body
showed
but
he
did
not
give
the
appearance
of
starving
he
had
long
black
hair
and
a
wispy
beard
the
ridges
over
his
eyes
were
huge
and
his
eyelids
were
half
shut
there
was
something
about
his
face
that
disturbed
me
and
it
took
several
seconds
to
realize
what
it
was
not
merely
that
flies
were
crawling
over
his
face
but
his
narrowed
eyelids
did
not
blink
when
the
flies
crawled
into
his
eye
sockets
a
fly
would
crawl
down
the
bulging
forehead
into
the
socket
of
the
eye
walk
along
the
man
s
lashes
and
across
the
wet
surface
of
the
eyeball
and
the
eye
did
not
blink
the
australian
and
i
both
were
wearing
insect
repellent
and
were
not
badly
bothered
by
insects
but
my
eyes
watered
as
we
stood
watching
the
aborigine
i
turned
to
look
at
the
lubra
she
remained
squatting
on
her
heels
all
the
time
we
were
there
like
the
man
she
was
entirely
naked
her
long
thin
arms
moved
in
a
slow
rhythmical
gesture
over
the
family
possessions
which
were
placed
in
front
of
her
there
were
two
rubbing
sticks
for
making
fire
two
stones
shaped
roughly
like
knives
a
woven
root
container
which
held
a
few
pounds
of
dried
worms
and
the
dead
body
of
some
rodent
there
was
also
a
long
wooden
spear
and
a
woomera
a
spear
throwing
device
which
gives
the
spear
an
enormous
velocity
and
high
accuracy
there
was
also
a
boomerang
elaborately
carved
everything
was
burnished
with
sweat
and
grease
so
that
all
of
the
objects
seemed
to
have
been
carved
from
the
same
material
and
to
be
ageless
the
two
children
both
boys
wandered
around
the
australian
and
me
for
a
few
moments
and
then
returned
to
their
work
they
squatted
on
their
heels
with
their
heads
bent
far
forward
their
eyes
only
a
few
inches
from
the
ground
they
had
located
the
runway
of
a
colony
of
ants
and
as
the
ants
came
out
of
the
ground
the
boys
picked
them
up
one
at
a
time
and
pinched
them
dead
the
tiny
bodies
dropped
onto
a
dry
leaf
made
a
pile
as
big
as
a
small
apple
the
odor
here
was
more
powerful
than
that
which
surrounded
the
town
aborigines
the
smell
at
first
was
more
surprising
than
unpleasant
it
was
also
subtly
familiar
for
it
was
the
odor
of
the
human
body
but
multiplied
innumerable
times
because
of
the
fact
that
the
aborigines
never
bathed
one
s
impulse
is
to
say
that
the
smell
was
a
stink
and
unpleasant
but
that
is
a
cliche
and
a
dishonest
one
the
smell
is
sexual
but
so
powerfully
so
that
a
civilized
nose
must
deny
it
their
skin
was
covered
with
a
thin
coating
of
sweat
and
dirt
which
had
almost
the
consistency
of
a
second
skin
they
roll
at
night
in
ashes
to
keep
warm
and
their
second
skin
has
a
light
dusty
cast
to
it
in
spots
such
as
the
elbows
and
knees
the
second
skin
is
worn
off
and
i
realized
the
aborigines
were
much
darker
than
they
appeared
as
if
the
coating
of
sweat
dirt
and
ashes
were
a
cosmetic
the
boys
had
beautiful
dark
eyes
and
unlike
their
father
they
brushed
constantly
at
the
flies
and
blinked
their
eyes
that
smell
is
something
eh
mate
the
australian
asked
they
swear
that
every
person
smells
different
and
every
family
smells
different
from
every
other
at
the
corroborees
when
they
get
to
dancing
and
sweating
you
ll
see
them
rubbing
up
against
a
man
who
s
supposed
to
have
a
specially
good
smell
idje
here
and
he
nodded
at
the
man
is
said
to
have
great
odor
the
stink
is
all
the
same
to
me
but
i
really
think
they
can
make
one
another
out
blindfolded
here
idje
you
fella
like
tabac
he
said
sharply
idje
still
stared
over
our
shoulders
at
the
horizon
the
australian
stopped
trying
to
talk
a
pidgin
i
could
understand
and
spoke
strange
words
from
deep
in
his
chest
it
was
a
fortunate
time
in
which
to
build
for
the
seventeenth
century
was
a
great
period
in
persian
art
the
architects
the
tile
and
carpet
makers
the
potters
painters
calligraphers
and
metalsmiths
worked
through
abbas
s
reign
and
those
of
his
successors
to
enrich
the
city
travelers
entering
from
the
desert
were
confounded
by
what
must
have
seemed
an
illusion
a
great
garden
filled
with
nightingales
and
roses
cut
by
canals
and
terraced
promenades
studded
with
water
tanks
of
turquoise
tile
in
which
were
reflected
the
glistening
blue
curves
of
a
hundred
domes
at
the
heart
of
all
of
this
was
the
square
which
one
such
traveler
declared
to
be
as
spacious
as
pleasant
and
aromatick
a
market
as
any
in
the
universe
in
time
isfahan
came
to
be
known
as
half
the
world
isfahan
nisf
i
jahan
in
the
early
eighteenth
century
this
fantastic
city
then
the
size
of
london
started
to
decline
the
afghans
invaded
the
safavids
fell
from
power
the
capital
went
elsewhere
the
desert
encroached
isfahan
became
more
of
a
legend
than
a
place
and
now
it
is
for
many
people
simply
a
name
to
which
they
attach
their
notions
of
old
persia
and
sometimes
of
the
east
they
think
of
it
as
a
kind
of
spooky
museum
in
which
they
may
half
see
and
half
imagine
the
old
splendor
those
who
actually
get
there
find
that
it
is
n
t
spooky
at
all
but
as
brilliant
as
a
tile
in
sunlight
but
even
for
them
it
remains
a
museum
or
perhaps
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say
a
tomb
a
tomb
in
which
persia
lies
well
preserved
but
indeed
dead
everyone
is
ready
to
grant
the
persians
their
history
but
almost
no
one
is
willing
to
acknowledge
their
present
it
seems
that
for
persia
and
especially
for
this
city
there
are
only
two
times
the
glorious
past
and
the
corrupt
depressing
sterile
present
the
one
apparent
connection
between
the
two
is
a
score
of
buildings
which
somehow
or
other
have
survived
and
which
naturally
enough
are
called
historical
monuments
however
just
as
all
the
buildings
have
not
fallen
and
flowed
back
to
their
original
mud
so
the
values
which
wanted
them
and
saw
that
they
were
built
have
not
all
disappeared
the
values
and
talents
which
made
the
tile
and
the
dome
the
rug
the
poem
and
the
miniature
continue
in
certain
social
institutions
which
rise
above
the
ordinary
life
of
this
city
as
the
great
buildings
rise
above
blank
walls
and
dirty
lanes
often
too
the
social
institutions
are
housed
in
these
pavilions
and
palaces
and
bridges
for
these
great
structures
are
not
simply
historical
monuments
they
are
the
places
where
persians
live
the
promenade
for
example
continues
to
take
place
on
the
chahar
bagh
a
mile
long
garden
of
plane
and
poplar
trees
that
now
serves
as
the
city
s
principal
street
it
takes
place
as
well
along
the
terraces
and
through
the
arcades
of
the
khaju
bridge
and
also
in
the
gardens
of
the
square
on
fridays
the
day
when
many
persians
relax
with
poetry
talk
and
a
samovar
people
do
not
it
is
true
stream
into
chehel
sotun
a
pavilion
and
garden
built
by
shah
abbas
ii
in
the
seventeenth
century
but
they
do
retire
into
hundreds
of
pavilions
throughout
the
city
and
up
the
river
valley
which
are
smaller
more
humble
copies
of
the
former
and
of
course
religious
life
continues
to
center
in
the
more
famous
mosques
and
commercial
life
very
much
a
social
institution
in
the
bazaar
those
three
other
great
activities
of
the
persians
the
bath
the
teahouse
and
the
zur
khaneh
the
latter
a
kind
of
club
in
which
a
leader
and
a
group
of
men
in
an
octagonal
pit
move
through
a
rite
of
calisthenics
dance
chanted
poetry
and
music
do
not
take
place
in
buildings
to
which
entrance
tickets
are
sold
but
some
of
them
occupy
splendid
examples
of
persian
domestic
architecture
long
domed
chalk
white
rooms
with
daises
of
turquoise
tile
their
end
walls
cut
through
to
the
orchards
and
the
sky
by
open
arches
but
more
important
and
the
thing
which
the
casual
traveler
and
the
blind
sojourner
often
do
not
see
is
that
these
places
and
activities
are
often
the
settings
in
which
persians
exercise
their
extraordinary
aesthetic
sensibilities
water
air
fruit
poetry
music
the
human
form
these
things
are
important
to
persians
and
they
experience
them
with
an
intense
and
discriminating
awareness
i
should
like
by
the
way
to
make
it
clear
that
i
am
not
using
the
word
persians
carelessly
i
do
n
t
mean
a
few
aesthetes
who
play
about
with
sensations
like
a
young
prince
in
a
miniature
dabbling
his
hand
in
a
pool
these
things
are
important
to
almost
all
persians
and
perhaps
most
important
to
the
most
ordinary
the
men
crying
love
poems
in
an
orchard
on
any
summer
s
night
are
as
often
as
not
the
lutihaw
mustachioed
toughs
who
spend
most
of
their
lives
in
and
out
of
the
local
prisons
brothels
and
teahouses
a
few
months
ago
it
was
a
fairly
typical
landlord
who
in
the
dead
of
night
lugged
me
up
a
mountainside
to
drink
from
a
spring
famous
in
the
neighborhood
for
its
clarity
and
flavor
not
long
ago
an
acquaintance
a
slick
headed
water
rat
of
a
lad
up
from
the
maw
of
the
city
stood
on
the
balcony
puffing
his
first
cigarette
in
weeks
the
air
he
said
was
just
right
a
cigarette
would
taste
particularly
good
i
really
did
n
t
know
what
he
meant
it
was
a
nice
day
granted
but
he
knew
he
sniffed
the
air
and
licked
it
on
his
lip
and
knew
as
a
vintner
knows
a
vintage
the
natural
world
then
plus
poetry
and
some
kinds
of
art
receives
from
the
most
ordinary
of
persians
a
great
deal
of
attention
the
line
of
an
eyebrow
the
color
of
the
skin
a
ghazal
from
hafiz
the
purity
of
spring
water
the
long
afternoon
among
the
boughs
which
crowd
the
upper
story
of
a
pavilion
these
things
are
noticed
judged
and
valued
nowhere
in
isfahan
is
this
rich
aesthetic
life
of
the
persians
shown
so
well
as
during
the
promenade
at
the
khaju
bridge
there
has
probably
always
been
a
bridge
of
some
sort
at
the
southeastern
corner
of
the
city
for
one
thing
there
is
a
natural
belt
of
rock
across
the
river
bed
for
another
it
was
here
that
one
of
the
old
caravan
routes
came
in
it
was
to
provide
a
safe
and
spacious
crossing
for
these
caravans
and
also
to
make
a
pleasance
for
the
city
that
shah
abbas
ii
in
about
built
of
sun
baked
brick
tile
and
stone
the
present
bridge
it
is
a
splendid
structure
from
upstream
it
looks
like
a
long
arcaded
box
laid
across
the
river
from
downstream
where
the
water
level
is
much
lower
it
is
a
high
elaborately
facaded
pavilion
the
top
story
contains
more
than
thirty
alcoves
separated
from
each
other
by
spandrels
of
blue
and
yellow
tile
at
either
end
and
in
the
center
there
are
bays
which
contain
nine
greater
alcoves
as
frescoed
and
capacious
as
church
apses
here
in
the
old
days
when
they
had
come
to
see
the
moon
or
displays
of
fireworks
sat
the
king
and
his
court
while
priests
soldiers
and
other
members
of
the
party
lounged
in
the
smaller
alcoves
between
below
twenty
vaults
tunnel
through
the
understructure
of
the
bridge
these
are
traversed
by
another
line
of
vaults
and
thus
rooms
arched
on
all
four
sides
are
formed
down
through
the
axis
of
the
bridge
there
is
a
long
diminishing
vista
like
a
visual
echo
of
piers
and
arches
while
the
vaults
fronting
upstream
and
down
frame
the
sunset
and
sunrise
the
mountains
and
river
pools
here
on
the
hottest
day
it
is
cool
beneath
the
stone
and
fresh
from
the
water
flowing
in
the
sluices
at
the
bottom
of
the
vaults
on
the
downstream
or
pavilion
side
these
vaults
give
out
onto
terraces
twice
as
wide
as
the
bridge
itself
from
the
terraces
eighteen
in
all
broad
flights
of
steps
descend
into
the
water
or
onto
still
more
terraces
barely
above
the
level
of
the
river
out
of
water
brick
and
tile
they
have
made
far
more
than
just
a
bridge
on
spring
and
summer
evenings
people
leave
their
shops
and
houses
and
walk
up
through
the
lanes
of
the
city
to
the
bridge
it
is
a
great
spectacle
the
bridge
itself
rises
up
from
the
river
light
flared
and
enormous
like
the
outdoor
set
for
an
epic
opera
crowds
press
along
the
terraces
down
the
steps
in
and
out
of
the
arcades
massing
against
it
as
though
it
were
a
fortress
under
siege
all
kinds
come
to
walk
in
the
promenade
merchants
from
the
bazaar
bickering
over
a
deal
a
bakhtiari
khan
in
a
cap
and
hacking
jacket
dervishes
who
stand
with
the
stillness
of
the
blind
their
eyes
filmed
with
rheum
and
visions
the
old
kajar
princes
arriving
in
their
ancient
limousines
students
civil
servants
beggars
musicians
hawkers
and
clowns
families
go
out
to
the
edge
of
the
terraces
to
sit
on
carpets
around
a
samovar
below
people
line
the
steps
as
though
on
bleachers
to
watch
the
sky
and
river
above
in
the
tiled
prosceniums
of
the
alcoves
boys
sing
the
ghazals
of
hafiz
and
saadi
while
at
the
very
bottom
in
the
vaults
the
toughs
and
blades
of
the
city
hoot
and
bang
their
drums
drink
arak
play
dice
and
dance
here
in
an
evening
persians
enjoy
many
of
the
things
which
are
important
to
them
poetry
water
the
moon
a
beautiful
face
to
a
stranger
their
delight
in
these
things
may
seem
paradoxical
for
persians
chase
the
golden
calf
as
much
as
any
people
many
of
them
moreover
are
beginning
to
complain
about
the
scarcity
of
western
amusements
and
to
ridicule
the
old
life
of
the
bazaar
merchant
the
mullah
and
the
peasant
nonetheless
they
take
time
out
much
time
from
the
game
of
grab
and
these
new
western
experiments
to
go
to
the
gardens
and
riverbanks
above
all
they
will
stop
in
the
middle
of
anything
anywhere
to
hear
or
quote
some
poetry
poetry
in
persian
life
is
far
more
than
a
common
ground
on
which
in
a
society
deeply
fissured
by
antagonisms
all
may
stand
it
contains
in
fact
their
whole
outlook
on
life
and
it
is
expressed
at
least
to
their
taste
in
a
perfect
form
poetry
for
a
persian
is
nothing
less
than
truth
and
beauty
in
most
western
cultures
today
these
twins
have
been
sent
away
to
the
libraries
and
museums
in
persia
where
practically
speaking
there
are
no
museums
or
libraries
or
for
that
matter
hardly
any
books
the
twins
run
free
it
is
perhaps
difficult
to
conceive
but
imagine
that
tonight
on
london
bridge
the
teddy
boys
of
the
east
end
will
gather
to
sing
marlowe
herrick
shakespeare
and
perhaps
some
lyrics
of
their
own
that
at
any
rate
is
what
happens
at
the
khaju
bridge
boys
and
men
go
along
the
riverbank
or
to
the
alcoves
in
the
top
arcade
here
in
these
little
rooms
or
stages
arched
open
to
the
sky
and
river
they
choose
a
few
lines
out
of
the
hundreds
they
may
know
and
sing
them
according
to
one
of
the
modes
into
which
persian
music
is
divided
each
mode
is
believed
to
have
a
specific
attribute
one
inducing
pleasure
another
generosity
another
love
and
so
on
to
include
all
of
the
emotions
the
singer
simply
matches
the
poem
to
a
mode
for
example
the
mode
of
bravery
to
this
anonymous
folk
poem
they
brought
me
news
that
spring
is
in
the
plains
and
ahmad
s
blood
the
crimson
tulip
stains
go
tell
his
aged
mother
that
her
son
fought
with
a
thousand
foes
and
he
was
one
or
the
mode
of
love
to
this
fragment
by
a
recent
poet
know
ye
fair
folk
who
dwell
on
earth
or
shall
hereafter
come
to
birth
that
here
with
dust
upon
his
eyes
iraj
the
sweet
tongued
singer
lies
in
this
true
lover
s
tomb
interred
a
world
of
love
lies
sepulchred
these
songs
practically
all
persian
music
for
that
matter
are
limited
to
a
range
of
two
octaves
yet
within
this
limitation
there
is
an
astonishing
variety
design
as
intricate
as
that
in
the
carpet
or
miniature
with
the
melodic
line
like
the
painted
or
woven
line
often
flowing
into
an
arabesque

maestro
s
stop
overs
in
new
york
before
he
left
for
europe
as
we
began
to
converse
in
the
lounge
of
his
fifth
avenue
hotel
his
restlessness
and
sensitivity
to
light
and
sound
became
immediately
apparent
seeking
an
obscure
dark
relatively
quiet
corner
in
the
airy
room
otherwise
suffused
with
afternoon
sunshine
he
asked
if
the
soft
background
music
could
be
turned
off
unfortunately
it
was
muzak
which
automatically
is
piped
into
the
public
rooms
and
which
nolens
volens
had
to
be
endured
as
he
talked
about
himself
time
and
again
stuffing
and
dragging
on
his
pipe
steinberg
began
to
relax
and
the
initial
hurried
feeling
grew
faint
and
was
dispelled
did
he
come
from
a
musical
family
yes
though
not
professional
musicians
they
were
a
music
loving
family
in
his
native
cologne
where
his
mother
taught
him
to
play
the
piano
he
was
able
to
read
notes
before
he
learned
the
alphabet
she
even
devised
a
system
of
colors
whereby
the
boy
could
easily
distinguish
the
different
note
values
when
he
started
school
at
the
age
of
five
and
a
half
he
could
not
understand
why
the
alphabet
begins
with
the
letter
a
instead
of
c
as
in
the
scale
because
like
many
other
children
he
intensely
disliked
practicing
czerny
etudes
he
composed
his
own
studies
when
he
was
eight
he
began
violin
lessons
soon
he
was
playing
in
the
cologne
municipal
orchestra
and
during
world
war
i
when
musicians
were
scarce
he
joined
the
opera
orchestra
as
well
steinberg
claims
that
these
early
years
of
orchestra
participation
were
of
invaluable
help
to
his
career
by
observing
the
conductor
he
says
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
i
learned
how
not
to
conduct
the
musician
ran
away
from
school
when
he
was
fifteen
but
this
escapade
did
not
save
him
from
the
gymnasium
simultaneously
he
pursued
his
musical
studies
at
the
conservatory
receiving
sound
training
in
counterpoint
and
harmony
as
well
in
the
violin
and
piano
his
professional
career
began
when
he
was
twenty
he
became
otto
klemperer
s
personal
assistant
at
the
cologne
opera
and
a
year
later
was
promoted
to
the
position
of
regular
conductor
was
n
t
this
an
unusually
young
age
to
fill
such
a
responsible
post
yes
the
maestro
assented
had
he
always
wished
to
be
a
conductor
no
originally
he
had
hoped
to
become
a
concert
pianist
and
had
even
performed
as
such
however
when
he
assumed
the
duties
of
a
conductor
he
relinquished
his
career
as
a
pianist
five
years
were
spent
with
the
cologne
opera
after
which
he
was
called
to
prague
by
alexander
von
zemlinsky
teacher
of
arnold
sch
nberg
and
erich
korngold
in
he
succeeded
zemlinsky
as
opera
director
of
the
german
theater
at
prague
during
his
tenure
he
also
fulfilled
guest
engagements
at
the
berlin
state
opera
two
years
later
he
became
director
of
the
frankfurt
opera
where
he
remained
until
he
lost
this
position
in
through
the
rise
of
the
hitler
regime
during
these
years
the
youthful
conductor
had
contributed
greatly
to
the
high
level
of
musical
life
in
germany
he
had
presented
the
first
german
performances
of
puccini
s
manon
lescaut
and
de
falla
s
la
vida
breve
the
frankfurt
years
were
particularly
noteworthy
for
his
performance
of
berg
s
wozzek
soon
after
the
berlin
premiere
under
erich
kleiber
and
the
world
premiere
of
sch
nberg
s
von
heute
auf
morgen
at
the
outset
of
his
career
steinberg
had
dedicated
himself
to
the
advancement
of
contemporary
music
by
vowing
to
do
a
sch
nberg
work
every
year
in
frankfurt
too
he
directed
the
museum
and
opera
house
concerts
which
in
addition
to
the
standard
repertoire
featured
novelties
like
erdmann
s
piano
concerto
and
mahler
s
sixth
symphony
because
of
the
political
upheaval
in
germany
in
the
s
steinberg
was
forced
to
restrict
his
activities
to
the
jewish
community
through
the
frankfurt
jewish
kulturbund
he
began
to
give
sonata
recitals
in
synagogues
with
cellist
emanuel
feuermann
as
more
and
more
jewish
musicians
lost
their
jobs
with
professional
organizations
steinberg
united
them
into
the
frankfurt
kulturbund
orchestra
which
also
gave
guest
performances
in
other
german
cities
in
he
accepted
the
leadership
of
the
berlin
kulturbund
in
the
fall
of
that
year
the
best
musicians
of
the
berlin
and
frankfurt
kulturbund
orchestras
joined
under
the
combined
efforts
of
bronislaw
hubermann
and
steinberg
to
become
the
palestine
orchestra
now
known
as
the
israel
philharmonic
orchestra
with
steinberg
as
founder
conductor
in
at
the
insistence
of
arturo
toscanini
steinberg
left
germany
for
the
united
states
by
way
of
switzerland
after
he
had
spent
the
first
three
years
in
new
york
as
associate
conductor
at
toscanini
s
invitation
of
the
nbc
orchestra
he
made
numerous
guest
appearances
throughout
the
united
states
and
latin
america
in
he
became
conductor
of
the
buffalo
philharmonic
seven
years
later
he
was
asked
to
become
director
of
the
pittsburgh
symphony
since
he
has
also
conducted
regularly
at
the
san
francisco
opera
where
he
made
his
debut
with
a
memorable
performance
of
verdi
s
falstaff
in
recent
years
he
has
traveled
widely
in
europe
conducting
in
italy
france
austria
and
switzerland
he
returned
to
germany
for
the
first
time
in
where
he
has
since
conducted
in
cologne
frankfurt
and
berlin
where
in
europe
was
he
going
now
first
of
all
to
italy
for
a
short
vacation
forte
dei
marmi
a
place
he
loves
since
it
is
not
far
from
viareggio
he
will
visit
puccini
s
house
as
he
never
fails
to
do
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
memory
of
the
composer
of
la
boheme
which
he
considers
one
of
puccini
s
masterpieces
steinberg
spoke
with
warmth
and
enthusiasm
about
italy
rome
is
my
second
home
i
consider
it
the
center
of
the
world
and
make
it
a
point
to
be
there
once
a
year
he
will
conduct
two
concerts
at
the
accademia
di
santa
cecilia
as
well
as
concerts
in
munich
and
cologne
then
i
return
to
the
united
states
for
engagements
at
the
hollywood
bowl
and
in
philadelphia
he
added
the
forthcoming
season
in
pittsburgh
also
promises
to
be
of
unusual
interest
there
will
be
premieres
of
new
works
made
possible
through
ford
foundation
commissions
carlisle
floyd
s
mystery
with
phyllis
curtin
as
soprano
soloist
other
world
premieres
will
be
gardner
read
s
third
symphony
and
burle
marx
s
samba
concertante
and
next
year
we
will
do
also
a
ford
commission
a
piano
concerto
by
elliott
carter
with
jacob
lateiner
as
soloist
of
course
i
shall
conduct
mahler
and
bruckner
works
in
the
coming
season
as
usual
we
ll
play
bruckner
s
fifth
symphony
in
the
original
version
and
mahler
s
seventh
the
least
accessible
known
and
played
of
mahler
s
works
my
pittsburghers
have
become
real
addicts
to
mahler
and
bruckner
he
added
that
he
also
stresses
the
works
of
these
favorite
masters
on
tour
especially
mahler
s
first
and
fourth
symphonies
and
das
lied
von
der
erde
and
bruckner
s
sixth
which
is
rarely
played
and
seventh
bruckner
s
eighth
he
refers
to
as
my
travel
symphony
he
recalled
that
in
california
after
a
critic
had
attacked
him
for
still
trying
to
sell
bruckner
to
the
americans
the
public
s
response
at
the
next
concert
was
a
standing
ovation
now
that
bruno
walter
is
virtually
in
retirement
and
my
dear
friend
dimitri
mitropoulos
is
no
longer
with
us
i
am
probably
the
only
one
with
the
possible
exception
of
leonard
bernstein
who
has
this
special
affinity
for
and
champions
the
works
of
bruckner
and
mahler
since
he
introduces
so
much
modern
music
i
could
not
resist
asking
how
he
felt
about
it
there
was
always
and
at
all
times
a
contemporary
music
and
it
expresses
the
era
in
which
it
was
created
but
i
usually
stick
to
the
old
phrase
ich
habe
ein
amt
aber
keine
meinung
i
hold
an
office
but
i
do
not
feel
entitled
to
have
an
opinion
i
consider
it
to
be
my
job
to
expose
the
public
to
what
is
being
written
today
with
all
his
musical
activities
did
he
have
the
time
and
inclination
to
do
anything
else
he
had
just
paid
a
brief
visit
to
the
frick
collection
to
admire
his
favorite
paintings
by
rembrandt
and
franz
hals
he
was
not
enthusiastic
over
the
newly
acquired
claude
lorrain
but
reminisced
with
pleasure
over
a
poussin
exhibit
he
had
been
able
to
see
in
paris
a
year
ago
and
how
did
he
feel
about
modern
art
again
steinberg
was
cautious
and
replied
with
a
smile
that
he
was
not
exposed
to
it
enough
to
hazard
comments
as
my
wife
puts
it
he
said
again
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
all
you
know
is
your
music
but
after
all
you
never
learned
anything
else
what
did
he
do
for
relaxation
like
his
late
colleague
mitropoulos
he
reads
mystery
stories
in
particular
sir
arthur
conan
doyle
he
cited
heine
and
stendhal
as
favorites
in
literature
but
his
prime
interest
apart
from
music
he
insisted
seriously
was
his
family
his
wife
daughter
and
son
at
the
moment
he
was
excited
about
his
son
s
having
received
the
prix
de
rome
in
archaeology
and
was
looking
forward
to
being
present
this
summer
at
the
excavation
of
an
etruscan
tomb
both
children
are
musical
and
my
wife
is
a
music
lover
of
unfailing
instinct
and
judgment
is
the
attitude
of
german
youth
comparable
to
that
of
the
angry
young
men
of
england
was
the
topic
for
a
round
table
discussion
at
the
bayerische
rundfunk
in
munich
i
was
chairman
the
only
not
youthful
participant
since
attack
serves
to
stimulate
interest
in
broadcasts
i
added
to
my
opening
statement
a
sentence
in
which
i
claimed
that
german
youth
seemed
to
lack
the
enthusiasm
which
is
a
necessary
ingredient
of
anger
and
might
be
classified
as
uninterested
and
bored
rather
than
angry
i
was
far
from
convinced
of
the
truth
of
my
statement
but
could
not
think
of
anything
that
might
evoke
responses
more
quickly
it
is
easy
for
you
to
talk
countered
a
twenty
year
old
law
student
you
travel
around
the
world
we
would
like
to
do
that
too
but
you
want
a
job
guaranteed
when
you
return
i
continued
my
attack
you
must
have
some
security
said
a
young
clerk
when
i
mentioned
that
for
my
first
long
voyage
i
did
not
even
have
the
money
for
the
return
fare
but
had
trusted
to
luck
that
i
would
earn
a
sufficient
amount
the
young
people
looked
at
me
doubtingly
one
girl
expressed
what
was
obviously
in
their
minds
would
you
advise
us
to
act
the
same
way
you
might
have
failed
i
think
it
is
rather
foolhardy
to
trust
to
luck
others
mentioned
that
i
might
have
had
to
ask
friends
or
even
strangers
for
help
and
that
to
be
stranded
in
a
foreign
country
without
sufficient
funds
did
not
contribute
to
international
understanding
the
debate
needed
no
additional
controversy
and
soon
i
could
ask
each
individually
what
he
expected
from
life
what
his
hopes
were
and
what
his
fears
though
the
four
boys
and
two
girls
the
youngest
nineteen
years
of
age
the
oldest
twenty
four
came
from
varying
backgrounds
and
had
different
professional
and
personal
interests
there
was
surprising
agreement
among
them
what
they
wished
for
most
was
security
what
they
feared
most
was
war
or
political
instability
in
their
own
country
the
ideal
home
they
agreed
would
be
a
small
private
house
or
a
city
apartment
of
four
to
five
rooms
just
enough
for
a
family
consisting
of
husband
wife
and
two
children
no
one
wanted
a
larger
family
or
no
children
and
none
hoped
for
a
castle
or
said
that
living
in
less
settled
circumstances
would
be
satisfactory
all
expressed
interest
in
world
affairs
but
no
one
offered
to
make
any
sacrifices
to
satisfy
this
interest
once
again
as
in
the
days
of
the
founding
fathers
america
faces
a
stern
test
that
test
as
president
kennedy
forthrightly
depicted
it
in
his
state
of
the
union
message
will
determine
whether
a
nation
organized
and
governed
such
as
ours
can
endure
it
is
well
then
that
in
this
hour
both
of
national
peril
and
of
national
opportunity
we
can
take
counsel
with
the
men
who
made
the
nation
incapable
of
self
delusion
the
founding
fathers
found
the
crisis
of
their
time
to
be
equally
grave
and
yet
they
had
confidence
that
america
would
surmount
it
and
that
a
republic
of
free
peoples
would
prosper
and
serve
as
an
example
to
a
world
aching
for
liberty
seven
founders
george
washington
benjamin
franklin
john
adams
thomas
jefferson
alexander
hamilton
james
madison
and
john
jay
determined
the
destinies
of
the
new
nation
in
certain
respects
their
task
was
incomparably
greater
than
ours
today
for
there
was
nobody
before
them
to
show
them
the
way
as
madison
commented
to
jefferson
in
we
are
in
a
wilderness
without
a
single
footstep
to
guide
us
our
successors
will
have
an
easier
task
they
thought
of
themselves
to
use
jefferson
s
words
as
the
argonauts
who
had
lived
in
the
heroic
age
accordingly
they
took
special
pains
to
preserve
their
papers
as
essential
sources
for
posterity
their
writings
assume
more
than
dramatic
or
patriotic
interest
because
of
their
conviction
that
the
struggle
in
which
they
were
involved
was
neither
selfish
nor
parochial
but
rather
as
washington
in
his
last
wartime
circular
reminded
his
fellow
countrymen
that
with
our
fate
will
the
destiny
of
unborn
millions
be
involved
strong
men
with
strong
opinions
frank
to
the
point
of
being
refreshingly
indiscreet
the
founding
seven
were
essentially
congenial
minds
and
their
agreements
with
each
other
were
more
consequential
than
their
differences
even
though
in
most
cases
the
completion
of
the
definitive
editions
of
their
writings
is
still
years
off
enough
documentation
has
already
been
assembled
to
warrant
drawing
a
new
composite
profile
of
the
leadership
which
performed
the
heroic
dual
feats
of
winning
american
independence
and
founding
a
new
nation
before
merging
them
into
a
common
profile
it
is
well
to
remember
that
their
separate
careers
were
extraordinary
certainly
no
other
seven
american
statesmen
from
any
later
period
achieved
so
much
in
so
concentrated
a
span
of
years
eldest
of
the
seven
benjamin
franklin
a
new
englander
transplanted
to
philadelphia
wrote
the
most
dazzling
success
story
in
our
history
the
young
printer
s
apprentice
achieved
greatness
in
a
half
dozen
different
fields
as
editor
and
publisher
scientist
inventor
philanthropist
and
statesman
author
of
the
albany
plan
of
union
which
had
it
been
adopted
might
have
avoided
the
revolution
he
fought
the
colonists
front
line
battles
in
london
negotiated
the
treaty
of
alliance
with
france
and
the
peace
that
ended
the
war
headed
the
state
government
of
pennsylvania
and
exercised
an
important
moderating
influence
at
the
federal
convention
on
a
military
mission
for
his
native
virginia
the
youthful
george
washington
touched
off
the
french
and
indian
war
then
guarded
his
colony
s
frontier
as
head
of
its
militia
commanding
the
continental
army
for
six
long
years
of
the
revolution
he
was
the
indispensable
factor
in
the
ultimate
victory
retiring
to
his
beloved
mount
vernon
he
returned
to
preside
over
the
federal
convention
and
was
the
only
man
in
history
to
be
unanimously
elected
president
during
his
two
terms
the
constitution
was
tested
and
found
workable
strong
national
policies
were
inaugurated
and
the
traditions
and
powers
of
the
presidential
office
firmly
fixed
john
adams
fashioned
much
of
pre
revolutionary
radical
ideology
wrote
the
constitution
of
his
home
state
of
massachusetts
negotiated
with
franklin
and
jay
the
peace
with
britain
and
served
as
our
first
vice
president
and
our
second
president
his
political
opponent
and
lifetime
friend
thomas
jefferson
achieved
immortality
through
his
authorship
of
the
declaration
of
independence
but
equally
notable
were
the
legal
and
constitutional
reforms
he
instituted
in
his
native
virginia
his
role
as
father
of
our
territorial
system
and
his
acquisition
of
the
louisiana
territory
during
his
first
term
as
president
during
the
greater
part
of
jefferson
s
career
he
enjoyed
the
close
collaboration
of
a
fellow

years
his

madison
played
the
most
influential
single
role
in
the
drafting
of
the
constitution
and
in
securing
its
ratification
in
virginia
founded
the
first
political
party
in
american
history
and
as
jefferson
s
secretary
of
state
and
his
successor
in
the
presidency
guided
the
nation
through
the
troubled
years
of
our
second
war
with
britain
if
franklin
was
an
authentic
genius
then
alexander
hamilton
with
his
exceptional
precocity
consuming
energy
and
high
ambition
was
a
political
prodigy
his
revolutionary
pamphlets
published
when
he
was
only
quickly
brought
him
to
the
attention
of
the
patriot
leaders
principal
author
of
the
federalist
he
swung
new
york
over
from
opposition
to
the
constitution
to
ratification
almost
single
handedly
his
collaboration
with
washington
begun
when
he
was
the
general
s
aide
during
the
revolution
was
resumed
when
he
entered
the
first
cabinet
as
secretary
of
the
treasury
his
bold
fiscal
program
and
his
broad
interpretation
of
the
constitution
stand
as
durable
contributions
less
dazzling
than
hamilton
less
eloquent
than
jefferson
john
jay
commands
an
equally
high
rank
among
the
founding
fathers
he
served
as
president
of
the
continental
congress
he
played
the
leading
role
in
negotiating
the
treaty
with
great
britain
that
ended
the
revolution
and
directed
america
s
foreign
affairs
throughout
the
confederation
period
as
first
chief
justice
his
strong
nationalist
opinions
anticipated
john
marshall
he
ended
his
public
career
as
a
two
term
governor
of
new
york
these
seven
founders
constituted
an
intellectual
and
social
elite
the
most
respectable
and
disinterested
leadership
any
revolution
ever
confessed
their
social
status
was
achieved
in
some
cases
by
birth
as
with
washington
jefferson
and
jay
in
others
by
business
and
professional
acumen
as
with
franklin
and
adams
or
in
hamilton
s
case
by
an
influential
marriage
unlike
so
many
of
the
power
starved
intellectuals
in
underdeveloped
nations
of
our
own
day
they
commanded
both
prestige
and
influence
before
the
revolution
started
as
different
physically
as
the
tall
angular
jefferson
was
from
the
chubby
rotund
adams
the
seven
were
striking
individualists
ardent
opinionated
even
obstinate
they
were
amazingly
articulate
wrote
their
own
copy
and
were
masters
of
phrasemaking
capable
of
enduring
friendships
they
were
also
stout
controversialists
who
could
write
with
a
drop
of
vitriol
on
their
pens
john
adams
dismissed
john
dickinson
who
voted
against
the
declaration
of
independence
as
a
certain
great
fortune
and
piddling
genius
washington
castigated
his
critic
general
conway
as
being
capable
of
all
the
meanness
of
intrigue
to
gratify
the
absurd
resentment
of
disappointed
vanity
and
hamilton
who
felt
it
a
religious
duty
to
oppose
aaron
burr
s
political
ambitions
would
have
been
a
better
actuarial
risk
had
he
shown
more
literary
restraint
the
seven
founders
were
completely
dedicated
to
the
public
service
madison
once
remarked
my
life
has
been
so
much
a
public
one
a
comment
which
fits
the
careers
of
the
other
six
franklin
retired
from
editing
and
publishing
at
the
age
of
and
for
the
next
forty
two
years
devoted
himself
to
public
scientific
and
philanthropic
interests
washington
never
had
a
chance
to
work
for
an
extended
stretch
at
the
occupation
he
loved
best
plantation
management
he
served
as
commander
in
chief
during
the
revolution
without
compensation
john
adams
took
to
heart
the
advice
given
him
by
his
legal
mentor
jeremiah
gridley
to
pursue
the
study
of
the
law
rather
than
the
gain
of
it
in
taking
account
of
seventeen
years
of
law
practice
adams
concluded
that
no
lawyer
in
america
ever
did
so
much
business
as
i
did
and
for
so
little
profit
when
the
revolution
broke
out
he
along
with
jefferson
and
jay
abandoned
his
career
at
the
bar
with
considerable
financial
sacrifice
hamilton
poorest
of
the
seven
gave
up
a
brilliant
law
practice
to
enter
washington
s
cabinet
while
he
was
handling
the
multi
million
dollar
funding
operations
of
the
government
he
had
to
resort
to
borrowing
small
sums
from
friends
if
you
can
conveniently
let
me
have
twenty
dollars
he
wrote
one
friend
in
when
he
was
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
support
his
large
family
hamilton
went
back
to
the
law
after
each
spell
of
public
service
talleyrand
passed
his
new
york
law
office
one
night
on
the
way
to
a
party
hamilton
was
bent
over
his
desk
drafting
a
legal
paper
by
the
light
of
a
candle
the
frenchman
was
astonished
i
have
just
come
from
viewing
a
man
who
had
made
the
fortune
of
his
country
but
now
is
working
all
night
in
order
to
support
his
family
he
reflected
all
seven
combined
ardent
devotion
to
the
cause
of
revolution
with
a
profound
respect
for
legality
john
adams
asserted
in
the
continental
congress
declaration
of
rights
that
the
demands
of
the
colonies
were
in
accordance
with
their
charters
the
british
constitution
and
the
common
law
and
jefferson
appealed
in
the
declaration
of
independence
to
the
tribunal
of
the
world
for
support
of
a
revolution
justified
by
the
laws
of
nature
and
of
nature
s
god
they
fought
hard
but
they
were
forgiving
to
former
foes
and
sought
to
prevent
vindictive
legislatures
from
confiscating
tory
property
in
violation
of
the
treaty
of
this
sense
of
moderation
and
fairness
is
superbly
exemplified
in
an
exchange
of
letters
between
john
jay
and
a
tory
refugee
peter
van
schaack
jay
had
participated
in
the
decision
that
exiled
his
old
friend
van
schaack
yet
when
at
war
s
end
the
ex
tory
made
the
first
move
to
resume
correspondence
jay
wrote
him
from
paris
where
he
was
negotiating
the
peace
settlement
as
an
independent
american
i
considered
all
who
were
not
for
us
and
you
amongst
the
rest
as
against
us
yet
be
assured
that
john
jay
never
ceased
to
be
the
friend
of
peter
van
schaack
the
latter
in
turn
assured
him
that
were
i
arraigned
at
the
bar
and
you
my
judge
i
should
expect
to
stand
or
fall
only
by
the
merits
of
my
cause
all
seven
recognized
that
independence
was
but
the
first
step
toward
building
a
nation
we
have
now
a
national
character
to
establish
washington
wrote
in
think
continentally
hamilton
counseled
the
young
nation
this
new
force
love
of
country
super
imposed
upon
if
not
displacing
affectionate
ties
to
one
s
own
state
was
epitomized
by
washington
his
first
inaugural
address
speaks
of
my
country
whose
voice
i
can
never
hear
but
with
veneration
and
love
all
sought
the
fruition
of
that
nationalism
in
a
federal
government
with
substantial
powers
save
jefferson
all
participated
in
the
framing
or
ratification
of
the
federal
constitution
they
supported
it
not
as
a
perfect
instrument
but
as
the
best
obtainable
historians
have
traditionally
regarded
the
great
debates
of
the
seventeen
nineties
as
polarizing
the
issues
of
centralized
vs
limited
government
with
hamilton
and
the
nationalists
supporting
the
former
and
jefferson
and
madison
upholding
the
latter
position
the
state
s
rights
position
was
formulated
by
jefferson
and
madison
in
the
kentucky
and
virginia
resolves
but
in
their
later
careers
as
heads
of
state
the
two
proved
themselves
better
hamiltonians
than
jeffersonians
in
purchasing
louisiana
jefferson
had
to
adopt
hamilton
s
broad
construction
of
the
constitution
and
so
did
madison
in
advocating
the
rechartering
of
hamilton
s
bank
which
he
had
so
strenuously
opposed
at
its
inception
and
in
adopting
a
hamiltonian
protective
tariff
indeed
the
old
jeffersonians
were
far
more
atune
to
the
hamilton
oriented
whigs
than
they
were
to
the
jacksonian
democrats
when
in
the
south
carolina
nullifiers
adopted
the
principle
of
state
interposition
which
madison
had
advanced
in
his
old
virginia
resolve
they
elicited
no
encouragement
from
that
senior
statesman
in
his
political
testament
advice
to
my
country
penned
just
before
his
death
madison
expressed
the
wish
that
the
union
of
the
states
be
cherished
and
perpetuated
let
the
open
enemy
to
it
be
regarded
as
a
pandora
with
her
box
opened
and
the
disguised
one
as
the
serpent
creeping
with
his
deadly
wiles
into
paradise
tobacco
road
is
dead
long
live
tobacco
road
nostalgic
yankee
readers
of
erskine
caldwell
are
today
informed
by
proud
georgians
that
tobacco
road
is
buried
beneath
a
four
lane
super
highway
over
which
travel
each
day
suburbanite
businessmen
more
concerned
with
the
dow
jones
average
than
with
the
cotton
crop
thus
we
are
compelled
to
face
the
urbanization
of
the
south
an
urbanization
which
despite
its
dramatic
and
overwhelming
effects
upon
the
southern
culture
has
been
utterly
ignored
by
the
bulk
of
southern
writers
indeed
it
seems
that
only
in
today
s
southern
fiction
does
tobacco
road
with
all
the
traditional
trimmings
of
sowbelly
and
cornbread
and
mint
juleps
continue
to
live
but
only
as
a
weary
overexploited
phantom
those
writers
known
collectively
as
the
southern
school
have
received
accolades
from
even
those
critics
least
prone
to
eulogize
according
to
many
critics
in
fact
the
south
has
led
the
north
in
literature
since
the
civil
war
both
quantitatively
and
qualitatively
such
writers
as
william
faulkner
and
robert
penn
warren
have
led
the
field
of
somewhat
less
important
writers
in
a
sort
of
post
bellum
renaissance
it
is
interesting
however
that
despite
this
strong
upsurge
in
southern
writing
almost
none
of
the
writers
has
forsaken
the
firmly
entrenched
concept
of
the
white
suited
big
daddy
colonel
sipping
a
mint
julep
as
he
silently
recounts
the
revenue
from
the
season
s
cotton
and
tobacco
crops
of
the
stereotyped
negro
servants
chanting
hymns
as
they
plow
the
fields
of
these
and
a
host
of
other
antiquated
legends
that
deny
the
south
its
progressive
leaps
of
the
past
century
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
south
is
no
longer
agrarian
such
a
statement
would
be
the
rankest
form
of
oversimplification
but
the
south
is
and
has
been
for
the
past
century
engaged
in
a
wide
sweeping
urbanization
which
oddly
enough
is
not
reflected
in
its
literature
in
the
south
was
only
urban
in
it
had
become
urban
in
a
mere
half
century
the
south
has
more
than
tripled
its
urban
status
there
is
a
new
south
emerging
a
south
losing
the
folksy
traditions
of
an
agrarian
society
with
the
rapidity
of
an
avalanche
especially
within
recent
decades
as
the
new
south
snowballs
toward
further
urbanization
it
becomes
more
and
more
homogeneous
with
the
north
a
tendency
which
willard
thorp
terms
yankeefication
as
evidenced
in
such
cities
as
charlotte
birmingham
and
houston
it
is
said
that
even
at
the
present
stage
of
southern
urbanization
such
a
city
as
atlanta
is
not
distinctly
unlike
columbus
or
trenton
undoubtedly
even
the
old
southern
stalwart
richmond
has
felt
the
new
wind
william
styron
mentions
in
his
latest
novel
an
avenue
named
for
bankhead
mcgruder
a
civil
war
general
now
renamed
in
typical
california
fashion
buena
vista
terrace
the
effects
of
television
and
other
mass
media
are
erasing
regional
dialects
and
localisms
with
a
startling
force
as
for
progress
the
backward
south
can
boast
of
baton
rouge
which
increased
its
population
between
and
by
two
hundred
and
sixty
two
percent
to
the
second
largest
growth
of
the
period
for
all
cities
over
the
field
then
is
ripe
for
new
southerners
to
step
to
the
fore
and
write
of
this
twentieth
century
phenomenon
the
southern
yankeefication
the
new
urban
economy
the
city
dweller
the
pains
of
transition
the
labor
problems
the
list
is
obviously
endless
but
these
sources
have
not
been
tapped
truman
capote
is
still
reveling
in
southern
gothicism
exaggerating
the
old
southern
legends
into
something
beautiful
and
grotesque
but
as
unreal
as
or
even
more
unreal
than
yesterday
william
styron
while
facing
the
changing
economy
with
a
certain
uneasy
reluctance
insists
he
is
not
to
be
classified
as
a
southern
writer
and
yet
includes
traditional
southern
concepts
in
everything
he
publishes
even
the
great
god
faulkner
the
south
s
one
probable
contender
for
literary
immortality
has
little
concerned
himself
with
these
matters
such
are
simply
not
within
his
bounded
province
where
are
the
writers
to
treat
these
changes
has
the
agrarian
tradition
become
such
an
addiction
that
the
switch
to
urbanism
is
somehow
dreaded
or
unwanted
perhaps
present
writers
hypnotically
cling
to
the
older
order
because
they
consider
it
useful
and
reliable
through
repeated
testings
over
the
decades
lacking
the
pioneer
spirit
necessary
to
write
of
a
new
economy
these
writers
seem
to
be
contenting
themselves
with
an
old
one
that
is
now
as
defunct
as
confederate
money
an
example
of
the
changes
which
have
crept
over
the
southern
region
may
be
seen
in
the
southern
negro
s
quest
for
a
position
in
the
white
dominated
society
a
problem
that
has
been
reflected
in
regional
fiction
especially
since
today
the
negro
must
discover
his
role
in
an
industrialized
south
which
indicates
that
the
racial
aspect
of
the
southern
dilemma
has
n
t
changed
radically
but
rather
has
gradually
come
to
be
reflected
in
this
new
context
this
new
coat
of
paint
the
negro
faces
as
much
if
not
more
difficulty
in
fitting
himself
into
an
urban
economy
as
he
did
in
an
agrarian
one
this
represents
a
gradual
change
in
an
ever
present
social
problem
but
there
have
been
abrupt
changes
as
well
the
sit
ins
the
picket
lines
the
bus
strikes
all
of
these
were
unheard
of
even
ten
years
ago
today
s
evidence
such
as
the
fact
that
only
three
southern
states
south
carolina
alabama
and
mississippi
still
openly
defy
integration
would
have
astounded
many
of
yesterday
s
southerners
into
speechlessness
other
examples
of
gradual
changes
that
have
affected
the
negro
have
been
his
moving
up
row
by
row
in
the
busses
his
requesting
and
often
getting
higher
wages
better
working
conditions
better
schools
changes
that
were
slowly
emerging
even
before
the
supreme
court
decision
of
then
came
this
decision
which
sped
the
process
of
gaining
equality
or
perhaps
hindered
it
only
historical
evolution
will
determine
which
an
abrupt
change
since
the
negro
s
desire
for
social
justice
has
led
to
an
ironically
anarchical
rebellion
he
has
frequently
refused
to
move
from
white
lunch
counters
refused
to
obey
local
laws
which
he
considers
unjust
while
in
other
cases
he
has
appealed
to
federal
laws
this
bold
self
assertion
after
decades
of
humble
subservience
is
indeed
a
twentieth
century
phenomenon
an
abrupt
change
in
the
southern
way
of
existence
a
new
order
is
thrusting
itself
into
being
a
new
south
is
emerging
after
the
post
bellum
years
of
hesitation
uncertainty
and
lack
of
action
from
the
negro
in
defining
his
new
role
in
the
amorphously
defined
socio
political
organizations
of
the
white
man
the
modern
negro
has
not
made
a
decisive
debut
into
southern
fiction
it
is
clear
that
while
most
writers
enjoy
picturing
the
negro
as
a
woolly
headed
humble
old
agrarian
who
mutters
yassuhs
and
sho
nufs
with
blissful
deference
to
his
white
employer
or
in
old
south
terms
massuh
this
stereotype
is
doomed
to
become
in
reality
as
obsolete
as
caldwell
s
lester
while
there
may
still
be
many
faulknerian
lucas
beauchamps
scattered
through
the
rural
south
such
men
appear
to
be
a
vanishing
breed
writers
openly
admit
that
the
negro
is
easier
to
write
than
the
white
man
but
they
obviously
mean
by
this
not
a
negro
personality
but
a
negro
type
presenting
an
individualized
negro
character
it
would
seem
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
assignments
a
southern
writer
could
tackle
and
the
success
of
such
an
endeavor
is
as
suggested
above
glaringly
rare
just
as
the
negro
situation
points
up
the
gradual
and
abrupt
changes
affecting
southern
life
it
also
points
up
the
non
representation
of
urbanism
in
southern
literature
the
book
concerned
with
the
negro
s
role
in
an
urban
society
is
rare
indeed
recently
only
keith
wheeler
s
novel
peaceable
lane
has
openly
faced
the
problem
all
but
the
most
rabid
of
confederate
flag
wavers
admit
that
the
old
southern
tradition
is
defunct
in
actuality
and
sigh
that
its
passing
was
accompanied
by
the
disappearance
of
many
genteel
and
aristocratic
traditions
of
the
reputedly
languid
ante
bellum
way
of
life
many
earlier
writers
mourning
the
demise
of
the
old
order
tended
to
romanticize
and
exaggerate
this
gracious
old
south
imagery
creating
such
lasting
impressions
as
margaret
mitchell
s
tara
plantation
modern
writers
who
are
supposed
to
keep
their
fingers
firmly
upon
the
pulse
of
their
subjects
insist
upon
drawing
out
this
legend
prolonging
its
burial
when
it
well
deserves
a
rest
after
the
overexploitation
of
the
past
century
perhaps
these
writers
have
been
too
deeply
moved
by
this
romanticizing
but
they
can
hardly
deny
that
exaggerated
or
not
the
old
panorama
is
dead
as
john
t
westbrook
says
in
his
article
twilight
of
southern
regionalism
southwest
review
winter
the
miasmal
mausoleum
where
an
old
south
already
too
minutely
autopsied
in
prose
and
poetry
should
be
left
to
rest
in
peace
forever
dead
and
let
us
fervently
hope
forever
done
with
westbrook
further
bemoans
the
southern
writers
creation
of
an
unreal
image
of
their
homeland
which
is
too
readily
assimilated
by
both
foreign
readers
and
visiting
yankees
our
northerner
is
suspicious
of
all
this
crass
evidence
of
urbanization
presented
to
his
senses
it
bewilders
and
befuddles
him
he
is
too
deeply
steeped
in
william
faulkner
and
robert
penn
warren
the
fumes
of
progress
are
in
his
nose
and
the
bright
steel
of
industry
towers
before
his
eyes
but
his
heart
is
away
in
yoknapatawpha
county
with
razorback
hogs
and
night
riders
on
this
trip
to
the
south
he
wants
above
all
else
to
sniff
the
effluvium
of
backwoods
and
sand
hill
subhumanity
and
to
see
at
least
one
barn
burn
at
midnight
obviously
such
a
northern
tourist
s
purpose
is
somewhat
akin
to
a
child
s
experience
with
disneyland
he
wants
to
see
a
world
of
make
believe
in
the
meantime
while
the
south
has
been
undergoing
this
phenomenal
modernization
that
is
so
disappointing
to
the
curious
yankee
southern
writers
have
certainly
done
little
to
reflect
and
promote
their
region
s
progress
willard
thorp
in
his
new
book
american
writing
in
the
twentieth
century
observes
quite
validly
it
seems
certain
subjects
are
conspicuously
absent
or
have
been
only
lightly
touched
no
southern
novelist
has
done
for
atlanta
or
birmingham
what
herrick
dreiser
and
farrell
did
for
chicago
or
dos
passos
did
for
new
york
there
are
almost
no
fictional
treatments
of
the
industrialized
south
not
a
single
southern
author
major
or
minor
has
made
the
urban
problems
of
an
urban
south
his
primary
source
material
faulkner
for
one
appears
to
be
safe
from
the
accusing
fingers
of
all
assailants
in
this
regard
faulkner
culminates
the
southern
legend
perhaps
more
masterfully
than
it
has
ever
been
or
could
ever
be
done
he
has
made
it
his
and
his
it
remains
irrevocably
he
treats
it
with
a
mythological
universal
application
as
his
disciples
boast
even
though
his
emphasis
is
elsewhere
faulkner
does
show
his
awareness
of
the
changing
order
of
the
south
quite
keenly
as
can
be
proven
by
a
quick
recalling
of
his
sartoris
and
snopes
families
even
two
decades
ago
in
go
down
moses
faulkner
was
looking
to
the
more
urban
future
with
a
glimmer
of
hope
that
through
its
youth
and
its
new
way
of
life
the
south
might
be
reborn
and
the
curse
of
slavery
erased
from
its
soil
yet
his
concern
even
here
is
with
a
slowly
changing
socio
economic
order
in
general
and
he
never
deals
with
such
specific
aspects
of
this
change
as
the
urban
and
industrial
impact
faulkner
traces
in
his
vast
and
overpowering
saga
of
yoknapatawpha
county
the
gradual
changes
which
seep
into
the
south
building
layer
upon
layer
of
minute
subtle
innovation
which
eventually
tend
largely
to
hide
the
old
way
thus
faulkner
reminds
us
and
wisely
that
the
new
south
has
gradually
evolved
out
of
the
old
south
and
consequently
its
agrarian
roots
persist
yet
he
presents
a
realm
of
source
material
which
may
well
serve
other
writers
if
not
himself
the
problems
with
which
a
new
south
must
grapple
in
groping
through
a
blind
adolescence
into
the
maturity
of
urbanization
with
new
mechanization
the
modern
farmer
must
perform
the
work
of
six
men
a
machine
stands
between
the
agrarian
and
his
soil
the
thousands
of
city
migrants
who
desert
the
farms
yearly
must
readjust
with
even
greater
stress
and
tension
the
sacred
wilderness
is
gradually
surrendering
to
suburbs
and
research
parks
and
industrial
areas
another
element
to
concern
the
choreographer
is
that
of
the
visual
devices
of
the
theatre
most
avant
garde
creators
true
to
their
interest
in
the
self
sufficiency
of
pure
movement
have
tended
to
dress
their
dancers
in
simple
lines
and
solid
colors
often
black
and
to
give
them
a
bare
cyclorama
for
a
setting
but
robert
rauschenberg
the
neo
dadaist
artist
has
collaborated
with
several
of
them
he
has
designed
a
matching
backdrop
and
costumes
of
points
of
color
on
white
for
mr
cunningham
s
summerspace
so
that
dancers
and
background
merge
into
a
shimmering
unity
for
mr
taylor
s
images
and
reflections
he
made
some
diaphanous
tents
that
alternately
hide
and
reveal
the
performer
and
a
girl
s
cape
lined
with
grass
mr
nikolais
has
made
a
distinctive
contribution
to
the
arts
of
costume
and
decor
in
fact
he
calls
his
productions
dance
theatre
works
of
motion
shape
light
and
sound
to
raise
the
dancer
out
of
his
personal
pedestrian
self
mr
nikolais
has
experimented
with
relating
him
to
a
larger
environmental
orbit
he
began
with
masks
to
make
the
dancer
identify
himself
with
the
creature
he
appeared
to
be
he
went
on
to
use
objects
hoops
poles
capes
which
he
employed
as
extensions
of
the
body
of
the
dancer
who
moved
with
them
the
depersonalization
continued
as
the
dancer
was
further
metamorphosed
by
the
play
of
lights
upon
his
figure
in
each
case
the
object
the
color
even
the
percussive
sounds
of
the
electronic
score
were
designed
to
become
part
of
the
theatrical
being
of
the
performer
the
dancer
who
never
loosens
her
hold
on
a
parasol
begins
to
feel
that
it
is
part
of
herself
or
clad
from
head
to
toe
in
fabric
stretched
over
a
series
of
hoops
the
performer
may
well
lose
his
sense
of
self
in
being
a
finial
as
the
dancer
is
depersonalized
his
accouterments
are
animized
and
the
combined
elements
give
birth
to
a
new
being
from
this
being
come
new
movement
ideas
that
utilize
dancer
and
property
as
a
single
unit
thus
the
avant
garde
choreographers
have
extended
the
scope
of
materials
available
for
dance
composition
but
since
they
have
rejected
both
narrative
and
emotional
continuity
how
are
they
to
unify
the
impressive
array
of
materials
at
their
disposal
some
look
deliberately
to
devices
used
by
creators
in
the
other
arts
and
apply
corresponding
methods
to
their
own
work
others
less
consciously
but
quite
probably
influenced
by
the
trends
of
the
times
experiment
with
approaches
that
parallel
those
of
the
contemporary
poet
painter
and
musician
an
approach
that
has
appealed
to
some
choreographers
is
reminiscent
of
charles
olson
s
statement
of
the
process
of
projective
verse
one
perception
must
immediately
and
directly
lead
to
a
further
perception
the
creator
trusts
his
intuition
to
lead
him
along
a
path
that
has
internal
validity
because
it
mirrors
the
reality
of
his
experience
he
disdains
external
restrictions
conventional
syntax
traditional
metre
the
unit
of
form
is
determined
subjectively
the
heart
by
the
way
of
the
breath
to
the
line
the
test
of
form
is
fidelity
to
the
experience
a
gauge
also
accepted
by
the
abstract
expressionist
painters
an
earlier
but
still
influential
school
of
painting
surrealism
had
suggested
the
way
of
dealing
with
the
dream
experience
that
event
in
which
seemingly
incongruous
objects
are
linked
together
through
the
curious
associations
of
the
subconscious
the
resulting
picture
might
appear
a
maze
of
restless
confusions
and
contradictions
but
it
is
more
true
to
life
than
a
portrait
of
an
artificially
contrived
order
the
contemporary
painter
tends
to
depict
not
the
concrete
objects
of
his
experience
but
their
essences
as
revealed
in
abstractions
of
their
lines
colors
masses
and
energies
he
is
still
concerned
however
with
a
personal
event
he
accepts
the
accidents
of
his
brushwork
because
they
provide
evidence
of
the
vitality
of
the
experience
of
creation
the
work
must
be
true
to
both
the
physical
and
the
spiritual
character
of
the
experience
some
painters
have
less
interest
in
the
experience
of
the
moment
with
its
attendant
urgencies
and
ambiguities
than
in
looking
beyond
the
flux
of
particular
impressions
to
a
higher
more
serene
level
of
truth
rather
than
putting
their
trust
in
ephemeral
sensations
they
seek
form
in
the
stable
relationships
of
pure
design
which
symbolize
an
order
more
real
than
the
disorder
of
the
perceptual
world
the
concept
remains
subjective
but
in
this
approach
it
is
the
artist
s
ultimate
insight
rather
than
his
immediate
impressions
that
gives
form
to
the
work
others
look
to
more
objective
devices
of
order
the
musician
employing
the
serial
technique
of
composition
establishes
a
mathematical
system
of
rotations
that
once
set
in
motion
determines
the
sequence
of
pitches
and
even
of
rhythms
and
intensities
the
composer
may
reverse
or
invert
the
order
of
his
original
set
of
intervals
or
rhythms
or
dynamic
changes
he
may
even
alter
the
pattern
by
applying
a
scheme
of
random
numbers
but
he
can
not
order
his
elements
by
will
either
rational
or
inspired
the
system
works
as
an
impersonal
mechanism
musicians
who
use
the
chance
method
also
exclude
subjective
control
of
formal
development
again
the
composer
must
select
his
own
materials
but
a
tossing
of
coins
with
perhaps
the
added
safeguard
of
reference
to
the
oracles
of
the
i
ching
the
chinese
book
of
changes
dictates
the
handling
of
the
chosen
materials
avant
garde
choreographers
seeking
new
forms
of
continuity
for
their
new
vocabulary
of
movements
have
turned
to
similar
approaches
some
let
dances
take
their
form
from
the
experience
of
creation
according
to
katherine
litz
the
becoming
the
process
of
realization
is
the
dance
the
process
stipulates
that
the
choreographer
sense
the
quality
of
the
initial
movement
he
has
discovered
and
that
he
feel
the
rightness
of
the
quality
that
is
to
follow
it
the
sequence
may
involve
a
sharp
contrast
for
example
a
quiet
meditative
sway
of
the
body
succeeded
by
a
violent
leap
or
it
may
involve
more
subtle
distinctions
the
sway
may
be
gradually
minimized
or
enlarged
its
rhythmic
emphasis
may
be
slightly
modified
or
it
may
be
transferred
to
become
a
movement
of
only
the
arms
or
the
head
even
the
least
alteration
will
change
the
quality
an
exploration
of
these
possible
relationships
constitutes
the
process
of
creation
and
thereby
gives
form
to
the
dance
the
approach
to
the
depiction
of
the
experience
of
creation
may
be
analytic
as
it
is
for
miss
litz
or
spontaneous
as
it
is
for
merle
marsicano
she
too
is
concerned
with
the
becoming
the
process
of
realization
but
she
does
not
think
in
terms
of
subtle
variations
of
spatial
or
temporal
patterns
the
design
is
determined
emotionally
i
must
reach
into
myself
for
the
spring
that
will
send
me
catapulting
recklessly
into
the
chaos
of
event
with
which
the
dance
confronts
me
looking
back
miss
marsicano
feels
that
her
ideas
may
have
been
influenced
by
those
of
jackson
pollock
at
one
time
she
felt
impelled
to
make
dances
that
moved
all
over
the
stage
much
as
pollock
s
paintings
move
violently
over
the
full
extent
of
the
canvas
but
her
conscious
need
was
to
break
away
from
constricting
patterns
of
form
a
need
to
let
the
experience
shape
itself
midi
garth
also
believes
in
subjective
continuity
that
begins
with
the
feeling
engendered
by
an
initial
movement
it
may
be
a
free
front
back
swing
of
the
leg
leading
to
a
sideways
swing
of
the
arm
that
develops
into
a
turn
and
the
sensation
of
taking
off
from
the
ground
this
became
a
dance
called
prelude
to
flight
a
pervading
quality
of
free
lyricism
and
a
building
from
turns
close
to
the
ground
towards
jumps
into
the
air
gives
the
work
its
central
focus
alwin
nikolais
objects
to
art
as
an
outpouring
of
personal
emotion
he
seeks
to
make
his
dancers
more
godlike
by
relating
them
to
the
impersonal
elements
of
shape
light
color
and
sound
if
his
dancers
are
sometimes
made
to
look
as
if
they
might
be
creatures
from
mars
this
is
consistent
with
his
intention
of
placing
them
in
the
orbit
of
another
world
a
world
in
which
they
are
freed
of
their
pedestrian
identities
it
is
through
the
metamorphosed
dancer
that
the
germ
of
form
is
discovered
in
his
recognition
of
his
impersonal
self
the
dancer
moves
and
this
self
in
the
first
revealed
stroke
of
its
existence
states
the
theme
from
which
all
else
must
follow
the
theme
may
be
the
formation
of
a
shape
from
which
other
shapes
evolve
it
may
be
a
reaction
to
a
percussive
sound
the
following
movements
constituting
further
reactions
it
may
establish
the
relation
of
the
figure
of
the
dancer
to
light
and
color
in
which
case
changes
in
the
light
or
color
will
set
off
a
kaleidescope
of
visual
designs
unconcerned
with
the
practical
function
of
his
actions
the
dancer
is
engrossed
exclusively
in
their
motional
content
movements
unfold
freely
because
they
are
uninhibited
by
emotional
bias
or
purposive
drive
but
the
metamorphosis
must
come
first
though
he
is
also
concerned
with
freeing
dance
from
pedestrian
modes
of
activity
merce
cunningham
has
selected
a
very
different
method
for
achieving
his
aim
he
rejects
all
subjectively
motivated
continuity
any
line
of
action
related
to
the
concept
of
cause
and
effect
he
bases
his
approach
on
the
belief
that
anything
can
follow
anything
an
order
can
be
chanced
rather
than
chosen
and
this
approach
produces
an
experience
that
is
free
and
discovered
rather
than
bound
and
remembered
thus
there
is
freshness
not
only
in
the
individual
movements
of
the
dance
but
in
the
shape
of
their
continuity
as
well
chance
he
finds
enables
him
to
create
a
world
beyond
imagination
he
cites
with
pleasure
the
comment
of
a
lady
who
exclaimed
after
a
concert
why
it
s
extremely
interesting
but
i
would
never
have
thought
of
it
myself
the
sequence
of
movements
in
a
cunningham
dance
is
unlike
any
sequence
to
be
seen
in
life
at
one
side
of
the
stage
a
dancer
jumps
excitedly
nearby
another
sits
motionless
while
still
another
is
twirling
an
umbrella
a
man
and
a
girl
happen
to
meet
they
look
straight
at
the
audience
not
at
each
other
he
lifts
her
puts
her
down
and
walks
off
neither
pleased
nor
disturbed
as
if
nothing
had
happened
if
one
dancer
slaps
another
the
victim
may
do
a
pirouette
sit
down
or
offer
his
assailant
a
fork
and
spoon
events
occur
without
apparent
reason
their
consequences
are
irrelevant
or
there
are
no
consequences
at
all
the
sequence
is
determined
by
chance
and
mr
cunningham
makes
use
of
any
one
of
several
chance
devices
he
may
toss
coins
he
may
take
slips
of
paper
from
a
grab
bag
the
answers
derived
by
these
means
may
determine
not
only
the
temporal
organization
of
the
dance
but
also
its
spatial
design
special
slips
designating
the
location
on
the
stage
where
the
movement
is
to
be
performed
the
other
variables
include
the
dancer
who
is
to
perform
the
movement
and
the
length
of
time
he
is
to
take
in
its
performance
the
only
factors
that
are
personally
set
by
the
choreographer
are
the
movements
themselves
the
number
of
the
dancers
and
the
approximate
total
duration
of
the
dance
the
approximate
is
important
because
even
after
the
order
of
the
work
has
been
established
by
the
chance
method
the
result
is
not
inviolable
each
performance
may
be
different
if
a
work
is
divided
into
several
large
segments
a
last
minute
drawing
of
random
numbers
may
determine
the
order
of
the
segments
for
any
particular
performance
and
any
sequence
can
not
only
change
its
positions
in
the
work
but
can
even
be
eliminated
from
it
altogether
mr
cunningham
tries
not
to
cheat
the
chance
method
he
adheres
to
its
dictates
as
faithfully
as
he
can
however
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
chance
will
make
demands
the
dancers
find
impossible
to
execute
then
the
choreographer
must
arbitrate
he
must
rearrange
matters
so
that
two
performers
do
not
bump
into
each
other
he
must
construct
transitions
so
that
a
dancer
who
is
told
to
lie
prone
one
second
and
to
leap
wildly
the
next
will
have
some
physical
preparation
for
the
leap
the
north
and
the
south
were
in
greater
agreement
on
sovereignty
through
all
their
dispute
about
it
than
were
the
founding
fathers
the
truth
in
their
conflicting
concepts
was
expounded
by
statesmen
of
the
calibre
of
webster
and
calhoun
and
defended
in
the
end
by
leaders
of
the
nobility
of
lincoln
and
lee
the
people
everywhere
had
grown
meanwhile
in
devotion
to
basic
democratic
principles
in
understanding
of
and
belief
in
the
federal
balance
and
in
love
of
their
union
repeated
efforts
beginning
with
the
missouri
compromise
of
were
made
by
such
master
moderates
as
clay
and
douglas
to
resolve
the
difference
peacefully
by
compromise
rather
than
clear
thought
and
timely
action
even
so
confusion
in
this
period
gained
such
strength
from
compromise
and
other
factors
that
it
led
to
the
bloodiest
war
of
the
nineteenth
century
nothing
can
show
more
than
this
the
immensity
of
the
danger
to
democratic
peoples
that
lies
in
even
relatively
slight
deviation
from
their
true
concept
of
sovereignty
the
present
issue
in
atlantica
whether
to
transform
an
alliance
of
sovereign
nations
into
a
federal
union
of
sovereign
citizens
resembles
the
american
one
of
rather
than
the
one
that
was
resolved
by
civil
war
and
so
i
would
only
touch
upon
it
now
much
as
i
have
long
wanted
to
write
a
book
about
it
i
think
it
is
essential
however
to
pinpoint
here
the
difference
between
the
two
concepts
of
sovereignty
that
went
to
war
in
if
only
to
see
better
how
imperative
is
our
need
today
to
clarify
completely
our
far
worse
confusion
on
this
subject
the
difference
came
down
to
this
the
southern
states
insisted
that
the
united
states
was
in
last
analysis
what
its
name
implied
a
union
of
states
to
their
leaders
the
constitution
was
a
compact
made
by
the
people
of
sovereign
states
who
therefore
retained
the
right
to
secede
from
it
this
right
of
the
state
its
upholders
contended
was
essential
to
maintain
the
federal
balance
and
protect
the
liberty
of
the
people
from
the
danger
of
centralizing
power
in
the
union
government
the
champions
of
the
union
maintained
that
the
constitution
had
formed
fundamentally
the
united
people
of
america
that
it
was
a
compact
among
sovereign
citizens
rather
than
states
and
that
therefore
the
states
had
no
right
to
secede
though
the
citizens
could
writing
to
speed
on
august
lincoln
made
the
latter
point
clear
in
homely
terms
whose
timeliness
is
startling
today
he
thus
declared
his
own
right
to
secede
we
began
by
declaring
that
all
men
are
created
equal
we
now
practically
read
it
all
men
are
created
equal
except
negroes
when
the
know
nothings
get
control
it
will
read
all
men
are
created
equal
except
negroes
and
foreigners
and
catholics
when
it
comes
to
this
i
shall
prefer
emigrating
to
some
country
where
they
make
no
pretence
of
loving
liberty
to
russia
for
instance
where
despotism
can
be
taken
pure
without
the
base
alloy
of
hypocrisy
his
emphasis
when
the
southern
states
exercised
their
right
to
secede
they
formed
what
they
officially
styled
the
confederate
states
of
america
dictionaries
as
we
have
seen
still
cite
this
government
along
with
the
articles
of
confederation
of
as
an
example
of
a
confederacy
the
fact
is
that
the
southern
confederacy
differed
from
the
earlier
one
almost
as
much
as
the
federal
constitution
did
the
confederate
constitution
copied
much
of
the
federal
constitution
verbatim
and
most
of
the
rest
in
substance
it
operated
on
by
and
for
the
people
individually
just
as
did
the
federal
constitution
it
made
substantially
the
same
division
of
power
between
the
central
and
state
governments
and
among
the
executive
legislative
and
judicial
branches
the
difference
between
confederacy
and
federal
union
in
many
believe
and
understandably
that
the
great
difference
between
the
constitution
of
the
southern
confederacy
and
the
federal
constitution
was
that
the
former
recognized
the
right
of
each
state
to
secede
but
though
each
of
its
members
had
asserted
this
right
against
the
union
the
final
constitution
which
the
confederacy
signed
on
march
nearly
a
month
before
hostilities
began
included
no
explicit
provision
authorizing
a
state
to
secede
its
drafters
discussed
this
vital
point
but
left
it
out
of
their
constitution
their
president
jefferson
davis
interpreted
their
constitution
to
mean
that
it
admits
of
no
coerced
association
but
this
reremained
so
doubtful
that
there
were
frequent
demands
that
the
right
to
secede
be
put
into
the
constitution
the
constitution
of
the
southern
confederation
differed
from
that
of
the
federal
union
only
in
two
important
respects
it
openly
defiantly
recognized
slavery
an
institution
which
the
southerners
of
even
though
they
continued
it
found
so
impossible
to
reconcile
with
freedom
that
they
carefully
avoided
mentioning
the
word
in
the
federal
constitution
they
recognized
that
slavery
was
a
moral
issue
and
not
merely
an
economic
interest
and
that
to
recognize
it
explicitly
in
their
constitution
would
be
in
explosive
contradiction
to
the
concept
of
sovereignty
they
had
set
forth
in
the
declaration
of
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
unalienable
rights
that
among
them
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
the
other
important
difference
between
the
two
constitutions
was
that
the
president
of
the
confederacy
held
office
for
six
instead
of
four
years
and
was
limited
to
one
term
these
are
not
however
differences
in
federal
structure
the
only
important
differences
from
that
standpoint
between
the
two
constitutions
lies
in
their
preambles
the
one
of
made
clear
that
in
making
their
government
the
people
were
acting
through
their
states
whereas
the
preamble
of
expressed
as
clearly
as
language
can
the
opposite
concept
that
they
were
acting
directly
as
citizens
here
are
the
two
preambles
federal
constitution
we
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
order
to
form
a
more
perfect
union
establish
justice
insure
domestic
tranquility
provide
for
the
common
defence
promote
the
general
welfare
and
secure
the
blessings
of
liberty
to
ourselves
and
our
posterity
do
ordain
and
establish
this
constitution
for
the
united
states
of
america
confederate
constitution
we
the
people
of
the
confederate
states
each
state
acting
in
its
sovereign
and
independent
character
in
order
to
form
a
permanent
federal
government
establish
justice
insure
domestic
tranquility
and
secure
the
blessings
of
liberty
to
ourselves
and
our
posterity
invoking
the
favor
and
the
guidance
of
almighty
god
do
ordain
and
establish
this
constitution
for
the
confederate
states
of
america
one
is
tempted
to
say
that
on
the
difference
between
the
concepts
of
sovereignty
in
these
two
preambles
the
worst
war
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
fought
but
though
the
southern
states
when
drafting
a
constitution
to
unite
themselves
narrowed
the
difference
to
this
fine
point
by
omitting
to
assert
the
right
to
secede
the
fact
remained
that
by
seceding
from
the
union
they
had
already
acted
on
the
concept
that
it
was
composed
primarily
of
sovereign
states
if
the
union
conceded
this
to
them
the
same
right
must
be
conceded
to
each
remaining
state
whenever
it
saw
fit
to
secede
this
would
destroy
the
federal
balance
between
it
and
the
states
and
in
the
end
sacrifice
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
all
the
liberty
the
citizens
had
gained
by
their
union
lincoln
saw
that
the
act
of
secession
made
the
issue
for
the
union
a
vital
one
whether
it
was
a
union
of
sovereign
citizens
that
should
continue
to
live
or
an
association
of
sovereign
states
that
must
fall
prey
either
to
anarchy
or
despotism
much
as
he
abhorred
slavery
lincoln
was
always
willing
to
concede
to
each
slave
state
the
right
to
decide
independently
whether
to
continue
or
end
it
though
his
election
was
interpreted
by
many
southerners
as
the
forerunner
of
a
dangerous
shift
in
the
federal
balance
in
favor
of
the
union
lincoln
himself
proposed
no
such
change
in
the
rights
the
constitution
gave
the
states
after
the
war
began
he
long
refused
to
permit
emancipation
of
the
slaves
by
union
action
even
in
the
border
states
that
stayed
with
the
union
he
issued
his
emancipation
proclamation
only
when
he
felt
that
necessity
left
him
no
other
way
to
save
the
union
in
his
message
of
december
he
put
his
purpose
and
his
policy
in
these
words
which
i
would
call
the
lincoln
law
of
liberty
and
union
in
giving
freedom
to
the
slave
we
assure
freedom
to
the
free
what
lincoln
could
not
concede
was
that
the
states
rather
than
the
people
were
sovereign
in
the
union
he
fought
to
the
end
to
preserve
it
as
a
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
for
the
people
the
truth
on
each
side
won
in
the
civil
war
the
fact
that
the
americans
who
upheld
the
sovereignty
of
their
states
did
this
in
order
to
keep
many
of
their
people
more
securely
in
slavery
the
antithesis
of
individual
liberty
made
the
conflict
grimmer
and
the
greater
out
of
this
ordeal
the
citizen
emerged
in
the
south
as
in
the
north
as
america
s
true
sovereign
in
a
new
birth
of
freedom
as
lincoln
promised
but
before
this
came
about
americans
had
given
their
lives
in
battle
for
the
two
concepts
of
the
sovereign
rights
of
men
and
of
states
on
their
decisive
battlefield
lincoln
did
not
distinguish
between
them
when
he
paid
tribute
to
the
brave
men
living
and
dead
who
fought
here
he
understood
that
both
sides
were
at
fault
and
he
reached
the
height
of
saying
so
explicitly
in
his
second
inaugural
to
my
knowledge
lincoln
remains
the
only
head
of
state
and
commander
in
chief
who
while
fighting
a
fearful
war
whose
issue
was
in
doubt
proved
man
enough
to
say
this
publicly
to
give
his
foe
the
benefit
of
the
fact
that
in
all
human
truth
there
is
some
error
and
in
all
our
error
some
truth
so
great
a
man
could
not
but
understand
too
that
the
thing
that
moves
men
to
sacrifice
their
lives
is
not
the
error
of
their
thought
which
their
opponents
see
and
attack
but
the
truth
which
the
latter
do
not
see
any
more
than
they
see
the
error
which
mars
the
truth
they
themselves
defend
it
is
much
less
difficult
now
than
in
lincoln
s
day
to
see
that
on
both
sides
sovereign
americans
had
given
their
lives
in
the
civil
war
to
maintain
the
balance
between
the
powers
they
had
delegated
to
the
states
and
to
their
union
they
differed
in
the
balance
they
believed
essential
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
citizen
but
the
supreme
sacrifice
each
made
served
to
maintain
a
still
more
fundamental
truth
that
individual
life
liberty
and
happiness
depend
on
a
right
balance
between
the
two
and
on
the
limitation
of
sovereignty
in
all
its
aspects
which
this
involves
the
americans
who
gave
the
last
full
measure
of
devotion
to
prevent
disunion
preserved
individual
freedom
in
the
united
states
from
the
dangers
of
anarchy
inherent
in
confederations
which
throughout
history
have
proved
fatal
in
the
end
to
all
associations
composed
primarily
of
sovereign
states
and
to
the
liberties
of
their
people
but
the
fact
that
other
americans
gave
the
same
measure
of
devotion
to
an
opposing
concept
served
liberty
and
union
in
other
essential
ways
its
appeal
from
ballots
to
bullets
at
fort
sumter
ended
by
costing
the
southerners
their
right
to
have
slaves
a
right
that
was
even
less
compatible
with
the
sovereignty
of
man
the
very
fact
that
they
came
so
near
to
winning
by
the
wrong
method
war
led
directly
to
their
losing
both
the
war
and
the
wrong
thing
they
fought
for
since
it
forced
lincoln
to
free
their
slaves
as
a
military
measure
there
was
a
divine
justice
in
one
wrong
thus
undoing
another
there
was
also
a
lesson
one
that
has
served
ever
since
to
keep
americans
in
their
conflicts
with
one
another
from
turning
from
the
ballot
to
the
bullet
yet
though
the
southern
states
lost
the
worst
errors
in
their
case
they
did
not
lose
the
truth
they
fought
for
the
lives
so
many
of
them
gave
to
forestall
what
they
believed
would
be
a
fatal
encroachment
by
the
union
on
the
powers
reserved
to
their
states
have
continued
ever
since
to
safeguard
all
americans
against
freedom
s
other
foe
as
cells
coalesced
into
organisms
they
built
new
unnatural
and
internally
controlled
environments
to
cope
even
more
successfully
with
the
entropy
increasing
properties
of
the
external
world
the
useful
suggestion
of
professor
david
hawkins
which
considers
culture
as
a
third
stage
in
biological
evolution
fits
quite
beautifully
then
with
our
suggestion
that
science
has
provided
us
with
a
rather
successful
technique
for
building
protective
artificial
environments
one
wonders
about
its
applicability
to
people
will
advances
in
human
sciences
help
us
build
social
structures
and
governments
which
will
enable
us
to
cope
with
people
as
effectively
as
the
primitive
combination
of
protein
and
nucleic
acid
built
a
structure
of
molecules
which
enabled
it
to
adapt
to
a
sea
of
molecular
interaction
the
answer
is
of
course
yes
for
the
family
is
the
simplest
example
of
just
such
a
unit
composed
of
people
which
gives
us
both
some
immunity
from
and
a
way
of
dealing
with
other
people
social
invention
did
not
have
to
await
social
theory
any
more
than
use
of
the
warmth
of
a
fire
had
to
await
lavoisier
or
the
buoyant
protection
of
a
boat
the
formulations
of
archimedes
but
it
has
been
during
the
last
two
centuries
during
the
scientific
revolution
that
our
independence
from
the
physical
environment
has
made
the
most
rapid
strides
we
have
ample
light
when
the
sun
sets
the
temperature
of
our
homes
is
independent
of
the
seasons
we
fly
through
the
air
although
gravity
pulls
us
down
the
range
of
our
voice
ignores
distance
at
what
stage
are
social
sciences
then
is
the
future
of
psychology
akin
to
the
rich
future
of
physics
at
the
time
of
newton
there
is
a
haunting
resemblance
between
the
notion
of
cause
in
copernicus
and
in
freud
and
it
is
certainly
no
slight
to
either
of
them
to
compare
both
their
achievements
and
their
impact
political
theoretical
understanding
although
almost
at
a
standstill
during
this
century
did
develop
during
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
and
resulted
in
a
flood
of
inventions
which
increased
the
possibility
for
man
to
coexist
with
man
consitutional
government
popular
vote
trial
by
jury
public
education
labor
unions
cooperatives
communes
socialized
ownership
world
courts
and
the
veto
power
in
world
councils
are
but
a
few
examples
most
of
these
with
horrible
exceptions
were
conceived
as
is
a
ship
not
as
an
attempt
to
quell
the
ocean
of
mankind
nor
to
deny
its
force
but
as
a
means
to
survive
and
enjoy
it
the
most
effective
political
inventions
seem
to
make
maximum
use
of
natural
harbors
and
are
aware
that
restraining
breakwaters
can
play
only
a
minor
part
in
the
whole
scheme
just
as
present
technology
had
to
await
the
explanations
of
physics
so
one
might
expect
that
social
invention
will
follow
growing
sociological
understanding
we
are
desperately
in
the
need
of
such
invention
for
man
is
still
very
much
at
the
mercy
of
man
in
fact
the
accumulation
of
the
hardware
of
destruction
is
day
by
day
increasing
our
fear
of
each
other
iii
i
want
therefore
to
discuss
a
second
and
quite
different
fruit
of
science
the
connection
between
scientific
understanding
and
fear
there
are
certainly
large
areas
of
understanding
in
the
human
sciences
which
in
themselves
and
even
without
political
invention
can
help
to
dispel
our
present
fears
lucretius
has
remarked
the
reason
why
all
mortals
are
so
gripped
by
fear
is
that
they
see
all
sorts
of
things
happening
in
the
earth
and
sky
with
no
discernable
cause
and
these
they
attribute
to
the
will
of
god
perhaps
things
were
even
worse
then
it
is
difficult
to
reconstruct
the
primeval
fears
of
man
we
get
some
clue
from
a
few
remembrances
of
childhood
and
from
the
circumstance
that
we
are
probably
not
much
more
afraid
of
people
now
than
man
ever
was
we
are
not
now
afraid
of
atomic
bombs
in
the
same
way
that
people
once
feared
comets
the
bombs
are
as
harmless
as
an
automobile
in
a
garage
we
are
worried
about
what
people
may
do
with
them
that
some
crazy
fool
may
push
the
button
i
am
certainly
not
adequately
trained
to
describe
or
enlarge
on
human
fears
but
there
are
certain
features
of
the
fears
dispelled
by
scientific
explanations
that
stand
out
quite
clearly
they
are
in
general
those
fears
that
once
seemed
to
have
been
amenable
to
prayer
or
ritual
they
include
both
individual
fears
and
collective
ones
they
arise
in
situations
in
which
one
believes
that
what
happens
depends
not
only
on
the
external
world
but
also
on
the
precise
pattern
of
behavior
of
the
individual
or
group
often
it
is
recognized
that
all
the
details
of
the
pattern
may
not
be
essential
to
the
outcome
but
because
the
pattern
was
empirically
determined
and
not
developed
through
theoretical
understanding
one
is
never
quite
certain
which
behavior
elements
are
effective
and
the
whole
pattern
becomes
ritualized
yet
often
fear
persists
because
even
with
the
most
rigid
ritual
one
is
never
quite
free
from
the
uneasy
feeling
that
one
might
make
some
mistake
or
that
in
every
previous
execution
one
had
been
unaware
of
the
really
decisive
act
to
say
that
science
had
reduced
many
such
fears
merely
reiterates
the
obvious
and
frequent
statement
that
science
eliminated
much
of
magic
and
superstition
but
a
somewhat
more
detailed
analysis
of
this
process
may
be
illuminating
the
frequently
postulated
antique
worry
that
the
daylight
hours
might
dwindle
to
complete
darkness
apparently
gave
rise
to
a
ritual
and
celebration
which
we
still
recognize
it
is
curious
that
even
centuries
of
repetition
of
the
yearly
cycle
did
not
induce
a
sufficient
degree
of
confidence
to
allow
people
to
abandon
the
ceremonies
of
the
winter
solstice
this
and
other
fears
of
the
solar
system
have
disappeared
gradually
first
with
the
ptolemaic
system
and
its
built
in
concept
of
periodicity
and
then
more
firmly
with
the
newtonian
innovation
of
an
universal
force
that
could
account
quantitatively
for
both
terrestial
and
celestial
motions
this
understanding
provides
a
very
simple
example
of
the
fact
that
one
can
eliminate
fear
without
instituting
any
controls
in
fact
although
we
have
dispelled
the
fear
we
have
not
necessarily
assured
ourselves
that
there
are
no
dangers
there
is
still
the
remote
possibility
of
planetoid
collision
a
meteor
could
fall
on
san
francisco
solar
activities
could
presumably
bring
long
periods
of
flood
or
drought
our
understanding
of
the
solar
system
has
taught
us
to
replace
our
former
elaborate
rituals
with
the
appropriate
action
which
in
this
case
amounts
to
doing
nothing
yet
we
no
longer
feel
uneasy
this
almost
trivial
example
is
nevertheless
suggestive
for
there
are
some
elements
in
common
between
the
antique
fear
that
the
days
would
get
shorter
and
shorter
and
our
present
fear
of
war
we
in
our
country
think
of
war
as
an
external
threat
which
if
it
occurs
will
not
be
primarily
of
our
own
doing
and
yet
we
obviously
also
believe
that
the
avoidance
of
the
disaster
depends
in
some
obscure
or
at
least
uncertain
way
on
the
details
of
how
we
behave
what
elements
of
our
behavior
are
decisive
our
weapons
production
our
world
prestige
our
ideas
of
democracy
our
actions
of
trust
or
stubbornness
or
secrecy
or
espionage
we
have
staved
off
a
war
and
since
our
behavior
has
involved
all
these
elements
we
can
only
keep
adding
to
our
ritual
without
daring
to
abandon
any
part
of
it
since
we
have
not
the
slightest
notion
which
parts
are
effective
i
think
that
we
are
here
also
talking
of
the
kind
of
fear
that
a
young
boy
has
for
a
group
of
boys
who
are
approaching
at
night
along
the
streets
of
a
large
city
if
an
automobile
were
approaching
him
he
would
know
what
was
required
of
him
even
though
he
might
not
be
able
to
act
quickly
enough
with
the
group
of
boys
it
is
different
he
does
not
know
whether
to
look
up
or
look
aside
to
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
or
to
clench
them
at
his
side
to
cross
the
street
or
to
continue
on
the
same
side
when
confronted
with
a
drunk
or
an
insane
person
i
have
no
notion
of
what
any
one
of
them
might
do
to
me
or
to
himself
or
to
others
i
believe
that
what
i
do
has
some
effect
on
his
actions
and
i
have
learned
in
a
way
to
commune
with
drunks
but
certainly
my
actions
seem
to
resemble
more
nearly
the
performance
of
a
rain
dance
than
the
carrying
out
of
an
experiment
in
physics
i
am
usually
filled
with
an
uneasiness
that
through
some
unwitting
slip
all
hell
may
break
loose
our
inability
to
explain
why
certain
people
are
fond
of
us
frequently
induces
the
same
kind
of
ritual
and
malaise
we
are
forced
in
our
behavior
towards
others
to
adopt
empirically
successful
patterns
in
toto
because
we
have
such
a
minimal
understanding
of
their
essential
elements
our
collective
policies
group
and
national
are
similarly
based
on
voodoo
but
here
we
often
lack
even
the
empirically
successful
rituals
and
are
still
engaged
in
determing
them
we
use
terms
from
our
personal
experience
with
individuals
such
as
trust
cheat
and
get
tough
we
talk
about
national
character
in
the
same
way
that
copernicus
talked
of
the
compulsions
of
celestial
bodies
to
move
in
circles
we
perform
elaborate
international
exhortations
and
ceremonies
with
virtually
no
understanding
of
social
cause
and
effect
small
wonder
then
that
we
fear
the
achievements
which
dispelled
our
fears
of
the
cosmos
took
place
three
centuries
ago
what
additional
roles
has
the
scientific
understanding
of
the
th
and
th
centuries
played
in
the
physical
sciences
these
achievements
concern
electricity
chemistry
and
atomic
physics
in
the
life
sciences
there
has
been
an
enormous
increase
in
our
understanding
of
disease
in
the
mechanisms
of
heredity
and
in
bio
and
physiological
chemistry
the
major
effect
of
these
advances
appears
to
lie
in
the
part
they
have
played
in
the
industrial
revolution
and
in
the
tools
which
scientific
understanding
has
given
us
to
build
and
manipulate
a
more
protective
environment
in
addition
our
way
of
dealing
directly
with
natural
phenomena
has
also
changed
even
in
domains
where
detailed
and
predictive
understanding
is
still
lacking
but
where
some
explanations
are
possible
as
with
lightning
and
weather
and
earthquakes
the
appropriate
kind
of
human
action
has
been
more
adequately
indicated
apparently
the
population
as
a
whole
eventually
acquires
enough
confidence
in
the
explanations
of
the
scientists
to
modify
its
procedures
and
its
fears
how
and
why
this
process
occurs
would
provide
an
interesting
separate
subject
for
study
in
some
areas
the
progress
is
slower
than
in
others
in
agriculture
for
example
despite
the
advances
in
biology
elaborate
rituals
tend
to
persist
along
with
a
continued
sense
of
the
imminence
of
some
natural
disaster
in
child
care
the
opposite
extreme
prevails
procedures
change
rapidly
and
parental
confidence
probably
exceeds
anything
warranted
by
established
psychological
theory
there
are
many
domains
in
which
understanding
has
brought
about
widespread
and
quite
appropriate
reduction
in
ritual
and
fear
much
of
the
former
extreme
uneasiness
associated
with
visions
and
hallucinations
and
with
death
has
disappeared
the
persistent
horror
of
having
a
malformed
child
has
i
believe
been
reduced
not
because
we
have
gained
any
control
over
this
misfortune
but
precisely
because
we
have
learned
that
we
have
so
little
control
over
it
in
fact
the
recent
warnings
about
the
use
of
x
rays
have
introduced
fears
and
ambiguities
of
action
which
now
require
more
detailed
understanding
and
thus
in
this
instance
science
has
momentarily
aggravated
our
fears
in
fact
insofar
as
science
generates
any
fear
it
stems
not
so
much
from
scientific
prowess
and
gadgets
but
from
the
fact
that
new
unanswered
questions
arise
which
until
they
are
understood
create
uncertainty
perhaps
the
most
illuminating
example
of
the
reduction
of
fear
through
understanding
is
derived
from
our
increased
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
disease
the
situation
with
regard
to
our
attitude
and
control
of
disease
contains
close
analogies
to
problems
confronting
us
with
respect
to
people
the
fear
of
disease
was
formerly
very
much
the
kind
of
fear
i
have
tried
to
describe
nothing
like
godot
he
arrived
before
the
hour
his
letter
had
suggested
we
meet
at
my
hotel
at
noon
on
sunday
and
i
came
into
the
lobby
as
the
clock
struck
twelve
he
was
waiting
my
wish
to
meet
samuel
beckett
had
been
prompted
by
simple
curiosity
and
interest
in
his
work
american
newspaper
reviewers
like
to
call
his
plays
nihilistic
they
find
deep
pessimism
in
them
even
so
astute
a
commentator
as
harold
clurman
of
the
nation
has
said
that
waiting
for
godot
is
the
concentrate
of
the
contemporary
european
mood
of
despair
but
to
me
beckett
s
writing
had
seemed
permeated
with
love
for
human
beings
and
with
a
kind
of
humor
that
i
could
reconcile
neither
with
despair
nor
with
nihilism
could
it
be
that
my
own
eyes
and
ears
had
deceived
me
is
his
a
literature
of
defeat
irrelevant
to
the
social
crises
we
face
or
is
it
relevant
because
it
teaches
us
something
useful
to
know
about
ourselves
i
knew
that
a
conversation
with
the
author
would
not
settle
such
questions
because
a
man
is
not
the
same
as
his
writing
in
the
last
analysis
the
questions
had
to
be
settled
by
the
work
itself
nevertheless
i
was
curious
my
curiosity
was
sharpened
a
day
or
two
before
the
interview
by
a
conversation
i
had
with
a
well
informed
teacher
of
literature
a
jesuit
father
at
a
conference
on
religious
drama
near
paris
when
beckett
s
name
came
into
the
discussion
the
priest
grew
loud
and
told
me
that
beckett
hates
life
that
i
thought
is
at
least
one
thing
i
can
find
out
when
we
meet
beckett
s
appearance
is
rough
hewn
irish
the
features
of
his
face
are
distinct
but
not
fine
they
look
as
if
they
had
been
sculptured
with
an
unsharpened
chisel
unruly
hair
goes
straight
up
from
his
forehead
standing
so
high
that
the
top
falls
gently
over
as
if
to
show
that
it
really
is
hair
and
not
bristle
one
might
say
it
combines
the
man
s
own
pride
and
humility
for
he
has
the
pride
that
comes
of
self
acceptance
and
the
humility
perhaps
of
the
same
genesis
not
to
impose
himself
upon
another
his
light
blue
eyes
set
deep
within
the
face
are
actively
and
continually
looking
he
seems
by
some
unconscious
division
of
labor
to
have
given
them
that
one
function
and
no
other
leaving
communication
to
the
rest
of
the
face
the
mouth
frequently
breaks
into
a
disarming
smile
the
voice
is
light
in
timbre
with
a
rough
edge
that
corresponds
to
his
visage
the
irish
accent
is
as
one
would
expect
combined
with
slight
inflections
from
the
french
his
tweed
suit
was
a
baggy
gray
and
green
he
wore
a
brown
knit
sports
shirt
with
no
tie
we
walked
down
the
rue
de
l
arcade
thence
along
beside
the
madeleine
and
across
to
a
sidewalk
cafe
opposite
that
church
the
conversation
that
ensued
may
have
been
engrossing
but
it
could
hardly
be
called
world
shattering
for
one
thing
the
world
that
beckett
sees
is
already
shattered
his
talk
turns
to
what
he
calls
the
mess
or
sometimes
this
buzzing
confusion
i
reconstruct
his
sentences
from
notes
made
immediately
after
our
conversation
what
appears
here
is
shorter
than
what
he
actually
said
but
very
close
to
his
own
words
the
confusion
is
not
my
invention
we
can
not
listen
to
a
conversation
for
five
minutes
without
being
acutely
aware
of
the
confusion
it
is
all
around
us
and
our
only
chance
now
is
to
let
it
in
the
only
chance
of
renovation
is
to
open
our
eyes
and
see
the
mess
it
is
not
a
mess
you
can
make
sense
of
i
suggested
that
one
must
let
it
in
because
it
is
the
truth
but
beckett
did
not
take
to
the
word
truth
what
is
more
true
than
anything
else
to
swim
is
true
and
to
sink
is
true
one
is
not
more
true
than
the
other
one
can
not
speak
anymore
of
being
one
must
speak
only
of
the
mess
when
heidegger
and
sartre
speak
of
a
contrast
between
being
and
existence
they
may
be
right
i
do
n
t
know
but
their
language
is
too
philosophical
for
me
i
am
not
a
philosopher
one
can
only
speak
of
what
is
in
front
of
him
and
that
now
is
simply
the
mess
then
he
began
to
speak
about
the
tension
in
art
between
the
mess
and
form
until
recently
art
has
withstood
the
pressure
of
chaotic
things
it
has
held
them
at
bay
it
realized
that
to
admit
them
was
to
jeopardize
form
how
could
the
mess
be
admitted
because
it
appears
to
be
the
very
opposite
of
form
and
therefore
destructive
of
the
very
thing
that
art
holds
itself
to
be
but
now
we
can
keep
it
out
no
longer
because
we
have
come
into
a
time
when
it
invades
our
experience
at
every
moment
it
is
there
and
it
must
be
allowed
in
i
granted
this
might
be
so
but
found
the
result
to
be
even
more
attention
to
form
than
was
the
case
previously
and
why
not
how
i
asked
could
chaos
be
admitted
to
chaos
would
not
that
be
the
end
of
thinking
and
the
end
of
art
if
we
look
at
recent
art
we
find
it
preoccupied
with
form
beckett
s
own
work
is
an
example
plays
more
highly
formalized
than
waiting
for
godot
endgame
and
krapp
s
last
tape
would
be
hard
to
find
what
i
am
saying
does
not
mean
that
there
will
henceforth
be
no
form
in
art
it
only
means
that
there
will
be
new
form
and
that
this
form
will
be
of
such
a
type
that
it
admits
the
chaos
and
does
not
try
to
say
that
the
chaos
is
really
something
else
the
form
and
the
chaos
remain
separate
the
latter
is
not
reduced
to
the
former
that
is
why
the
form
itself
becomes
a
preoccupation
because
it
exists
as
a
problem
separate
from
the
material
it
accommodates
to
find
a
form
that
accommodates
the
mess
that
is
the
task
of
the
artist
now
yet
i
responded
could
not
similar
things
be
said
about
the
art
of
the
past
is
it
not
characteristic
of
the
greatest
art
that
it
confronts
us
with
something
we
can
not
clarify
demanding
that
the
viewer
respond
to
it
in
his
own
never
predictable
way
what
is
the
history
of
criticism
but
the
history
of
men
attempting
to
make
sense
of
the
manifold
elements
in
art
that
will
not
allow
themselves
to
be
reduced
to
a
single
philosophy
or
a
single
aesthetic
theory
is
n
t
all
art
ambiguous
not
this
he
said
and
gestured
toward
the
madeleine
the
classical
lines
of
the
church
which
napoleon
thought
of
as
a
temple
of
glory
dominated
all
the
scene
where
we
sat
the
boulevard
de
la
madeleine
the
boulevard
malesherbes
and
the
rue
royale
ran
to
it
with
graceful
flattery
bearing
tidings
of
the
age
of
reason
not
this
this
is
clear
this
does
not
allow
the
mystery
to
invade
us
with
classical
art
all
is
settled
but
it
is
different
at
chartres
there
is
the
unexplainable
and
there
art
raises
questions
that
it
does
not
attempt
to
answer
i
asked
about
the
battle
between
life
and
death
in
his
plays
didi
and
gogo
hover
on
the
edge
of
suicide
hamm
s
world
is
death
and
clov
may
or
may
not
get
out
of
it
to
join
the
living
child
outside
is
this
life
death
question
a
part
of
the
chaos
yes
if
life
and
death
did
not
both
present
themselves
to
us
there
would
be
no
inscrutability
if
there
were
only
darkness
all
would
be
clear
it
is
because
there
is
not
only
darkness
but
also
light
that
our
situation
becomes
inexplicable
take
augustine
s
doctrine
of
grace
given
and
grace
withheld
have
you
pondered
the
dramatic
qualities
in
this
theology
two
thieves
are
crucified
with
christ
one
saved
and
the
other
damned
how
can
we
make
sense
of
this
division
in
classical
drama
such
problems
do
not
arise
the
destiny
of
racine
s
phedre
is
sealed
from
the
beginning
she
will
proceed
into
the
dark
as
she
goes
she
herself
will
be
illuminated
at
the
beginning
of
the
play
she
has
partial
illumination
and
at
the
end
she
has
complete
illumination
but
there
has
been
no
question
but
that
she
moves
toward
the
dark
that
is
the
play
within
this
notion
clarity
is
possible
but
for
us
who
are
neither
greek
nor
jansenist
there
is
not
such
clarity
the
question
would
also
be
removed
if
we
believed
in
the
contrary
total
salvation
but
where
we
have
both
dark
and
light
we
have
also
the
inexplicable
the
key
word
in
my
plays
is
perhaps
given
a
theological
lead
i
asked
what
he
thinks
about
those
who
find
a
religious
significance
to
his
plays
well
really
there
is
none
at
all
i
have
no
religious
feeling
once
i
had
a
religious
emotion
it
was
at
my
first
communion
no
more
my
mother
was
deeply
religious
so
was
my
brother
he
knelt
down
at
his
bed
as
long
as
he
could
kneel
my
father
had
none
the
family
was
protestant
but
for
me
it
was
only
irksome
and
i
let
it
go
my
brother
and
mother
got
no
value
from
their
religion
when
they
died
at
the
moment
of
crisis
it
had
no
more
depth
than
an
old
school
tie
irish
catholicism
is
not
attractive
but
it
is
deeper
when
you
pass
a
church
on
an
irish
bus
all
the
hands
flurry
in
the
sign
of
the
cross
one
day
the
dogs
of
ireland
will
do
that
too
and
perhaps
also
the
pigs
but
do
the
plays
deal
with
the
same
facets
of
experience
religion
must
also
deal
with
yes
for
they
deal
with
distress
some
people
object
to
this
in
my
writing
at
a
party
an
english
intellectual
so
called
asked
me
why
i
write
always
about
distress
as
if
it
were
perverse
to
do
so
he
wanted
to
know
if
my
father
had
beaten
me
or
my
mother
had
run
away
from
home
to
give
me
an
unhappy
childhood
i
told
him
no
that
i
had
had
a
very
happy
childhood
then
he
thought
me
more
perverse
than
ever
i
left
the
party
as
soon
as
possible
and
got
into
a
taxi
on
the
glass
partition
between
me
and
the
driver
were
three
signs
one
asked
for
help
for
the
blind
another
help
for
orphans
and
the
third
for
relief
for
the
war
refugees
one
does
not
have
to
look
for
distress
it
is
screaming
at
you
even
in
the
taxis
of
london
lunch
was
over
and
we
walked
back
to
the
hotel
with
the
light
and
dark
of
paris
screaming
at
us
the
personal
quality
of
samuel
beckett
is
similar
to
qualities
i
had
found
in
the
plays
he
says
nothing
that
compresses
experience
within
a
closed
pattern
perhaps
stands
in
place
of
commitment
at
the
same
time
he
is
plainly
sympathetic
clearly
friendly
if
there
were
only
the
mess
all
would
be
clear
but
there
is
also
compassion
as
a
christian
i
know
i
do
not
stand
where
beckett
stands
but
i
do
see
much
of
what
he
sees
as
a
writer
on
the
theater
i
have
paid
close
attention
to
the
plays
harold
clurman
is
right
to
say
that
waiting
for
godot
is
a
reflection
he
calls
it
a
distorted
reflection
of
the
impasse
and
disarray
of
europe
s
present
politics
ethic
and
common
way
of
life
yet
it
is
not
only
europe
the
play
refers
to
waiting
for
godot
sells
even
better
in
america
than
in
france
the
consciousness
it
mirrors
may
have
come
earlier
to
europe
than
to
america
but
it
is
the
consciousness
that
most
mature
societies
arrive
at
when
their
successes
in
technological
and
economic
systematization
propel
them
into
a
time
of
examining
the
not
strictly
practical
ends
of
culture
america
is
now
joining
europe
in
this
mature
phase
of
development
whether
any
of
us
remain
in
it
long
will
depend
on
what
happens
as
a
result
of
the
technological
and
economic
revolutions
now
going
on
in
the
countries
of
asia
and
africa
and
also
of
course
on
how
long
the
cold
war
remains
cold
even
hemingway
for
all
his
efforts
to
formulate
a
naturalistic
morality
in
the
sun
also
rises
and
a
farewell
to
arms
never
maintained
that
sex
was
all
hemingway
s
fiction
is
supported
by
a
moral
backbone
and
in
its
search
for
ultimate
meaning
hints
at
a
religious
dimension
and
d
h
lawrence
in
fantasia
of
the
unconscious
protested
vehemently
against
the
overestimation
of
the
sexual
motive
though
sex
in
some
form
or
other
enters
into
all
human
activity
and
it
was
a
good
thing
that
freud
emphasized
this
aspect
of
human
nature
it
is
fantastic
to
explain
everything
in
terms
of
sex
all
is
not
sex
declared
lawrence
man
is
not
confined
to
one
outlet
for
his
vital
energy
the
creative
urge
for
example
transcends
the
body
and
the
self
but
for
the
beat
generation
all
is
sex
nothing
is
more
revealing
of
the
way
of
life
and
literary
aspirations
of
this
group
than
their
attitude
toward
sex
for
the
beatnik
like
the
hipster
is
in
opposition
to
a
society
that
is
based
on
the
repression
of
the
sex
instinct
he
has
elevated
sex
not
eros
or
libido
but
pure
spontaneous
uninhibited
sex
to
the
rank
of
the
godhead
it
is
astarte
ishtar
venus
yahwe
dionysus
christ
the
mysterious
and
divine
orgone
energy
flowing
through
the
body
of
the
universe
jazz
is
sex
marijuana
is
a
stimulus
to
sex
the
beat
tempo
is
adjusted
to
the
orgiastic
release
of
the
sexual
impulse
lawrence
lipton
in
the
holy
barbarians
stresses
that
for
the
beat
generation
sex
is
more
than
a
source
of
pleasure
it
is
a
mystique
and
their
private
language
is
rich
in
the
multivalent
ambiguities
of
sexual
reference
so
that
they
dwell
in
a
sexualized
universe
of
discourse
the
singular
uncompromising
force
of
their
revolt
against
the
cult
of
restraint
is
illustrated
by
their
refusal
to
dance
in
a
public
place
the
dance
is
but
a
disguised
ritual
for
the
expression
of
ungratified
sexual
desire
for
this
reason
too
their
language
is
more
forthright
and
earthy
the
beatniks
crave
a
sexual
experience
in
which
their
whole
being
participates
it
is
therefore
not
surprising
that
they
resist
the
lure
of
marriage
and
the
trap
of
domesticity
for
like
cats
they
are
determined
not
to
tame
their
sexual
energy
they
withdraw
to
the
underground
of
the
slums
where
they
can
defy
the
precepts
of
legalized
propriety
unlike
the
heroes
and
flappers
of
the
lost
generation
they
disdain
the
art
of
necking
and
petting
that
is
reserved
for
the
squares
if
they
avoid
the
use
of
the
pungent
outlawed
four
letter
word
it
is
because
it
is
taboo
it
is
sacred
as
lipton
the
prophet
of
the
beat
generation
declares
in
the
sexual
act
the
beat
are
filled
with
mana
the
divine
power
this
is
far
from
the
vulgar
leering
sexuality
of
the
middle
class
square
in
heat
this
is
the
holy
grail
these
knights
of
the
orgasm
pursue
this
is
the
irresistible
cosmic
urge
to
which
they
respond
if
wilhelm
reich
is
the
moses
who
has
led
them
out
of
the
egypt
of
sexual
slavery
dylan
thomas
is
the
poet
who
offers
them
the
dionysian
dialectic
of
justification
for
their
indulgence
in
liquor
marijuana
sex
and
jazz
in
addition
they
have
been
converted
to
zen
buddhism
with
its
glorification
of
all
that
is
natural
and
mysteriously
alive
the
sense
that
everything
in
the
world
is
flowing
thus
paradoxically
the
beat
writers
resort
to
religious
metaphors
they
are
in
search
of
mana
the
spiritual
the
numinous
but
not
anything
connected
with
formal
religion
what
they
are
after
is
the
beatific
vision
and
zen
buddhism
though
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
understand
how
these
internal
contradictions
are
reconciled
helps
them
in
their
struggle
to
achieve
personal
salvation
through
sexual
release
the
style
of
life
chosen
by
the
beat
generation
the
rhythm
and
ritual
they
have
adopted
as
uniquely
their
own
is
designed
to
enhance
the
value
of
the
sexual
experience
jazz
is
good
not
only
because
it
promotes
wholeness
but
because
of
its
decided
sexual
effect
jazz
is
the
musical
language
of
sex
the
vocabulary
of
the
orgasm
indeed
it
is
maintained
that
the
sexual
element
in
jazz
by
freeing
the
listener
of
his
inhibitions
can
have
therapeutic
value
that
is
why
the
argument
runs
the
squares
are
so
fearful
of
jazz
and
yet
perversely
fascinated
by
it
instead
of
giving
themselves
spontaneously
to
the
orgiastic
release
that
jazz
can
give
them
they
undergo
psychoanalysis
or
flirt
with
mysticism
or
turn
to
prostitutes
for
satisfaction
thus
jazz
is
transmuted
into
something
holy
the
sacred
road
to
integration
of
being
jazz
like
sex
is
a
mystique
it
is
not
a
substitute
for
sex
but
a
dynamic
expression
of
the
creative
impulse
in
unfettered
man
the
mystique
of
sex
combined
with
marijuana
and
jazz
is
intended
to
provide
a
design
for
living
those
who
are
sexually
liberated
can
become
creatively
alive
and
free
their
instincts
put
at
the
service
of
the
imagination
righteous
in
their
denunciation
of
all
that
makes
for
death
the
beat
prophets
bid
all
men
become
cool
cats
let
them
learn
to
swing
freely
to
let
go
to
become
authentically
themselves
and
then
perhaps
civilization
will
be
saved
the
beatnik
seceding
from
a
society
that
is
fatally
afflicted
with
a
deathward
drive
is
concerned
with
his
personal
salvation
in
the
living
present
if
he
is
the
child
of
nothingness
if
he
is
the
predestined
victim
of
an
age
of
atomic
wars
then
he
will
consult
only
his
own
organic
needs
and
go
beyond
good
and
evil
he
will
not
curb
his
instinctual
desires
but
release
the
energy
within
him
that
makes
him
feel
truly
and
fully
alive
even
if
it
is
only
for
this
brief
moment
before
the
apocalypse
of
annihilation
explodes
on
earth
that
is
why
the
members
of
the
beat
generation
proudly
assume
the
title
of
the
holy
barbarians
they
will
destroy
the
shrines
temples
museums
and
churches
of
the
state
that
is
the
implacable
enemy
of
the
life
they
believe
in
apart
from
the
categorical
imperative
they
derive
from
the
metaphysics
of
the
orgasm
the
only
affirmation
they
are
capable
of
making
is
that
art
is
their
only
refuge
their
writing
born
of
their
experiments
in
marijuana
and
untrammeled
sexuality
reflects
the
extremity
of
their
existential
alienation
the
mind
has
betrayed
them
reason
is
the
foe
of
life
they
will
trust
only
their
physical
sensations
the
wisdom
of
the
body
the
holy
promptings
of
the
unconscious
with
lyrical
intensity
they
reveal
what
they
hate
but
their
faith
in
love
inspired
by
the
revolutionary
rhythms
of
jazz
culminates
in
the
climax
of
the
orgasm
their
work
mirrors
the
mentality
of
the
psychopath
rootless
and
irresponsible
their
rebellion
against
authoritarian
society
is
not
far
removed
from
the
violence
of
revolt
characteristic
of
the
juvenile
delinquent
and
the
life
they
lead
is
undisciplined
and
for
the
most
part
unproductive
even
though
they
make
a
fetish
of
devoting
themselves
to
some
creative
pursuit
writing
painting
music
they
are
non
conformists
on
principle
when
they
express
themselves
it
is
incandescent
hatred
that
shines
forth
the
rage
of
repudiation
the
ecstasy
of
negation
it
is
sex
that
obsesses
them
sex
that
is
at
the
basis
of
their
aesthetic
creed
what
they
discuss
with
dialectical
seriousness
is
the
degree
to
which
sex
can
inspire
the
muse
monogamy
is
the
vice
from
which
the
abjectly
fearful
middle
class
continue
to
suffer
whereas
the
beatnik
has
the
courage
to
break
out
of
that
prison
of
respectability
one
girl
describes
her
past
her
succession
of
broken
marriages
the
abortions
she
has
had
and
finally
confesses
that
she
loves
sex
and
sees
no
reason
why
she
must
justify
her
passion
if
it
is
an
honest
feeling
then
why
should
she
not
yield
to
it
most
often
she
says
it
s
the
monogamous
relationship
that
is
dis
honest
there
is
nothing
holy
in
wedlock
this
girl
soon
drops
the
bourgeois
pyschiatrist
who
disapproves
of
her
life
she
finds
married
life
stifling
and
every
prolonged
sex
relationship
unbearably
monotonous
this
confession
serves
to
make
clear
in
part
what
is
behind
this
sexual
revolution
the
craving
for
sensation
for
its
own
sake
the
need
for
change
for
new
experiences
boredom
is
death
in
the
realm
of
physical
sensations
sex
reigns
supreme
hence
the
beatniks
sustain
themselves
on
marijuana
jazz
free
swinging
poetry
exhausting
themselves
in
orgies
of
sex
some
of
them
are
driven
over
the
borderline
of
sanity
and
lose
contact
with
reality
one
beat
poet
composes
a
poem
lines
on
a
tijuana
john
which
contains
a
few
happy
hints
for
survival
the
new
fact
the
initiates
of
this
cult
have
to
learn
is
that
they
must
move
toward
simplicity
the
professed
mission
of
this
disaffiliated
generation
is
to
find
a
new
way
of
life
which
they
can
express
in
poetry
and
fiction
but
what
they
produce
is
unfortunately
disordered
nourished
solely
on
the
hysteria
of
negation
who
are
the
creative
representatives
of
this
movement
nymphomaniacs
junkies
homosexuals
drug
addicts
lesbians
alcoholics
the
weak
the
frustrated
the
irresolute
the
despairing
the
derelicts
and
outcasts
of
society
they
embrace
independent
poverty
usually
with
a
shack
up
partner
who
will
help
support
them
they
are
full
of
contempt
for
the
institution
of
matrimony
their
previous
legalized
marriages
do
not
count
for
they
hold
the
laws
of
the
state
null
and
void
they
feel
they
are
leagued
against
a
hostile
persecutory
world
faced
with
the
concerted
malevolent
opposition
of
squares
and
their
hirelings
the
police
this
is
the
rhetoric
of
righteousness
the
beatniks
use
in
defending
their
way
of
life
their
search
for
wholeness
though
their
actual
existence
fails
to
reach
these
religious
heights
one
beatnik
got
the
woman
he
was
living
with
so
involved
in
drugs
and
self
analysis
and
all
night
sessions
of
sex
that
she
was
beginning
to
crack
up
what
obsessions
had
she
picked
up
during
these
long
nights
of
talk
sex
as
the
creative
principle
of
the
universe
the
secret
of
primitive
religion
the
life
of
myth
everything
in
the
final
analysis
reduced
itself
to
sexual
symbolism
in
his
chapter
on
the
loveways
of
the
beat
generation
lipton
spares
the
reader
none
of
the
sordid
details
no
one
asks
questions
about
the
free
union
of
the
sexes
in
west
venice
so
long
as
the
partners
share
the
negative
attitudes
of
the
group
the
women
who
come
to
west
venice
having
forsaken
radicalism
are
interested
in
living
only
for
the
moment
in
being
constantly
on
the
move
others
who
are
attracted
to
this
mecca
of
the
beat
generation
are
homosexuals
heroin
addicts
and
smalltime
hoodlums
those
who
are
sexual
deviants
are
naturally
drawn
to
join
the
beatniks
since
the
homosexuals
widely
use
marijuana
they
do
not
have
to
be
initiated
part
of
the
ritual
of
sex
is
the
use
of
marijuana
as
lipton
puts
it
the
eros
is
felt
in
the
magic
circle
of
marijuana
with
far
greater
force
as
a
unifying
principle
in
human
relationships
than
at
any
other
time
except
perhaps
in
the
mutual
metaphysical
orgasms
the
magic
circle
is
in
fact
a
symbol
of
and
preparation
for
the
metaphysical
orgasm
under
the
influence
of
marijuana
the
beatnik
comes
alive
within
and
experiences
a
wonderfully
enhanced
sense
of
self
as
if
he
had
discovered
the
open
sesame
to
the
universe
of
being
carried
high
on
this
charge
he
composes
magical
poetry
that
captures
the
organic
rhythms
of
life
in
words
if
he
thus
achieves
a
lyrical
dreamlike
drugged
intensity
he
pays
the
price
for
his
indulgence
by
producing
work
allen
ginsberg
s
howl
is
a
striking
example
of
this
tendency
that
is
disoriented
dionysian
but
without
depth
and
without
apollonian
control
for
drugs
are
in
themselves
no
royal
road
to
creativity
how
is
the
beat
poet
to
achieve
unity
of
form
when
he
is
at
the
same
time
engaged
in
a
systematic
derangement
of
senses
if
love
reflects
the
nature
of
man
as
ortega
y
gasset
believes
if
the
person
in
love
betrays
decisively
what
he
is
by
his
behavior
in
love
then
the
writers
of
the
beat
generation
are
creating
a
new
literary
genre
after
only
eighteen
years
of
non
interference
there
were
already
indications
of
melioration
though
in
a
slight
degree
to
be
sure
there
were
more
indications
by
the
mid
twentieth
century
i
leave
it
to
the
statisticians
to
say
what
they
were
but
i
noticed
several
a
few
years
ago
during
an
automobile
ride
from
memphis
to
hattiesburg
in
town
after
town
my
companion
pointed
out
the
negro
school
and
the
white
school
and
in
every
instance
the
former
made
a
better
appearance
it
was
newer
for
one
thing
it
really
looked
as
if
a
change
of
the
sort
predicted
by
booker
t
washington
had
been
going
on
but
with
the
renewal
of
interference
in
as
with
its
beginning
in
the
improvement
was
impaired
for
over
a
hundred
years
southerners
have
felt
that
the
north
was
picking
on
them
it
s
infuriating
this
feeling
that
one
is
being
picked
on
continually
constantly
by
what
right
of
superior
virtue
southerners
ask
do
the
people
of
the
north
do
this
the
traditional
strategy
of
the
south
has
been
to
expose
the
vices
of
the
north
to
demonstrate
that
the
north
possessed
no
superior
virtue
to
show
the
world
that
as
james
s
christopher
newman
said
to
his
adversaries
however
bad
i
may
be
you
re
not
quite
the
people
to
say
it
in
the
pre
civil
war
years
the
south
argued
that
the
slave
was
not
less
humanely
treated
than
the
factory
worker
of
the
north
at
the
present
time
the
counter
attack
takes
the
line
that
there
s
no
more
of
the
true
spirit
of
integration
in
the
north
than
in
the
south
the
line
is
a
pretty
good
one
people
talk
about
the
law
of
the
land
the
expression
has
become
quite
a
cliche
but
people
ca
n
t
be
made
to
integrate
socialize
the
two
are
inseparable
by
southern
standards
by
law
i
was
having
lunch
not
long
ago
apologies
to
n
v
peale
with
three
distinguished
historians
one
specializing
in
the
european
middle
ages
one
in
american
history
and
one
in
the
far
east
and
i
asked
them
if
they
could
name
instances
where
the
general
mores
had
been
radically
changed
with
deliberate
speed
majestic
instancy
francis
thompson
s
words
for
the
hound
of
heaven
s
pursuit
by
judicial
fiat
they
did
n
t
seem
to
be
able
to
think
of
any
a
virginia
judge
a
while
back
cited
a
roman
jurist
to
the
effect
that
ten
years
might
be
a
reasonable
length
of
time
for
such
a
change
but
i
suspect
that
the
old
roman
was
referring
to
change
made
under
military
occupation
the
sort
of
change
which
tacitus
was
talking
about
when
he
said
they
make
a
desert
and
call
it
peace
solitudinem

moreover
the

of

is
not

it
can

was
the

but
it
was
unpopular
how
many
of
us
oldsters
took
up
drinking
in
prohibition
days
drinking
was
so
gay
so
fashionable
especially
in
the
sophisticated
northeast
and
was
repealed
the
cliche
loses
its
talismanic
virtue
in
the
light
of
a
little
history
the
declaration
of
independence
says
that
governments
derive
their
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
the
phrase
consent
of
the
governed
needs
a
hard
look
how
do
we
define
it
is
the
consent
of
the
governed
a
numerical
majority
calhoun
dealt
with
this
question
in
his
disquisition
on
government
to
guard
against
the
tyranny
of
a
numerical
majority
calhoun
developed
his
theory
of
concurrent
majority
which
he
said
by
giving
to
each
portion
of
the
community
which
may
be
unequally
affected
by
the
action
of
government
a
negative
on
the
others
prevents
all
partial
or
local
legislation
who
will
say
that
our
country
is
even
now
a
homogeneous
community
that
regional
peculiarities
do
not
still
exist
that
the
court
order
does
not
unequally
affect
the
southern
region
who
will
deny
that
in
a
vast
portion
of
the
south
the
federal
action
is
incompatible
with
the
jeffersonian
concept
of
the
consent
of
the

circumstances

a
friend
of
mine
in
new
mexico
said
the
court
order
had
caused
no
particular
trouble
out
there
that
all
had
gone
as
merry
as
a
marriage
bell
he
seemed
a
little
surprised
that
it
should
have
caused
any
particular
trouble
anywhere
i
murmured
something
about
a
possible
difference
between
new
mexico
s
history
and
mississippi
s
one
can
meet
with
aloofness
almost
anywhere
the
thank
heaven
we
re
not

viewpoint
it
does
n
t
affect
us
southern
liberals
there
are
a
good
many
especially
if
they
re
rich
often
exhibit
blithe
insouciance
the
trouble
here
is
that
it
s
almost
too
easy
to
take
the
high
moral
ground
when
it
does
n
t
cost
you
anything
you
ve
already
sent
your
daughter
to
miss
x
s
select
academy
for
girls
and
your
son
to
mr
y
s
select
academy
for
boys
and
you
can
be
as
liberal
as
you
please
with
strict
impunity
if
there
s
no
suitable
academy
in
your
own
neighborhood
there
s
always
new
england
new
england
academies
welcome
fugitives
from
the
provinces
south
as
well
as
west
they
may
even
enroll
a
colored
student
or
two
for
show
though
he
usually
turns
out
to
be
from
thailand
or
any
place
other
than
the
american
south
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
how
much
integration
there
is
in
the
famous
fashionable
colleges
and
prep
schools
of
new
england
a
recent
newspaper
report
said
there
were
five
negroes
in
the
graduating
class
of
nearly
one
thousand
at
yale
that
is
about
one
half
of
one
per
cent
which
looks
pretty
tokenish
to
me
especially
in
an
institution
which
professes
to
be
national
i
must
confess
that
i
prefer
the
liberal
who
is
personally
affected
who
is
willing
to
send
his
own
children
to
a
mixed
school
as
proof
of
his
faith
i
leave
out
of
account
the
question
of
the
best
interests
of
the
children
the
question
of
what
their
best
interests
really
are
i
m
talking
about
the
grand
manner
of
the
liberal
north
and
south
who
is
not
affected
personally
if
these
people
were
denied
a
voice
do
they
have
a
moral
right
to
a
voice
what
voices
would
be
left
who
is
involved
willy
nilly
well
after
everybody
has
followed
the
new
england
pattern
of
segregating
one
s
children
into
private
schools
only
the
poor
folks
are
left
and
it
is
precisely
in
this
poorer
economic
class
that
one
finds
and
has
always
found
the
most
racial
friction
a
dear
respected
friend
of
mine
who
like
myself
grew
up
in
the
south
and
has
spent
many
years
in
new
england
said
to
me
not
long
ago
i
ca
n
t
forgive
new
england
for
rejecting
all
complicity
being
a
teacher
of
american
literature
i
remembered
whittier
s
massachusetts
to
virginia
where
he
said
but
that
one
dark
loathsome
burden
ye
must
stagger
with
alone
and
reap
the
bitter
harvest
which
ye
yourselves
have
sown
there
is
a
legend
hawthorne
records
it
in
his
english
notebooks
and
one
finds
it
again
in
thomas
nelson
page
to
the
effect
that
the
mayflower
on
its
second
voyage
brought
a
cargo
of
negro
slaves
whether
historically
a
fact
or
not
the
legend
has
a
certain
symbolic
value
complicity
is
an
embarrassing
word
it
is
something
which
most
of
us
try
to
get
out
from
under
like
the
cowboy
in
stephen
crane
s
blue
hotel
we
run
around
crying
well
i
did
n
t
do
anything
did
i
robert
penn
warren
puts
it
this
way
in
brother
to
dragons
the
recognition
of
complicity
is
the
beginning
of
innocence
where
innocence
i
think
means
about
the
same
thing
as
redemption
a
man
must
be
able
to
say
father
i
have
sinned
or
there
is
no
hope
for
him
lincoln
understood
this
better
than
most
when
he
said
in
his
second
inaugural
that
god
gives
to
both
north
and
south
this
terrible
war
as
the
woe
due
to
those
by
whom
the
offense
came
he
also
spoke
of
the
wealth
piled
by
the
bondsman
s
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
in
unrequited
toil
lincoln
was
historian
and
economist
enough
to
know
that
a
substantial
portion
of
this
wealth
had
accumulated
in
the
hands
of
the
descendants
of
new
englanders
engaged
in
the
slave
trade
after
how
many
generations
is
such
wealth
mounting
all
the
while
through
the
manipulations
of
high
finance
purified
of
taint
it
is
a
question
which
new
englanders
long
ago
put
out
of
their
minds
but
did
n
t
they
get
off
too
easy
the
slaves
never
shared
in
their
profits
while
they
did
share
in
a
very
real
sense
in
the
profits
of
the
slave
owners
they
were
fed
clothed
doctored
and
so
forth
they
were
the
beneficiaries
of
responsible
paternalistic
care
emerson
platonist
idealist
doctrinaire
sounded
a
high
transcendental
note
in
his
boston
hymn
delivered
in
in
the
boston
music
hall
amidst
thundering
applause
pay
ransom
to
the
owner
and
fill
the
bag
to
the
brim
who
is
the
owner
the
slave
is
owner
and
ever
was
pay
him
it
is
the
abstractionism
the
unrealism
of
the
pure
idealist
it
ignores
the
sordid
financial
aspects
quite
conveniently
too
for
his
audience
who
could
indulge
in
moral
indignation
without
visible
or
even
conscious
discomfort
their
money
from
the
transaction
having
been
put
away
long
ago
in
a
good
antiseptic
brokerage
like
pilate
they
had
washed
their
hands
but
can
one
really
can
god
be
mocked
ever
in
the
long
run
new
englanders
were
a
bit
sensitive
on
the
subject
of
their
complicity
in
negro
slavery
at
the
time
of
the
drafting
of
the
declaration
of
independence
as
jefferson
explained
in
his
autobiography
the
clause
reprobating
the
enslaving
the
inhabitants
of
africa
was
struck
out
in
complaisance
to
south
carolina
and
georgia
who
had
never
attempted
to
restrain
the
importation
of
slaves
and
who
on
the
contrary
still
wished
to
continue
it
our
northern
brethren
also
i
believe
felt
a
little
tender
under
those
censures
for
though
their
people
had
very
few
slaves
themselves
yet
they
had
been
pretty
considerable
carriers
of
them
to
others
but
that
was
a
long
time
ago
the
new
england
conscience
became
desensitized
george

northampton
lovely
symbolic
name
agitated
continuously
the
southern
question
it
was
nice
to
be
able
to
isolate
it
new
england
as
everyone
knows
has
long
been
schoolmaster
to
the
nation
there
one
finds
concentrated
in
a
comparatively
small
area
the
chief
universities
colleges
and
preparatory
schools
of
the
united
states
why
should
this
be
so
it
is
true
that
new
england
more
than
any
other
section
was
dedicated
to
education
from
the
start
but
i
think
that
something
more
than
this
is
involved
how
did
it
happen
for
example
that
the
state
university
that
great
symbol
of
american
democracy
failed
to
flourish
in
new
england
as
it
did
in
other
parts
of
the
country
is
n
t
it
a
bit
odd
that
the
three
states
of
southern
new
england
massachusetts
connecticut
and
rhode
island
have
had
state
institutions
of
university
status
only
in
the
very
recent
past
these
institutions
having
previously
been
a
m
colleges
was
it
supposed
perchance
that
a
m
vocational
training
that
is
was
quite
sufficient
for
the
immigrant
class
which
flooded
that
part
of
the
new
england
world
in
the
post
civil
war
period
the
immigrants
having
been
brought
in
from
southern
europe
to
work
in
the
mills
to
make
up
for
the
labor
shortage
caused
by
migration
to
the
west
is
it
not
ironical
that
roger
williams
s
state
rhode
island
should
have
been
the
very
last
of
the
forty
eight
to
establish
a
state
university
the
state
universities
of
maine
new
hampshire
and
vermont
are
older
and
more
respectable
they
had
less
immigration
to
contend
with
a
yale
historian
writing
a
few
years
ago
in
the
yale
review
said
we
in
new
england
have
long
since
segregated
our
children
he
was
referring
not
only
to
the
general
college
situation
but
more
especially
to
the
preparatory
schools
and
what
a
galaxy
of
those
adorns
that
fair
land
i
do
n
t
propose
to
go
into
their
history
but
i
have
one
or
two
surmises
one
is
that
they
were
established
or
gained
eminence
under
pressure
provided
by
these
same
immigrants
from
whom
the
old
families
wished
to
segregate
their
children
in
the
early
days
of
a
homogeneous
population
the
public
school
was
quite
satisfactory
among
the
recipients
of
the
nobel
prize
for
literature
more
than
half
are
practically
unknown
to
readers
of
english
of
these
there
are
surely
few
that
would
be
more
rewarding
discoveries
than
verner
von
heidenstam
the
swedish
poet
and
novelist
who
received
the
award
in
and
whose
centennial
was
celebrated
two
years
ago
equally
a
master
of
prose
and
verse
he
recreates
the
glory
of
sweden
in
the
past
and
continues
it
into
the
present
in
the
following
sketch
we
shall
present
a
brief
outline
of
his
life
and
let
him
as
much
as
possible
speak
for
himself
heidenstam
was
born
in
of
a
prosperous
family
on
his
father
s
side
he
was
of
german
descent
on
his
mother
s
he
came
of
the
old
swedish
nobility
the
family
estate
was
situated
near
vadstena
on
lake
v
ttern
in
south
central
sweden
it
is
a
lonely
rather
desolate
region
but
full
of
legendary
and
historic
associations
as
a
boy
in
a
local
school
he
was
shy
and
solitary
absorbed
in
his
fondness
for
nature
and
his
visions
of
sweden
s
ancient
glory
he
liked
to
fancy
himself
as
a
chieftain
and
to
dress
for
the
part
being
somewhat
delicate
in
health
at
the
age
of
sixteen
he
was
sent
to
southern
europe
for
which
he
at
once
developed
a
passion
so
that
he
spent
nearly
all
of
the
following
ten
years
abroad
at
first
in
italy
then
in
greece
egypt
asia
minor
and
palestine
in
one
of
his
summers
at
home
he
married
to
the
great
disapproval
of
his
father
who
objected
because
of
his
extreme
youth
deciding
to
become
a
painter
he
entered
the
studio
of
gerome
in
paris
where
he
enjoyed
the
life
of
the
artists
but
soon
found
that
whatever
talent
he
might
have
did
not
lie
in
that
direction
he
gives
us
an
account
of
this
in
his
lively
and
humorous
poem
the
happy
artists
i
scanned
the
world
through
printed
symbol
swart
and
through
the
beggar
s
rags
i
strove
to
see
the
inner
man
i
looked
unceasingly
with
my
cold
mind
and
with
my
burning
heart
in
this
final
line
we
have
the
key
to
his
nature
few
writers
have
better
understood
their
deepest
selves
heidenstam
could
never
be
satisfied
by
surface
it
may
however
be
noted
that
his
gift
for
color
and
imagery
must
have
been
greatly
stimulated
by
his
stay
in
paris
the
first
result
of
heidenstam
s
long
sojourn
abroad
was
a
volume
of
poems
pilgrimage
and
wander
years
vallfart
och
vandringsar
published
in
it
was
a
brilliant
debut
so
much
so
indeed
that
it
aroused
a
new
vitality
in
the
younger
poets
as
did
byron
s
childe
harold
professor
fredrik
b
k
sweden
s
foremost
critic
of
the
period
acclaims
it
as
follows
in
this
we
have
the
verse
of
a
painter
strongly
colorful
plastic
racy
vivid
in
a
bold
sometimes
careless
form
there
is
nothing
academic
all
is
seen
and
felt
and
experienced
the
observation
is
sharp
and
the
imagination
lively
the
young
poet
painter
reproduces
the
french
life
of
the
streets
he
tells
stories
of
the
thousand
and
one
nights
and
conjures
up
before
us
the
bazaars
of
damascus
in
the
care
free
indolence
of
the
east
he
sees
the
last
reflection
of
the
old
happy
existence
and
for
that
reason
he
loves
it
and
yet
amid
all
the
gay
hedonism
in
pilgrimage
and
wander
years
is
a
cycle
of
short
poems
thoughts
in
loneliness
filled
with
brooding
melancholy
and
sombre
longing
of
the
longer
pieces
of
the
volume
none
is
so
memorable
as
nameless
and
immortal
which
at
once
took
rank
among
the
finest
poems
ever
written
in
the
swedish
language
it
celebrates
the
unknown
architect
who
designed
the
temple
of
neptune
at
paestum
next
to
the
parthenon
the
noblest
example
of
grecian
classic
style
now
in
existence
on
the
eve
of
his
return
to
their
native
naxos
he
speaks
with
his
wife
of
the
masterpiece
which
rises
before
them
in
its
completed
perfection
the
supreme
object
of
their
lives
is
now
fulfilled
says
the
wife
her
husband
has
achieved
immortality
not
so
he
answers
it
is
not
the
architect
but
the
temple
that
is
immortal
the
man
s
true
reputation
is
his
work
the
short
poems
grouped
at
the
end
of
the
volume
as
thoughts
in
loneliness
is
as
professor
b
k
indicated
in
sharp
contrast
with
the
others
it
consists
of
fragmentary
personal
revelations
such
as
the
spark
there
is
a
spark
dwells
deep
within
my
soul
to
get
it
out
into
the
daylight
s
glow
is
my
life
s
aim
both
first
and
last
the
whole
it
slips
away
it
burns
and
tortures
me
that
little
spark
is
all
the
wealth
i
know
that
little
spark
is
my
life
s
misery
a
dominant
motive
is
the
poet
s
longing
for
his
homeland
and
its
boyhood
associations
not
men
folk
but
the
fields
where
i
would
stray
the
stones
where
as
a
child
i
used
to
play
he
is
utterly
disappointed
in
himself
and
in
the
desultory
life
he
has
been
leading
what
he
really
wants
is
to
find
a
sacred
cause
to
which
he
can
honestly
devote
himself
this
restless
individualism
found
its
answer
when
he
returned
to
live
nearly
all
the
rest
of
his
life
in
sweden
his
cause
was
to
commemorate
the
glory
of
her
past
and
to
incite
her
people
to
perpetuate
it
in
the
present
he
did
not
however
find
himself
at
once
his
next
major
work
completed
in
was
a
long
fantastic
epic
in
prose
entitled
hans
alienus
which
professor
b
k
describes
as
a
monument
on
the
grave
of
his
carefree
and
indolent
youth
the
hero
who
is
himself
is
represented
as
a
pilgrim
in
the
storied
lands
of
the
east
a
sort
of
faustus
type
who
to
quote
from
professor
b
k
again
even
in
the
pleasure
gardens
of
sardanapalus
can
not
cease
from
his
painful
search
after
the
meaning
of
life
he
is
driven
back
by
his
yearning
to
the
wintry
homeland
of
his
fathers
in
the
forest
of
tiveden
from
this
time
on
heidenstam
proceeded
to
find
his
deeper
self
by
the
death
of
his
father
in
he
had
come
into
possession
of
the
family
estate
and
had
re
assumed
its
traditions
he
did
not
however
settle
back
into
acquiescence
with
things
as
they
were
like
his
friend
and
contemporary
august
strindberg
he
had
little
patience
with
collective
mediocrity
he
saw
sweden
as
a
country
of
smug
and
narrow
provincialism
indifferent
to
the
heroic
spirit
of
its
former
glory
strindberg
s
remedy
for
this
condition
was
to
tear
down
the
old
structures
and
build
anew
from
the
ground
up
heidenstam
s
conception
on
the
contrary
was
to
revive
the
present
by
the
memories
of
the
past
whether
in
prose
or
poetry
all
of
heidenstam
s
later
work
was
concerned
with
sweden
with
the
first
of
a
group
of
historical
novels
the
charles
men
karolinerna
published
in
he
achieved
the
masterpiece
of
his
career
in
scope
and
power
it
can
only
be
compared
to
tolstoy
s
war
and
peace
about
one
third
as
long
it
is
less
intimate
and
detailed
but
better
coordinated
more
concise
and
more
dramatic
though
it
centers
around
the
brilliant
and
enigmatic
figure
of
charles
xii
the
true
hero
is
not
finally
the
king
himself
hence
the
title
of
the
book
referring
to
the
soldiers
and
subjects
of
the
king
on
the
fatal
battlefield
of
poltava
to
quote
from
the
novel
the
wreath
he
twined
for
himself
slipped
down
upon
his
people
the
charles
men
consists
not
of
a
connected
narrative
but
of
a
group
of
short
stories
each
depicting
a
special
phase
of
the
general
subject
somewhat
uneven
in
interest
for
an
average
reader
eight
or
ten
of
these
are
among
the
finest
of
their
kind
in
literature
they
comprise
a
great
variety
of
scene
and
interest
grim
episodes
of
war
idyllic
interludes
superb
canvases
of
world
shaking
events
and
delightfully
humorous
sketches
of
odd
characters
the
general
effect
is
tragic
almost
nothing
is
said
of
charles
spectacular
victories
the
central
theme
being
the
heroic
loyalty
of
the
swedish
people
to
their
idolized
king
in
misfortune
and
defeat
to
carry
out
this
exalted
conception
the
author
has
combined
the
vivid
realism
and
imaginative
power
we
have
noticed
in
his
early
poetry
and
carried
them
out
on
a
grand
scale
his
peculiar
gift
as
had
been
suggested
before
is
his
intensity
george
meredith
has
said
that
fervor
is
the
core
of
style
of
few
authors
is
this
more
true
than
of
heidenstam
the
charles
men
has
a
tremendous
range
of
characters
of
common
folk
even
more
than
of
major
figures
the
career
of
charles
xii
is
obviously
very
similar
to
that
of
napoleon
his
ideal
was
alexander
of
macedon
as
napoleon
s
was
julius
caesar
his
purpose
however
was
not
to
establish
an
empire
but
to
assert
the
principle
of
divine
justice
each
aspired
to
be
a
god
in
human
form
but
with
each
it
was
a
different
kind
of
god
each
failed
catastrophically
in
an
invasion
of
russia
and
each
brought
ruin
on
the
country
that
worshipped
him
each
is
still
glorified
as
a
national
hero
the
first
half
of
the
charles
men
ending
on
the
climax
of
the
battle
of
poltava
in
is
more
dramatically
coherent
than
the
second
after
the
collapse
of
that
desperate
and
ill
fated
campaign
the
character
of
the
king
degenerated
for
a
time
into
a
futility
that
was
not
merely
pitiable
but
often
ridiculous
like
napoleon
he
was
the
worst
of
losers
there
are
however
some
wonderful
chapters
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
part
concerning
the
reactions
of
the
swedes
in
adversity
then
more
than
ever
before
did
they
show
their
fortitude
and
patient
cheerfulness
this
comes
out
in
when
the
bells
ring
which
describes
the
rallying
of
the
peasants
in
southern
sweden
to
repel
an
invasion
by
the
danes
in
the
king
s
ride
charles
breaks
out
of
a
long
period
of
petulance
and
inertia
regains
his
old
self
escapes
from
turkey
and
finally
reaches
his
own
land
after
an
absence
of
eighteen
years
he
finds
it
in
utter
misery
and
desolation
all
his
people
ask
for
is
no
more
war
but
he
plunges
into
yet
another
this
time
with
norway
and
is
killed
in
an
assault
on
the
fortress
of
fredrikshall
being
only
thirty
six
years
of
age
when
he
died
he
had
become
king
at
fifteen
then
suddenly
there
was
a
tremendous
revulsion
of
popular
feeling
from
being
a
hated
tyrant
and
madman
he
was
now
the
symbol
of
all
that
was
noblest
and
best
in
the
history
of
sweden
this
is
brought
out
in
the
next
to
last
chapter
of
the
book
a
hero
s
funeral
written
in
the
form
of
an
impassioned
prose
poem
slowly
the
procession
of
warriors
and
statesmen
passes
through
the
snow
beside
the
black
water
and
into
the
brilliantly
lighted
cathedral
the
shrine
of
so
many
precious
memories
the
guns
are
fired
the
hymns
are
sung
and
the
body
of
charles
is
carried
down
to
the
vault
and
laid
beside
the
tombs
of
his
ancestors
as
he
had
longed
to
be
he
became
the
echo
of
a
saga
heidenstam
wrote
four
other
works
of
fiction
about
earlier
figures
revered
in
swedish
memory
excellent
in
their
way
they
lack
the
wide
appeal
of
the
charles
men
and
need
not
detain
us
here
it
is
different
with
his
volume
the
swedes
and
their
chieftains
svenskarna
och
deras
h
vdingar
a
history
intended
for
the
general
reader
and
particularly
suited
for
high
school
students
admirably
written
it
is
a
perfect
introduction
to
swedish
history
for
readers
of
other
countries
some
of
the
earlier
episodes
have
touches
of
the
supernatural
as
suited
to
the
legendary
background
these
are
suggestive
of
selma
lagerl
f
especially
touching
is
the
chapter
the
little
sister
about
a
king
s
daughter
who
became
a
nun
in
the
convent
of
st
birgitta
the
record
teems
with
romance
and
adventure
gustaf
vasa
is
a
superb
example
and
charles
x
the
conqueror
of
denmark
hardly
less
so
of
gustavus
adolphus
and
charles
xii
it
is
unnecessary
to
speak
does
our
society
have
a
runaway
uncontrollable
growth
of
technology
which
may
end
our
civilization
or
a
normal
healthy
growth
here
there
may
be
an
analogy
with
cancer
we
can
detect
cancers
by
their
rapidly
accelerating
growth
determinable
only
when
related
to
the
more
normal
rate
of
healthy
growth
should
the
accelerating
growth
of
technology
then
warn
us
noting
such
evidence
is
the
first
step
and
almost
the
only
cure
is
early
detection
and
removal
one
way
to
determine
whether
we
have
so
dangerous
a
technology
would
be
to
check
the
strength
of
our
society
s
organs
to
see
if
their
functioning
is
as
healthy
as
before
so
an
objective
look
at
our
present
procedures
may
move
us
to
consider
seriously
this
possibly
analogous
situation
in
any
event
whether
society
may
have
cancer
or
merely
a
virus
infection
the
disease
we
shall
find
is
political
economical
social
and
even
medical
have
not
our
physical
abilities
already
deteriorated
because
of
the
more
sedentary
lives
we
are
now
living
hence
the
prime
issue
as
i
see
it
is
whether
a
democratic
or
free
society
can
master
technology
for
the
benefit
of
mankind
or
whether
technology
will
rule
and
develop
its
own
society
compatible
with
its
own
needs
as
a
force
of
nature
we
are
already
committed
to
establishing
man
s
supremacy
over
nature
and
everywhere
on
earth
not
merely
in
the
limited
social
political
economical
context
we
are
fond
of
today
otherwise
we
go
on
endlessly
trying
to
draw
the
line
color
and
other
as
to
which
kind
of
man
we
wish
to
see
dominate
we
have
proved
so
able
to
solve
technological
problems
that
to
contend
we
can
not
realize
a
universal
goal
in
the
immediate
future
is
to
be
extremely
shortsighted
if
nothing
else
we
must
believe
we
have
the
ability
to
affect
our
own
destinies
otherwise
why
try
anything
so
in
these
pages
the
term
technology
is
used
to
include
any
and
all
means
which
could
amplify
project
or
augment
man
s
control
over
himself
and
over
other
men
naturally
this
includes
all
communication
forms
e
g
languages
or
any
social
political
economic
or
religious
structures
employed
for
such
control
properly
mindful
of
all
the
cultures
in
existence
today
throughout
the
world
we
must
employ
these
resources
without
war
or
violent
revolution
if
we
were
creating
a
wholly
new
society
we
could
insist
that
our
social
political
economic
and
philosophic
institutions
foster
rather
than
hamper
man
s
best
growth
but
we
can
not
start
off
with
a
clean
slate
so
we
must
first
analyze
our
present
institutions
with
respect
to
the
effect
of
each
on
man
s
major
needs
asked
which
institution
most
needs
correction
i
would
say
the
corporation
as
it
exists
in
america
today
at
first
glance
this
appears
strange
of
all
people
was
not
america
founded
by
rugged
individualists
who
established
a
new
way
of
life
still
inspiring
undeveloped
societies
abroad
but
hear
harrison
e
salisbury
former
moscow
correspondent
of
the
new
york
times
and
author
of
to
moscow
and
beyond
in
a
book
review
of
the
soviet
cultural
offensive
he
says
long
before
the
state
department
organized
its
bureaucracy
into
an
east
west
contacts
staff
in
order
to
wage
a
cultural
counter
offensive
within
soviet
borders
the
sharp
cutting
edge
of
american
culture
had
carved
its
mark
across
the
russian
steppes
as
when
the
enterprising
promoters
of
porgy
and
bess
overrode
the
state
department
to
carry
the
contemporary
cultural
warfare
behind
the
enemy
lines
they
were
not
diplomats
or
jazz
musicians
or
even
organizers
of
reading
rooms
and
photo
montage
displays
but
rugged
capitalist
entrepreneurs
like
henry
ford
hugh
cooper
thomas
campbell
the
international
harvester
co
and
david
w
griffith
their
kind
created
an
american
culture
superior
to
any
in
the
world
an
industrial
and
technological
culture
which
penetrated
russia
as
it
did
almost
every
corner
of
the
earth
without
a
nickel
from
the
federal
treasury
or
a
single
governmental
specialist
to
contrive
directives
or
program
a
series
of
consultations
of
interested
agencies
this
favorable
image
of
america
in
the
minds
of
russian
men
and
women
is
still
there
despite
years
of
energetic
anti
american
propaganda
corporations
now
outmoded
perhaps
the
public
s
present
attitude
toward
business
stems
from
the
fact
that
the
rugged
capitalist
entrepreneur
no
more
exists
in
america
in
his
stead
is
a
milquetoast
version
known
as
the
corporation
but
even
if
we
can
not
see
the
repulsive
characteristics
in
this
new
image
of
america
foreigners
can
and
our
loss
of
prestige
abroad
is
the
direct
result
no
amount
of
ballyhoo
will
cover
up
the
sordid
facts
if
we
want
respect
from
ourselves
or
others
we
will
have
to
earn
it
first
let
us
realize
that
whatever
good
this
set
up
achieved
in
earlier
times
now
the
corporation
per
se
can
not
take
economic
leadership
businesses
must
develop
as
a
result
of
the
ideas
energies
and
ambitions
of
an
individual
having
purpose
and
comprehensive
ability
within
one
mind
when
we
forced
individuals
to
assume
the
corporate
structure
by
means
of
taxes
and
other
legal
statutes
we
adopted
what
i
would
term
pseudo
capitalism
and
so
took
a
major
step
toward
socialism
the
biggest
loss
of
course
was
the
individual
s
lessened
desire
and
ability
to
give
his
services
to
the
growth
of
his
company
and
our
economy
socialism
i
grant
has
a
definite
place
in
our
society
but
let
us
not
complain
of
the
evils
of
capitalism
by
referring
to
a
form
that
is
not
truly
capitalistic
some
forms
of
capitalism
do
indeed
work
superb
organizations
a
credit
to
any
society
but
the
pseudo
capitalism
which
dictates
our
whole
economy
as
well
as
our
politics
and
social
life
will
not
stand
close
scrutiny
its
pretense
to
operate
in
the
public
interest
is
little
more
than
a
sham
it
serves
only
its
own
stockholders
and
poorly
at
that
as
a
creative
enterprise
its
abilities
are
primarily
in
swallowing
creative
enterprises
developed
outside
its
own
organization
an
ability
made
possible
by
us
and
almost
mandatory
as
to
benefits
to
employees
it
is
notorious
for
its
callous
disregard
except
where
it
depends
on
them
for
services
the
corporation
in
america
is
in
reality
our
form
of
socialism
vying
in
a
sense
with
the
other
socialistic
form
that
has
emerged
within
governmental
bureaucracy
but
while
the
corporation
has
all
the
disadvantages
of
the
socialist
form
of
organization
so
cumbersome
it
can
not
constructively
do
much
of
anything
not
compatible
with
its
need
to
perpetuate
itself
and
maintain
its
status
quo
unluckily
it
does
not
have
the
desirable
aspect
of
socialism
the
motivation
to
operate
for
the
benefit
of
society
as
a
whole
so
we
are
faced
with
a
vast
network
of
amorphous
entities
perpetuating
themselves

of

controlling
society
and
forcing
upon
it
a
regime
representing
only
the

s
needs
for
survival
the
corporation
has
a
limited
specific
place
in
our
society
ideally
speaking
it
should
be
allowed
to
operate
only
where
the
public
has
a
great
stake
in
the
continuity
of
supply
or
services
and
where
the
actions
of
a
single
proprietor
are
secondary
to
the
needs
of
society
examples
are
in
public
utilities
making
military
aircraft
and
accessories
or
where
the
investment
and
risk
for
a
proprietorship
would
be
too
great
for
a
much
needed
project
impossible
to
achieve
by
any
means
other
than
the
corporate
form
e
g
constructing
major
airports
or
dams
thus
if
corporations
are
not
to
run
away
with
us
they
must
become
quasi
governmental
institutions
subject
to
public
control
and
needs
in
all
other
areas
private
initiative
of
the
proprietorship
type
should
be
urged
to
produce
the
desired
goods
and
services
proprietorship
avoiding
runaway
technology
can
be
done
only
by
assuring
a
humane
society
and
for
this
human
beings
must
be
firmly
in
control
of
the
economics
on
which
our
society
rests
such
genuine
human
leadership
the
proprietorship
can
offer
corporations
can
not
it
can
project
long
range
goals
for
itself
corporations
react
violently
to
short
range
stimuli
e
g
quarterly
and
annual

reports
proprietorships
can
establish
a
unity
and
integrity
of
control
corporations
being
more
amorphous
can
not
proprietorships
can
establish
a
meaningful
identity
representing
a
human
personality
and
thus
establish
sincere
relationships
with
customers
and
community
corporations
are
apt
by
nature
to
be
impersonal
inhumane
shortsighted
and
almost
exclusively
profit
motivated
a
picture
they
could
scarcely
afford
to
present
to
the
public
the
proprietor
is
able
to
create
a
leadership
impossible
in
the
corporate
structure
with
its
board
of
directors
and
stockholders
leadership
is
lacking
in
our
society
because
it
has
no
legitimate
place
to
develop
men
continuously
at
the
head
of
growing
enterprises
can
acquire
experiences
of
the
most
varied
complicated
and
trying
type
so
that
at
maturation
they
have
developed
the
competence
and
willingness
to
accept
the
personal
responsibility
so
sorely
needed
now
hence
government
must
establish
greater
controls
upon
corporations
so
that
their
activities
promote
what
is
deemed
essential
to
the
national
interest
proprietorships
should
get
the
tax
advantages
now
accruing
to
corporations
e
g
the
chance
to
accumulate
capital
so
vital
for
growth
corporations
should
pay
added
taxes
to
be
used
for
educational
purposes
not
necessarily
of
the
formal
type
the
right
to
leave
legacies
should
be
substantially
reduced
and
ultimately
eliminated
to
perpetuate
wealth
control
led
by
small
groups
of
individuals
who
played
no
role
in
its
creation
prevents
those
with
real
initiative
from
coming
to
the
fore
and
is
basically
anti
democratic
when
the
proprietor
dies
the
establishment
should
become
a
corporation
until
it
is
either
acquired
by
another
proprietor
or
the
government
decides
to
drop
it
strikes
should
be
declared
illegal
against
corporations
because
disagreements
would
have
to
be
settled
by
government
representatives
acting
as
controllers
of
the
corporation
whose
responsibility
to
the
state
would
now
be
defined
against
proprietorship
because
employees
and
proprietors
must
be
completely
interdependent
as
they
are
each
a
part
of
the
whole
strikes
threatening
the
security
of
the
proprietorship
if
internally
motivated
prevent
a
healthy
relationship
certainly
external
forces
should
not
be
applied
arbitrarily
out
of
mere
power
available
to
do
so
if
we
can
not
stop
warfare
in
our
own
economic
system
how
can
we
expect
to
abolish
it
internationally
one
kind
of
proprietorship
these
proposals
would
go
far
toward
creating
the
economic
atmosphere
favoring
growth
of
the
individual
who
in
turn
would
help
us
to
cope
with
runaway
technology
individual
human
strength
is
needed
to
pit
against
an
inhuman
condition
the
battle
is
not
easy
we
are
tempted
to
blame
others
for
our
problems
rather
than
look
them
straight
in
the
face
and
realize
they
are
of
our
own
making
and
possible
of
solution
only
by
ourselves
with
the
help
of
desperately
needed
enlightened
competent
leaders

judgment
based
on
experiences
of

in

and
in

outside

have
been

do
many
things
for
my

which
normal

of
comparable

would
have
been
unable
to
do
also
i
am
convinced
that
if
my

were
a
sole
proprietorship
instead
of
a

i
would
have
been
even
abler
to
solve
long
range
problems
for
myself
and
my

any
abilities
i
may

in

from

and

of

coupled
with

this
combined

on
a

of
very
average
i
assure
you

would
bet
heavily
against
perhaps
a
list
of
some
of
the
practices
of
my

help
here
the

grew
out
of
efforts
by
two
completely
inexperienced
men
in
their
late
twenties
neither
having
a
formal

with

and
no

is
in

our
pin
curl
clips
and
self
locking
nuts
achieved
dominance
in
just
a
few
years
time
despite
substantial
well
established
competition
introduction
it
has
recently
become
practical
to
use
the
radio
emission
of
the
moon
and
planets
as
a
new
source
of
information
about
these
bodies
and
their
atmospheres
the
results
of
present
observations
of
the
thermal
radio
emission
of
the
moon
are
consistent
with
the
very
low
thermal
conductivity
of
the
surface
layer
which
was
derived
from
the
variation
in
the
infrared
emission
during
eclipses
e
g
garstung
when
sufficiently
accurate
and
complete
measurements
are
available
it
will
be
possible
to
set
limits
on
the
thermal
and
electrical
characteristics
of
the
surface
and
subsurface
materials
of
the
moon
observations
of
the
radio
emission
of
a
planet
which
has
an
extensive
atmosphere
will
probe
the
atmosphere
to
a
greater
extent
than
those
using
shorter
wave
lengths
and
should
in
some
cases
give
otherwise
unobtainable
information
about
the
characteristics
of
the
solid
surface
radio
observations
of
venus
and
jupiter
have
already
supplied
unexpected
experimental
data
on
the
physical
conditions
of
these
planets
the
observed
intensity
of
the
radio
emission
of
venus
is
much
higher
than
the
expected
thermal
intensity
although
the
spectrum
indicated
by
measurements
at
wave
lengths
near
cm
and
cm
is
like
that
of
a
black
body
at
about
k
this
result
suggests
a
very
high
temperature
at
the
solid
surface
of
the
planet
although
there
is
the
possibility
that
the
observed
radiation
may
be
a
combination
of
both
thermal
and
non
thermal
components
and
that
the
observed
spectrum
is
that
of
a
black
body
merely
by
coincidence
for
the
case
of
jupiter
the
radio
emission
spectrum
is
definitely
not
like
the
spectrum
of
a
black
body
radiator
and
it
seems
very
likely
that
the
radiation
reaching
the
earth
is
a
combination
of
thermal
radiation
from
the
atmosphere
and
non
thermal
components
of
the
remaining
planets
only
mars
and
saturn
have
been
observed
as
radio
sources
and
not
very
much
information
is
available
mars
has
been
observed
twice
at
about
cm
wave
length
and
the
intensity
of
the
observed
radiation
is
in
reasonable
agreement
with
the
thermal
radiation
which
might
be
predicted
on
the
basis
of
the
known
temperature
of
mars
the
low
intensity
of
the
radiation
from
saturn
has
limited
observations
but
again
the
measured
radiation
seems
to
be
consistent
with
a
thermal
origin
no
attempts
to
measure
the
radio
emission
of
the
remaining
planets
have
been
reported
and
because
of
their
distances
small
diameters
or
low
temperatures
the
thermal
radiation
at
radio
wave
lengths
reaching
the
earth
from
these
sources
is
expected
to
be
of
very
low
intensity
in
spite
of
this
the
very
large
radio
reflectors
and
improved
amplifying
techniques
which
are
now
becoming
available
should
make
it
possible
to
observe
the
radio
emission
of
most
of
the
planets
in
a
few
years
the
study
of
the
radio
emission
of
the
moon
and
planets
began
with
the
detection
of
the
thermal
radiation
of
the
moon
at
cm
wave
length
by
dicke
and
beringer
this
was
followed
by
a
comprehensive
series
of
observations
of
the
cm
emission
of
the
moon
over
three
lunar
cycles
by
piddington
and
minnett
they
deduced
from
their
measurements
that
the
radio
emission
from
the
whole
disk
of
the
moon
varied
during
a
lunation
in
a
roughly
sinusoidal
fashion
that
the
amplitude
of
the
variation
was
considerably
less
than
the
amplitude
of
the
variation
in
the
infrared
emission
as
measured
by
pettit
and
nicholson
and
pettit
and
that
the
maximum
of
the
radio
emission
came
about
days
after
full
moon
which
is
again
in
contrast
to
the
infrared
emission
which
reaches
its
maximum
at
full
moon
piddington
and
minnett
explained
their
observations
by
pointing
out
that
rocklike
materials
which
are
likely
to
make
up
the
surface
of
the
moon
would
be
partially
transparent
to
radio
waves
although
opaque
to
infrared
radiation
the
infrared
emission
could
then
be
assumed
to
originate
at
the
surface
of
the
moon
while
the
radio
emission
originates
at
some
depth
beneath
the
surface
where
the
temperature
variation
due
to
solar
radiation
is
reduced
in
amplitude
and
shifted
in
phase
since
the
absorption
of
radio
waves
in
rocklike
material
varies
with
wave
length
it
should
be
possible
to
sample
the
temperature
variation
at
different
depths
beneath
the
surface
and
possibly
detect
changes
in
the
structure
or
composition
of
the
lunar
surface
material
the
radio
emission
of
a
planet
was
first
detected
in
when
burke
and
franklin
identified
the
origin
of
interference
like
radio
noise
on
their
records
at
about
meters
wave
length
as
emission
from
jupiter
this
sporadic
type
of
planetary
radiation
is
discussed
by
burke
chap
and
gallet
chap
steady
radiation
which
was
presumably
of
thermal
origin
was
observed
from
venus
at
and
cm
and
from
mars
and
jupiter
at
cm
in
mayer
mccullough
and
sloanaker
a
b
c
and
from
saturn
at
cm
in
drake
and
ewen
in
the
relatively
short
time
since
these
early
observations
venus
has
been
observed
at
additional
wave
lengths
in
the
range
from
to
cm
and
jupiter
has
been
observed
over
the
wave
length
range
from
to
cm
the
observable
characteristics
of
planetary
radio
radiation
are
the
intensity
the
polarization
and
the
direction
of
arrival
of
the
waves
the
maximum
angular
diameter
of
any
planetary
disk
as
observed
from
the
earth
is
about
minute
of
arc
this
is
much
smaller
than
the
highest
resolution
of
even
the
very
large
reflectors
now
under
construction
and
consequently
the
radio
emission
of
different
regions
of
the
disk
can
not
be
resolved
it
should
be
possible
however
to
put
useful
limits
on
the
diameters
of
the
radio
sources
by
observing
with
large
reflectors
or
with
interferometers
measurements
of
polarization
are
presently
limited
by
apparatus
sensitivity
and
will
remain
difficult
because
of
the
low
intensity
of
the
planetary
radiation
at
the
earth
there
have
been
few
measurements
specifically
for
the
determination
of
the
polarization
of
planetary
radiation
the
measurements
made
with
the
nrl
foot
reflector
which
is
altitude
azimuth
mounted
would
have
shown
a
systematic
change
with
local
hour
angle
in
the
measured
intensities
of
venus
and
jupiter
if
a
substantial
part
of
the
radiation
had
been
linearly
polarized
recent
interferometer
measurements
radhakrishnan
and
roberts
have
shown
the
mc
emission
of
jupiter
to
be
partially
polarized
and
to
originate
in
a
region
of
larger
diameter
than
the
visible
disk
other
than
this
very
significant
result
most
of
the
information
now
available
about
the
radio
emission
of
the
planets
is
restricted
to
the
intensity
of
the
radiation
the
concept
of
apparent
black
body
temperature
is
used
to
describe
the
radiation
received
from
the
moon
and
the
planets
the
received
radiation
is
compared
with
the
radiation
from
a
hypothetical
black
body
which
subtends
the
same
solid
angle
as
the
visible
disk
of
the
planet
the
apparent
black
body
disk
temperature
is
the
temperature
which
must
be
assumed
for
the
black
body
in
order
that
the
intensity
of
its
radiation
should
equal
that
of
the
observed
radiation
the
use
of
this
concept
does
not
specify
the
origin
of
the
radiation
and
only
if
the
planet
really
radiates
as
a
black
body
will
the
apparent
black
body
temperature
correspond
to
the
physical
temperature
of
the
emitting
material
the
radio
radiation
of
the
sun
which
is
reflected
from
the
moon
and
planets
should
be
negligible
compared
with
their
thermal
emission
at
centimeter
wave
lengths
except
possibly
at
times
of
exceptional
outbursts
of
solar
radio
noise
the
quiescent
level
of
centimeter
wave
length
solar
radiation
would
increase
the
average
disk
brightness
temperature
by
less
than
k
at
meter
wave
lengths
an
increase
of
the
order
of
k
in
the
average
disk
temperatures
of
the
nearer
planets
would
be
expected
therefore
neglecting
the
extreme
outbursts
reflected
solar
radiation
is
not
expected
to
cause
sizable
errors
in
the
measurements
of
planetary
radiation
in
the
centimeter
and
decimeter
wave
length
range
the
moon

radio
observations
of

have
been
made
over
the
range
of

lengths
from

not
all
the

have
used
the
same
procedures
or
made
the
same
assumptions
about
the
lunar
brightness
distribution
when
reducing
the
data
and
this
together
with
differences
in
the
methods
of
calibrating
the
antennae
and
receivers
must
account
for
much
of
the
disagreement
in
the
measured
radio
brightness
temperatures
in
the
observations
at

coates
a
the
diameter
of
the
antenna
beam
was
small
enough
to
allow
resolution
of
some
of
the
larger
features
of
the
lunar
surface
and
contour
diagrams
have
been
made
of
the
lunar
brightness
distribution
at
three
lunar
phases
these
observations
indicate
that
the
lunar
maria
heat
up
more
rapidly
and
also
cool
off
more
rapidly
than
do
the
mountainous
regions
mare
imbrium
seems
to
be
an
exception
and
remains
cooler
than
the
regions
which
surround
it
these
contour
diagrams
also
suggest
a
rather
rapid
falloff
in
the
radio
brightness
with
latitude
very
recently
observations
have
been
made
at

wave
length
with

with
a

about

noskova

the
constant
temperature
contours
are
much
smoother
than
those
observed
at
mm
by
coates
a
and
apparently
the
emission
at
mm
is
not
nearly
so
sensitive
to
differences
in
surface
features
such
high
resolution
observations
as
these
are
needed
at
several
wave
lengths
in
order
that
the
radio
emission
of
the
moon
can
be
properly
interpreted
the
observations
of
mayer
mccullough
and
sloanaker
at

and
of
sloanaker
at

have
not
previously
been
published

and
the

were
both

so
that
the

was
known

to
be
the

a
good
approximation
to
the

the

abstract
experiments
were
made
on
an
electric
arc
applying
a
porous
graphite
anode
cooled
by
a
transpiring
gas
argon
thus
the
energy
transferred
from
the
arc
to
the
anode
was
partly
fed
back
into
the
arc
it
was
shown
that
by
proper
anode
design
the
net
energy
loss
of
the
arc
to
the
anode
could
be
reduced
to
approximately
of
the
total
arc
energy
a
detailed
energy
balance
of
the
anode
was
established
the
anode
ablation
could
be
reduced
to
a
negligible
amount
the
dependence
of
the
arc
voltage
upon
the
mass
flow
velocity
of
the
transpirating
gas
was
investigated
for
various
arc
lengths
and
currents
between
amp
and

qualitative
observations
were
made
and
high
speed

pictures
were
taken
to
study

phenomena
in
the

at
various

velocities
introduction
the
high
heat
fluxes
existing
at
the
electrode
surfaces
of
electric
arcs
necessitate
extensive
cooling
to
prevent
electrode
ablation
the
cooling
requirements
are
particularly
severe
at
the
anode
in
free
burning
electric
arcs
for
instance
approximately
of
the
total
arc
power
is
transferred
to
the
anode
giving
rise
to
local
heat
fluxes
in
excess
of
as
measured
by
the
authors
the
exact
value
depending
on
the
arc
atmosphere
in
plasma
generators
as
currently
commercially
available
for
industrial
use
or
as
high
temperature
research
tools
often
more
than
of
the
total
energy
input
is
being
transferred
to
the
cooling
medium
of
the
anode
the
higher
heat
transfer
rates
at
the
anode
compared
with
those
at
the
cathode
can
be
explained
by
the
physical
phenomena
occurring
in
free
burning
arcs
in
plasma
generators
the
superimposed
forced
convection
may
modify
the
picture
somewhat
the
heat
transfer
to
the
anode
is
due
to
the
following
effects
heat
of
condensation
work
function
plus
kinetic
energy
of
the
electrons
impinging
on
the
anode
this
energy
transfer
depends
on
the
current
the
temperature
in
the
arc
column
the
anode
material
and
the
conditions
in
the
anode
sheath
heat
transfer
by
molecular
conduction
as
well
as
by
radiation
from
the
arc
column
the
heat
transfer
to
the
anode
in
free
burning
arcs
is
enhanced
by
a
hot
gas
jet
flowing
from
the
cathode
towards
the
anode
with
velocities
up
this
phenomenon
has
been
experimentally
investigated
in
detail
by
maecker
ref
the
pressure
gradient
producing
the
jet
is
due
to
the
nature
of
the
magnetic
field
in
the
arc
rapid
decrease
of
current
density
from
cathode
to
the
anode
hence
the
flow
conditions
at
the
anode
of
free
burning
arcs
resemble
those
near
a
stagnation
point
it
is
apparent
from
the
above
and
from
experimental
evidence
that
the
cooling
requirements
for
the
anode
of
free
burning
arcs
are
large
compared
with
those
for
the
cathode
the
gas
flow
through
a
plasma
generator
will
modify
these
conditions
however
the
anode
is
still
the
part
receiving
the
largest
heat
flux
an
attempt
to
improve
the
life
of
the
anodes
or
the
efficiency
of
the
plasma
generators
must
therefore
aim
at
a
reduction
of
the
anode
loss
the
following
possibilities
exist
for
achieving
this
the
use
of
high
voltages
and
low
currents
by
proper
design
to
reduce
electron
heat
transfer
to
the
anode
for
a
given
power
output
continuous
motion
of
the
arc
contact
area
at
the
anode
by
flow
or
magnetic
forces
feed
back
of
the
energy
transferred
to
the
anode
by
applying
gas
transpiration
through
the
anode
the
third
method
was
to
our
knowledge
successfully
applied
for
the
first
time
by
c

co
workers
ref
the
purpose
of
the
present
study
is
to
study
the
thermal
conditions
and
to
establish
an
energy
balance
for
a
transpiration
cooled
anode
as
well
as
the
effect
of
blowing
on
the
arc
voltage
gas
injection
through
a
porous
anode
transpiration
cooling
not
only
feeds
back
the
energy
transferred
to
the
anode
by
the
above
mentioned
processes
but
also
modifies
the
conditions
in
the
arc
itself
a
detailed
study
of
this
latter
phenomenon
was
not
attempted
in
this
paper
argon

a

transpiration
cooled

with

the
anode
holder
shown
in
figure
was
designed
with
two
goals
in
mind
the
heat
losses
of
the
holder
were
to
be
reduced
as
far
as
possible
and
they
should
be
such
that
an
accurate
heat
balance
can
be
made
in
order
to
reduce
the
number
of
variable
parameters
all
experiments
were
made
with
a
constant
arc
length
of
and
a
current
of
amp
the
argon
flow
through
the
porous
anode
was
varied
systematically
between
and
the
lower
limit
was
determined
by
the
fact
that
for
smaller
flow
rates
the
arc
started
to
strike
to
the
anode
holder
instead
of
to
the
porous
graphite
plug
and
that
it
became
highly
unstable
the
upper
limit
was
determined
by
the
difficulty
of
measuring
the
characteristic
anode
surface
temperature
see
below
since
only
a
small
region
of
the
anode
was
struck
by
the
arc
this
region
which
had
a
higher
temperature
than
the
rest
of
the
anode
surface
changed
size
and
location
continuously
for
each
mass
flow
rate
the
arc
voltage
was
measured
to
measure
the
surface
temperature
of
the
anode
plug
the
surface
was
scanned
with
a
pyrometer
as
it
turned
out
a
very
hot
region
occurred
on
the
plug
its
temperature
was
denoted
by
the
size
of
this
hot
region
was
estimated
by
eye
the
rest
of
the
surface
had
a
temperature
which
decreased
towards
the
outer
diameter
of
the
plug
the
mean
temperature
of
this
region
was
approximated
by
the
temperature
measured
halfways
between
the
edge
of
the
hot
spot
and
the
rim
of
the
plug
it
was
denoted
by
the
mean
temperature
of
the
surface
was
then
computed
according
to
the
following
relation
where
x
is
the
fraction
of
the
plug
area
covered
by
the
hot
spot
assuming
thermal
equilibrium
between
the
anode
surface
and
the
transpiring
argon
the
gas
enthalpy
rise
through
the
anode
was
calculated
according
to
the
relation
whereby
the
specific
heat
of
argon
was
taken
as
this
calculation
results
in
an
enthalpy
rise
which
is
somewhat
high
because
it
assumes
a
mass
flow
equally
distributed
over
the
plug
cross
section
whereas
in
reality
the
mass
velocity
is
expected
to
be
smaller
in
the
regions
of
higher
temperatures
the
upstream
gas
temperature
measured
with
the
thermocouple
shown
in
figure
was
the
values
are
listed
in
table
together
with
the
measured
surface
temperatures
and
arc
voltages
simultaneously
with
the
anode
surface
temperature
and
voltage
measurements
pyrometer
readings
were
taken
along
the
cylindrical
surface
of
the
carbon
anode
holder
as
indicated
on
figure
some
of
these
temperatures
are
plotted
in
figure
they
showed
no
marked
dependence
on
the
flow
rate
within
the
accuracy
of
these
measurements
thus
the
dotted
line
shown
in
figure
was
taken
as
typical
for
the
temperature
distribution
for
all
blowing
rates
the
thermocouples
in
the
aluminum
disk
shown
in
figure
indicated
an
equilibrium
temperature
of
the
surface
of
this
temperature
was
taken
as
environmental
temperature
to
which
the
anode
holder
was
exposed
as
far
as
radiation
is
concerned
it
is
sufficiently
small
compared
with
the
surface
temperature
of
the
anode
holder
to
make
the
energy
flux
radiated
from
the
environment
toward
the
anode
holder
negligible
within
the
accuracy
of
the
present
measurements
the
reflection
of
radiation
originating
from
the
anode
holder
and
reflected
back
to
it
by
the
surrounding
metal
surfaces
should
also
be
small
because
of
the
specular
characteristic
of
the
metal
surfaces
and
of
the
specific
geometry
the
total
heat
loss
through
the
anode
holder
included
also
the
heat
conducted
through
the
base
of
the
cylindrical
piece
into
the
adjacent
metal
parts
it
was
calculated
from
the
temperature
gradient
at
inch
as
the
total
heat
flux
from
the
porous
plug
into
the
plug
holder
is
thereby
the
temperature

all

rates

calculated
analogously

a

viscometer
is

of
two
blocks

held
apart
by

there
is
a
small
well
in
the
top
in
which
the
fluid

paste
to
be
tested
is
placed
a

of

to
be
tested
between
the
blocks
after
it
has
reached
terminal
velocity
the
time
for
the

to
travel
a
known
distance
is
recorded
by
the
use
of
various
weights
data
for
a

graph
can
be
obtained
the
instrument
used
for
this
work
was
a
slight
modification
of
that
previously
described
in
this
test
a
tape
was
pulled
between
the
blocks
with
a
motor
and
pulley
at
a
rate
of
with
a
clearance
of
on
each
side
of
the
tape
this
gives
a
rate
of
shear
of
this
however
can
only
be
considered
approximate
as
the
diameter
of
the
pulley
was
increased
by
the
build
up
of
tape
and
the
tape
was
occasionally
removed
from
the
pulley
during
the
runs
the
face
of
one
block
contained
a
hole
in
diameter
which
led
to
a
manometer
for
the
measurement
of
the
normal
pressure
although
there
were
only
four
fluids
tested
it
was
apparent
that
there
were
two
distinct
types
two
of
the
fluids
showed
a
high
positive
normal
pressure
when
undergoing
shear
and
two
showed
small
negative
pressures
which
were
negligible
in
comparison
with
the
amount
of
the
positive
pressures
generated
by
the
other
two
figure
shows
the
data
on
a
silicone
fluid
labeled
cps
which
gave
a
high
positive
normal
pressure
although
the
tape
was
run
for
over
hr
a
steady
state
was
not
reached
and
it
was
concluded
that
the
reason
for
this
was
that
the
back
pressure
of
the
manometer
was
built
up
from
the
material
fed
from
between
the
blocks
and
this
was
available
at
a
very
slow
rate
a
system
had
to
be
used
which
did
not
depend
upon
the
feeding
of
the
fluid
into
the
manometer
if
measurements
of
the
normal
pressure
were
to
be
made
in
a
reasonable
time
a
back
pressure
was
then
introduced
and
the
rise
or
fall
of
the
material
in
the
manometer
indicated
which
was
greater
the
normal
pressure
in
the
block
or
the
back
pressure
by
this
method
it
was
determined
that
the
normal
pressure
exerted
by
a
sample
of
polybutene
molecular
weight
reported
to
be
was
over
half
an
atmosphere
the
actual
pressure
was
not
determined
because
the
pressure
was
beyond
the
upper
limit
of
the
apparatus
on
hand
the
two
fluids
which
gave
the
small
negative
pressures
were
polybutenes
with
molecular
weights
which
were
stated
to
be
and
these
are
fluids
which
one
would
expect
to
be
less
viscoelastic
or
more
newtonian
because
of
their
lower
molecular
weight
the
maximum
suction
was
of
test
fluid
measured
from
the
top
of
the
block
and
steady
states
were
apparently
reached
with
these
fluids
it
is
presumed
that
this
negative
head
was
associated
with
some
geometric
factor
of
the
assembly
since
different
readings
were
obtained
with
the
same
fluid
and
the
only
apparent
difference
was
the
assembly
and
disassembly
of
the
apparatus
this
negative
pressure
is
not
explained
by
the
velocity
head
since
this
is
not
sufficient
to
explain
the
readings
by
several
magnitudes
these
experiments
can
be
considered
exploratory
only
however
they
do
demonstrate
the
presence
of
large
normal
pressures
in
the
presence
of
flat
shear
fields
which
were
forecast
by
the
theory
in
the
first
part
of
the
paper
they
also
give
information
which
will
aid
in
the
design
of
a
more
satisfactory
instrument
for
the
measurement
of
the
normal
pressures
such
an
instrument
would
be
useful
for
the
characterization
of
many
commercial
materials
as
well
as
theoretical
studies
the
elasticity
as
a
parameter
of
fluids
which
is
not
subject
to
simple
measurement
at
present
and
it
is
a
parameter
which
is
probably
varying
in
an
unknown
manner
with
many
commercial
materials
such
an
instrument
is
expected
to
be
especially
useful
if
it
could
be
used
to
measure
the
elasticity
of
heavy
pastes
such
as
printing
inks
paints
adhesives
molten
plastics
and
bread
dough
for
the
elasticity
is
related
to
those
various
properties
termed
length
shortness
spinnability
etc
which
are
usually
judged
by
subjective
methods
at
present
the
actual
change
caused
by
a
shear
field
is
calculated
by
multiplying
the
pressure
differential
times
the
volume
just
as
it
is
for
any
gravitational
or
osmotic
pressure
head
if
the
volume
is
the
molal
volume
then
is
obtained
on
a
molal
basis
which
is
the
customary
terminology
of
the
chemists
although
the
calculation
is
obvious
by
analogy
with
that
for
gravitational
field
and
osmotic
pressure
it
is
interesting
to
confirm
it
by
a
method
which
can
be
generalized
to
include
related
effects
consider
a
shear
field
with
a
height
of
h
and
a
cross
sectional
area
of
a
opposed
by
a
manometer
with
a
height
of
h
referred
to
the
same
base
as
h
and
a
cross
sectional
area
of
a
if
is
the
change
per
unit
volume
in
gibbs
function
caused
by
the
shear
field
at
constant
p
and
t
and
is
the
density
of
the
fluid
then
the
total
potential
energy
of
the
system
above
the
reference
height
is
is
the
work
necessary
to
fill
the
manometer
column
from
the
reference
height
to
h
the
total
volume
of
the
system
above
the
reference
height
is
and
h
can
be
eliminated
to
obtain
an
equation
for
the
total
potential
energy
of
the
system
in
terms
of
h
the
minimum
total
potential
energy
is
found
by
taking
the
derivative
with
respect
to
h
and
equating
to
zero
this
gives
which
is
the
pressure
this
is
interesting
for
it
combines
both
the
thermodynamic
concept
of
a
minimum
gibbs
function
for
equilibrium
and
minimum
mechanical
potential
energy
for
equilibrium
this
method
can
be
extended
to
include
the
concentration
differences
caused
by
shear
fields
the
relation
between
osmotic
pressure
and
the
gibbs
function
may
also
be
developed
in
an
analogous
way
in
the
above
development
we
have
applied
the
thermodynamics
of
equilibrium
referred
to
by
some
as
thermostatics
to
the
steady
state
this
can
be
justified
thermodynamically
in
this
case
and
this
will
be
done
in
a
separate
paper
which
is
being
prepared
this
has
an
interesting
analogy
with
the
assumption
stated
by
philippoff
that
the
deformational
mechanics
of
elastic
solids
can
be
applied
to
flowing
solutions
there
is
one
exception
to
the
above
statement
as
has
been
pointed
out
and
that
is
that
fluids
can
relax
by
flowing
into
fields
of
lower
rates
of
shear
so
the
statement
should
be
modified
by
stating
that
the
mechanics
are
similar
if
the
mechanics
are
similar
we
can
also
infer
that
the
thermodynamics
will
also
be
similar
the
concept
of
the
strain
energy
as
a
gibbs
function
difference
and
exerting
a
force
normal
to
the
shearing
face
is
compatible
with
the
information
obtained
from
optical
birefringence
studies
of
fluids
undergoing
shear
essentially
these
birefringence
studies
show
that
at
low
rates
of
shear
a
tension
is
present
at
to
the
direction
of
shear
and
as
the
rate
of
shear
increases
the
direction
of
the
maximum
tension
moves
asymptotically
toward
the
direction
of
shear
according
to
philippoff
the
recoverable
shear
s
is
given
by
where
is
the
angle
of
extinction
from
this
and
the
force
of
deformation
it
should
be
possible
to
calculate
the
elastic
energy
of
deformation
which
should
be
equal
to
the
calculated
from
the
pressure
normal
to
the
shearing
face
there
is
another
means
which
should
show
the
direction
and
relative
value
of
the
stresses
in
viscoelastic
fluids
that
is
not
mentioned
as
such
in
the
literature
and
that
is
the
shape
of
the
suspended
drops
of
low
viscosity
fluids
in
shear
fields
these
droplets
are
distorted
by
the
normal
forces
just
as
a
balloon
would
be
pulled
or
pressed
out
of
shape
in
one
s
hands
these
droplets
appear
to
be
ellipsoids
and
it
is
mathematically
convenient
to
assume
that
they
are
if
they
are
not
ellipsoids
the
conclusions
will
be
a
reasonable
approximation
the
direction
of
the
tension
of
minimum
pressure
is
of
course
given
by
the
direction
of
the
major
axis
of
the
ellipsoids
mason
and
taylor
both
show
that
the
major
axis
of
the
ellipsoids
is
at
at
low
rates
of
shear
and
that
it
approaches
the
direction
of
shear
with
increased
rates
of
shear
some
suspensions
break
up
before
they
are
near
to
the
direction
of
shear
and
some
become
asymptotic
to
it
without
breakup
this
is
of
course
a
similar
type
of
behavior
to
that
indicated
by
birefringence
studies
the
relative
forces
can
be
calculated
from
the
various
radii
of
curvature
if
we
assume
a
the
surface
tension
is
uniform
on
the
surface
of
the
drop
b
that
because
of
the
low
viscosity
of
the
fluid
the
internal
pressure
is
the
same
in
all
directions
c
the
kinetic
effects
are
negligible
d
since
the
shape
of
the
drop
conforms
to
the
force
field
it
does
not
appreciably
affect
the
distribution
of
forces
in
the
fluid
these
are
reasonable
assumptions
with
low
viscosity
fluids
suspended
in
high
viscosity
fluids
which
are
subjected
to
low
rates
of
shear
just
as
the
pressure
exerted
by
surface
tension
in
a
spherical
drop
is
and
the
pressure
exerted
by
surface
tension
on
a
cylindrical
shape
is
the
pressure
exerted
by
any
curved
surface
is
where
is
the
interfacial
tension
and
and
are
the
two
radii
of
curvature
this
formula
is
given
by
rumscheidt
and
mason
if
a
is
the
major
axis
of
an
ellipsoid
and
b
and
c
are
the
other
two
axes
the
radius
of
curvature
in
the
ab
plane
at
the
end
of
the
axis
is
and
the
difference
in
pressure
along
the
a
and
b
axes
is
there
are
no
data
published
in
the
literature
on
the
shape
of
low
viscosity
drops
to
confirm
the
above
formulas
however
there
are
photographs
of
suspended
drops
of
cyclohexanol
phthalate
viscosity
poises
suspended
in
corn
syrup
of
poises
in
a
paper
by
mason
and
bartok
this
viscosity
of
the
material
in
the
drops
is
of
course
not
negligible
measurements
on
the
photograph
in
this
paper
give
at
the
maximum
rate
of
shear
of
if
it
is
assumed
that
the
formula
given
by
lodge
of
cosec
applies
the
pressure
difference
along
the
major
axes
can
be
calculated
from
the
angle
of
inclination
of
the
major
axis
and
from
this
the
interfacial
tension
can
be
calculated
its
value
was
from
the
above
data
this
appears
to
be
high
as
would
be
expected
from
the
appreciable
viscosity
of
the
material
in
the
drops
it
is
appropriate
to
call
attention
to
certain
thermodynamic
properties
of
an
ideal
gas
that
are
analogous
to
rubber
like
deformation
the
internal
energy
of
an
ideal
gas
depends
on
temperature
only
and
is
independent
of
pressure
or
volume
in
other
words
if
an
ideal
gas
is
compressed
and
kept
at
constant
temperature
the
work
done
in
compressing
it
is
completely
converted
into
heat
and
transferred
to
the
surrounding
heat
sink
this
means
that
work
equals
q
which
in
turn
equals
there
is
a
well
known
relationship
between
probability
and
entropy
which
states
that
where
q
is
the
probability
that
state
i
e
volume
for
an
ideal
gas
could
be
reached
by
chance
alone
this
is
known
as
conformational
entropy
this
conformational
entropy
is
in
this
case
equal
to
the
usual
entropy
for
there
are
no
other
changes
or
other
energies
involved
note
that
though
the
ideal
gas
itself
contains
no
additional
energy
the
compressed
gas
does
exert
an
increased
pressure
the
energy
for
any
isothermal
work
done
by
the
perfect
gas
must
come
as
thermal
energy
from
its
surroundings
a

as

to

the

and
over
the
range
of

gauss
and

the

increases
with
increasing
and
decreasing
t
an
isotropic

shift
of
to

indicates
a

the

of

is
used
to
derive

the

the

of
the

remains
in

introduction
the
magnetic
moment
of
an
unpaired
electron
associated
nearby
may
have
a
tremendous
influence
on
the
magnetic
resonance
properties
of
nuclei
it
is
important
to
consider
and
experimentally
verify
this
influence
since
quantitative
nuclear
resonance
is
becoming
increasingly
used
in
investigations
of
structure
appeared
to
be
well
suited
for
the
study
of
these
matters
since
it
is
a
normal
paramagnet
with
three
unpaired
electrons
on
the
chromium
its
crystal
structure
is
very
simple
and
the
unknown
position
of
the
hydrogen
in
the
strong
bond
provides
structural
interest
we
first
discuss
the
bond
in
we
then
outline
the
theory
of
the
interaction
of
paramagnetic
dipoles
with
nuclei
and
show
that
the
theory
is
in
excellent
agreement
with
experiment
indeed
it
is
possible
to
separate
electron
paramagnetic
from
nuclear
effects
the
information
provided
by
the
electron
paramagnetic
effects
is
then
discussed
and
finally
the
nuclear
effects
are
interpreted
in
terms
of
various
motional
modified
models
of
the
bond
in
bond
in
theoretical
studies
of
the
hydrogen
bond
generally
agree
that
the
bond
will
be
linear
in
the
absence
of
peculiarities
of
packing
in
the
solid
moreover
it
will
be
asymmetric
until
a
certain
critical
distance
is
reached
below
which
it
will
become
symmetric
there
is
ample
evidence
from
many
sources
that
the
bond
in
is
symmetric
the
distance
in
is
a
there
is
evidence
though
less
convincing
than
for
that
the
bond
in
nickel
dimethylglyoxime
is
symmetric
here
the
distance
is
a
a
number
of
semiempirical
estimates
by
various
workers
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
bond
becomes
symmetric
when
the
bond
length
is
about
to
a
but
aside
from
the
possible
example
of
nickel
dimethylglyoxime
there
have
been
no
convincing
reports
of
symmetric
bonds
douglass
has
studied
the
crystal
structure
of
by
x
ray
diffraction
he
finds
the
structure
contains
an
bond
with
the
distance
of
there
is
then
the
possibility
that
this
bond
is
symmetric
although
douglass
was
unable
to
determine
its
symmetry
from
his
x
ray
data
douglass
found
to
be
trigonal
laue
symmetry
with
x
ray
and
experimental
density
showed
one
formula
unit
in
the
unit
cell
corresponding
to
a
paramagnetic
ion
density
of
the
x
ray
data
did
not
permit
douglass
to
determine
uniquely
the
space
group
but
a
negative
test
for
piezoelectricity
led
him
to
assume
a
center
of
symmetry
under
this
assumption
the
space
group
must
be
and
the
following
are
the
positions
of
the
atoms
in
the
unit
cell
this
space
group
requires
the
hydrogen
bond
to
be
symmetric
douglass
found
powder
intensity
calculations
and
measurements
to
agree
best
for
these
data
lead
to
a
structure
in
which
sheets
of
cr
atoms
lie
between
two
sheets
of
o
atoms
the
o
atoms
in
each
sheet
are
close
packed
and
each
cr
atom
is
surrounded
by
a
distorted
octahedron
of
o
atoms
the
layers
are
stacked
normal
to
the
axis
with
the
lower
oxygens
of
one
layer
directly
above
the
upper
oxygens
of
the
neighboring
lower
layer
in
such
a
manner
that
the
repeat
is
every
three
layers
the
separate
layers
are
joined
together
by
hydrogen
bonds
a
drawing
of
the
structure
is
to
be
found
in
reference
the
gross
details
of
the
structure
appear
reasonable
the
structure
appears
to
be
unique
among
r
ooh
compounds
but
is
the
same
as
that
assumed
by
the
bond
angles
and
distances
are
all
within
the
expected
limits
and
the
volume
per
oxygen
is
about
normal
however
the
possible
absence
of
a
center
of
symmetry
not
only
moves
the
hydrogen
atom
off
but
also
allows
the
oxygen
atoms
to
become
nonequivalent
with
at
and
at
space
group
where
represents
the
oxygens
on
one
side
of
the
layers
and
those
on
the
other
side
however
any
oxygen
nonequivalence
would
shorten
either
the
already
extremely
short
interlayer
distance
of
a
or
the
non
hydrogen
bonded
interlayer
interactions
which
are
already
quite
short
at
a
hence
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
packing
of
the
atoms
in
this
material
in
which
the
oxygen
atoms
are
far
from
geometrical
equivalence
the
only
effect
of
lack
of
a
center
would
then
be
to
release
the
hydrogen
atoms
to
occupy
general
rather
than
special
positions
along
the
axis
if
the
bond
is
linear
then
there
are
three
reasonable
positions
for
the
hydrogen
atoms
the
hydrogen
atoms
are
centered
and
hence
all
lie
on
a
sheet
midway
between
the
oxygen
sheets
all
hydrogen
atoms
lie
on
a
sheet
but
the
sheet
is
closer
to
one
oxygen
sheet
than
to
the
other
hydrogen
atoms
are
asymmetrically
placed
either
randomly
or
in
an
ordered
way
so
that
some
hydrogen
atoms
are
closer
to
the
upper
oxygen
atoms
while
others
are
closer
to
the
lower
oxygen
atoms
position
appears
to
us
to
be
unlikely
in
view
of
the
absence
of
a
piezoelectric
effect
and
on
general
chemical
structural
grounds
a
randomization
of
ups
and
downs
is
more
likely
than
ordered
ups
and
downs
in
position
since
the
hydrogen
atoms
are
well
separated
and
so
the
position
of
one
could
hardly
affect
the
position
of
another
and
also
since
ordered
up
and
down
implies
a
larger
unit
cell
for
which
no
evidence
exists
therefore
the
only
unknown
structural
feature
would
appear
to
be
whether
the
hydrogen
atoms
are
located
symmetrically
or
asymmetrically

polyphosphates
gave
renewed
life
to
soap
products
at
a
time
when
surfactants
were
a
threat
though
expensive
and
these
same
polyphosphates
spelled
the
decline
of
soap
usage
when
the
synergism
between
polyphosphates
and
synthetic
detergent
actives
was
recognized
and
exploited
the
market
today
for
detergent
builders
is
quite
diverse
the
best
known
field
of
application
for
builders
is
in
heavy
duty
spray
dried
detergent
formulations
for
household
use
these
widely
advertised
products
which
are
used
primarily
for
washing
clothes
are
based
on
high
sudsing
synthetic
organic
actives
sodium
alkylbenzenesulfonates
and
contain
up
to
by
weight
of
sodium
tripolyphosphate
or
a
mixture
of
sodium
tripolyphosphate
and
tetrasodium
pyrophosphate
in
the
household
market
there
are
also
low
sudsing
detergent
formulations
based
on
nonionic
actives
with
about
the
same
amount
of
phosphate
builder
light
duty
synthetic
detergents
with
much
less
builder
and
the
dwindling
built
soap
powders
as
well
as
soap
flakes
and
granules
none
of
which
are
now
nationally
advertised
a
well
publicized
entrant
which
has
achieved
success
only
recently
is
the
built
liquid
detergent
with
which
the
major
problem
today
is
incorporation
of
builder
and
active
into
a
small
volume
using
a
sufficiently
high
builder
active
ratio
hard
surface
cleaning
in
household
application
is
represented
by
two
classes
of
alkaline
products
the
formulations
made
expressly
for
machine
dishwashers
and
the
general
purpose
cleaners
used
for
walls
and
woodwork
the
better
quality
products
in
both
of
these
lines
contain
phosphate
builders
in
addition
many
of
the
hard
surface
cleaners
used
for
walls
and
woodwork
had
their
genesis
in
trisodium
orthophosphate
which
is
still
the
major
ingredient
of
a
number
of
such
products
many
scouring
powders
now
also
contain
phosphates
these
hard
surface
cleaners
are
discussed
in
chapter
the
cleaning
process
cleaning
or
detergent
action
is
entirely
a
matter
of
surfaces
wet
cleaning
involves
an
aqueous
medium
a
solid
substrate
soil
to
be
removed
and
the
detergent
or
surface
active
material
an
oversimplified
differentiation
between
soft
and
hard
surface
cleaning
lies
in
the
magnitude
and
kind
of
surface
involved
one
gram
of
cotton
has
been
found
to
have
a
specific
surface
area
of
in
contrast
a
metal
coupon
in
size
would
have
a
magnitude
from
to
a
million
less
even
here
there
is
room
for
some
variation
for
metal
surfaces
vary
in
smoothness
absorptive
capacity
and
chemical
reactivity
spring
used
a
brush
surface
analyzer
in
a
metal
cleaning
study
and
showed
considerable
differences
in
soil
removal
depending
upon
surface
roughness
there
are
considerable
differences
between
the
requirements
for
textile
and
hard
surface
cleaning
exclusive
of
esthetic
values
such
as
high
or
low
foam
level
perfume
content
etc
the
requirements
for
the
organic
active
used
in
washing
textiles
are
high
no
matter
how
they
are
formulated
a
large
number
of
organic
actives
are
simply
not
suitable
for
this
application
since
they
do
not
give
adequate
soil
removal
this
is
best
demonstrated
by
practical
washing
tests
in
which
cloth
articles
are
repeatedly
washed
with
the
same
detergent
formulation
a
good
formulation
will
keep
the
clothes
clean
and
white
after
many
washings
whereas
with
a
poor
formulation
the
clothes
exhibit
a
build
up
of
tattle
tale
grey
and
dirty
spots
sometimes
with
bad
results
even
after
the
first
wash
since
practical
washing
procedures
are
both
lengthy
and
expensive
a
number
of
laboratory
tests
have
been
developed
for
the
numerical
evaluation
of
detergents
harris
has
indicated
that
two
devices
the
launder
ometer
and
terg
o
tometer
are
most
widely
used
for
rapid
detergent
testing
and
he
has
listed
the
commercially
available
standard
soiled
fabrics
also
given
are
several
laboratory
wash
procedures
in
general
use
the
soiled
fabrics
used
for
rapid
testing
of
detergent
formulations
are
made
in
such
a
way
that
only
part
of
the
soil
is
removed
by
even
the
best
detergent
formulation
in
a
single
wash
in
this
way
numerical
values
for
the
relative
efficacy
of
various
detergent
formulations
can
be
obtained
by
measuring
the
reflectance
whiteness
of
the
cloth
swatches
before
and
after
washing
soil
redeposition
is
evaluated
by
washing
clean
swatches
with
the
dirty
ones
as
is
the
case
with
the
surface
active
agent
the
requirements
for
builders
to
be
used
in
detergent
compositions
for
washing
textiles
are
also
high
large
numbers
of
potential
builders
have
been
investigated
but
none
have
been
found
to
be
as
effective
as
the
polyphosphates
over
the
relatively
wide
range
of
conditions
met
in
practice
the
problems
of
hard
surface
cleaning
are
not
nearly
as
complex
in
hard
surface
cleaning
the
inorganic
salts
are
more
important
than
the
organic
active
indeed
when
the
proper
inorganic
constituents
are
employed
practically
any
wetting
or
surface
active
agent
will
do
a
reasonably
good
job
when
present
in
sufficient
amount
in
a
hard
surface
cleaning
formulation
hydroxides
orthophosphates
borates
carbonates
and
silicates
are
important
inorganic
ingredients
of
hard
surface
cleaners
in
addition
the
polyphosphates
are
also
used
probably
acting
more
as
peptizing
agents
than
anything
else
the
importance
of
the
inorganic
constituents
in
hard
surface
cleaning
has
been
emphasized
in
a
number
of
papers
physical
chemistry
of
washing
although
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
process
of
washing
fabrics
involves
a
number
of
phenomena
which
are
related
together
in
an
extremely
complicated
way
and
that
these
phenomena
and
their
interrelations
are
not
well
understood
at
the
present
this
section
attempts
to
present
briefly
an
up
to
date
picture
of
the
physical
chemistry
of
washing
either
fabrics
or
hard
surfaces
the
purpose
of
washing
is
obviously
to
remove
soils
which
are
arbitrarily
classed
in
the
four
major
categories
given
below
dirt
which
is
here
defined
as
particulate
material
which
is
usually
inorganic
and
is
very
often
extremely
finely
divided
so
as
to
exhibit
colloidal
properties
greasy
soils
which
are
typified
by
hydrocarbons
and
fats
esters
of
glycerol
with
long
chain
organic
acids
stains
which
include
the
wide
variety
of
nonparticulate
materials
which
give
color
even
when
present
in
very
low
concentration
on
the
soiled
object
miscellaneous
soils
which
primarily
include
sticky
substances
and
colorless
liquids
which
evaporate
to
leave
a
residue
the
dirt
on
the
soiled
objects
is
mechanically
held
by
surface
irregularities
to
some
extent
however
a
major
factor
in
binding
dirt
is
the
attraction
between
surfaces
that
goes
under
the
name
of
van
der
waal
s
forces
this
is
a
theoretically
complicated
dipole
interaction
which
causes
any
extremely
small
uncharged
particle
to
agglomerate
with
other
small
uncharged
particles
or
to
stick
to
an
uncharged
surface
obviously
if
colloidal
particles
bear
charges
of
opposite
sign
or
if
one
kind
is
charged
and
the
other
kind
is
not
the
attraction
will
be
intensified
and
the
tendency
to
agglomerate
will
be
greatly
reinforced
likewise
a
charged
particle
will
tend
to
stick
to
an
uncharged
surface
and
vice
versa
and
a
charged
particle
will
be
very
strongly
attracted
to
a
surface
exhibiting
an
opposite
charge
in
addition
dirt
particles
can
be
held
onto
a
soiled
surface
by
sticky
substances
or
by
the
surface
tension
of
liquids
including
liquid
greases
greases
stains
and
miscellaneous
soils
are
usually
sorbed
onto
the
soiled
surface
in
most
cases
these
soils
are
taken
up
as
liquids
through
capillary
action
in
an
essentially
static
system
an
oil
can
not
be
replaced
by
water
on
a
surface
unless
the
interfacial
tensions
of
the
water
phase
are
reduced
by
a
surface
active
agent
the
washing
process
whereby
soils
are
removed
consists
basically
of
applying
mechanical
action
to
loosen
the
dirt
particles
and
dried
matter
in
the
presence
of
water
which
helps
to
float
off
the
debris
and
acts
to
some
extent
as
a
dissolving
and
solvating
agent
greasy
soils
are
hardly
removed
by
washing
in
plain
water
and
natural
waters
in
addition
often
contain
impurities
such
as
calcium
salts
which
can
react
with
soils
to
make
them
more
difficult
to
remove
therefore
detergents
are
used
the
detergent
active
is
that
substance
which
primarily
acts
to
remove
greasy
soils
the
other
constituents
in
a
built
detergent
assist
in
this
and
in
the
removal
of
dirty
stains
and
the
hydrophilic
sticky
or
dried
soils
as
is
well
known
detergent
actives
belong
to
the
chemical
class
consisting
of
moderately
high
molecular
weight
and
highly
polar
molecules
which
exhibit
the
property
of
forming
micelles
in
solution
physicochemical
investigations
of
anionic
surfactants
including
the
soaps
have
shown
that
there
is
little
polymerization
or
agglomeration
of
the
chain
anions
below
a
certain
region
of
concentration
called
the
critical
micelle
concentration
below
the
critical
micelle
concentration
monomers
and
some
dimers
are
present
in
the
critical
micelle
region
there
is
a
rapid
agglomeration
or
polymerization
to
give
the
micelles
which
have
a
degree
of
polymerization
averaging
around
for
anionics
these
micelles
appear
to
be
roughly
spherical
assemblages
in
which
the
hydrocarbon
tails
come
together
so
that
the
polar
groups
the
ionized
ends
face
outward
towards
the
aqueous
continuous
phase
obviously
hydrophobic
oleophilic
substances
such
as
greases
oils
or
particles
having
a
greasy
or
oily
surface
are
more
at
home
in
the
center
of
a
micelle
than
in
the
aqueous
phase
micelles
can
imbibe
and
hold
a
considerable
amount
of
oleophilic
substances
so
that
the
micelle
volume
may
be
increased
as
much
as
approximately
two
fold
although
the
matter
has
not
been
unequivocally
demonstrated
the
available
data
show
that
micelles
in
themselves
do
not
contribute
significantly
to
the
detergency
process
related
to
micelle
formation
is
the
technologically
important
ability
of
detergent
actives
to
congregate
at
oil
water
interfaces
in
such
a
manner
that
the
polar
or
ionized
end
of
the
molecule
is
directed
towards
the
aqueous
phase
and
the
hydrocarbon
chain
towards
the
oily
phase
in
the
cleaning
process
sorbed
greasy
soils
become
coated
in
this
manner
with
an
oriented
film
of
surfactant
then
during
washing
the
greasy
soil
rolls
back
at
the
edges
so
that
emulsified
droplets
can
disengage
themselves
from
the
sorbed
oil
mass
with
the
aid
of
mechanical
action
and
enter
the
aqueous
phase
obviously
a
substance
which
is
permanently
or
temporarily
sorbed
on
the
surface
in
place
of
the
soil
will
tend
to
accelerate
this
process
and
effectively
push
off
the
greasy
soil
substances
other
than
detergent
actives
also
tend
to
be
strongly
sorbed
from
aqueous
media
onto
surfaces
of
other
contiguous
condensed
phases
this
is
particularly
true
of
highly
charged
ions
especially
those
ions
which
fall
into
the
class
of
polyelectrolytes
whereas
the
usual
organic
surface
active
agent
is
strongly
sorbed
at
oil
water
interfaces
the
highly
charged
ions
are
most
strongly
sorbed
at
interfaces
between
water
and
insoluble
materials
exhibiting
an
ionic
structure
see
table
on
p
thus
for
aqueous
media
we
can
think
of
the
idealized
organic
active
as
an
oleophilic
or
hydrophobic
surface
active
agent
and
of
an
idealized
builder
as
a
oleophobic
or
hydrophilic
surface
active
agent
from
the
equilibrium
sorption
data
which
are
available
it
seems
logical
to
expect
that
polyphosphate
ions
would
be
strongly
sorbed
on
the
surface
of
the
dirt
especially
clay
soils
so
as
to
give
it
a
greatly
increased
negative
charge
the
charged
particles
then
repel
each
other
and
are
also
repelled
from
the
charged
surface
which
almost
invariably
bears
a
negative
charge
under
washing
conditions
the
negatively
charged
dirt
particles
then
leave
the
surface
and
go
into
the
aqueous
phase
this
hypothesis
is
evolved
in
analogy
to
the
demonstrated
action
of
organic
actives
in
detergency
it
does
not
consider
the
kinetic
effects
of
the
phosphate
builders
on
sorption
desorption
phenomena
which
will
be
discussed
later
see
pp
the
crude
picture
of
the
detergency
process
thus
far
developed
can
be
represented
as
the
influence
of
mechanical
action
on
the
particles
of
free
soil
may
be
compared
to
that
of
kinetic
energy
on
a
molecular
scale
freed
soil
must
be
dispersed
and
protected
against
flocculation
cleaned
cloth
must
be
protected
against
the
redeposition
of
dispersed
soil
it
is
evident
that
the
requirements
imposed
by
these
effects

indeed
there

separate

reactions
between

would
appear
to

fruitful

be
possible
to
determine
unique

for

in

as
well
as

on
the
heat
of

of
the

bond
the
reaction
of
chlorine
with
carbon
tetrachloride
seemed
particularly
suited
for
such
studies
it
should
be
possible
to
prepare
very
pure
chlorine
by
oxidation
of
inorganic
chlorides
on
a
vacuum
system
followed
by
multiple
distillation
of

be

to
free
carbon

of
any
interfering
substances
by
the
usual
purification
methods
followed
by
prechlorination
prior
to
addition
of
radioactive
chlorine
furthermore
the
exchange
would
not
be
expected
to
be
sensitive
to
trace
amounts
of
impurities
because
it
would
not
be
apt
to
be
a
chain
reaction
since
the
activation
energy
for
abstraction
of
chlorine
by
a
chlorine
atom
would
be
expected
to
be
too
high
also
it
would
be
expected
that
would
compete
very
effectively
with
any
impurities
as
a
scavenger
for
radicals
contrary
to
these
expectations
we
have
found
it
impossible
to
obtain
the

of

would
wish
even
with

often
differed

a
systematic

was
undertaken
to
see
whether
the
difficulty
could
be
ascribed
to
the
method
of
preparing

no
correlation
between
these

was
found
the
reaction

observed
at
ranged
from
of
the
chlorine
exchanged

exchange
between

the
improvement
was
most
noticeable
in
the
greater

rather
large

observed
while
dependence
on
the
first
power
of
the
light

seemed
to
be
indicated
in
most
cases
it
was
possible
to
make
estimates
of
the
quantum
yield
by
observing
the
extent
of
reduction
of
a
uranyl
oxalate
actinometer
solution
illuminated
for
a
known

making

conversions
based
on
the
differences
in
the
absorption
spectra
of
uranyl
oxalate
and
of
chlorine
and
considering
the
spectral
distribution
of

these
estimates
indicated
that
the
quantum
yield
for
the
exchange
of
chlorine
with

tetrachloride
at
is
of
the
order
of
magnitude
of

was
also
observed
in

present
at
the

in
the

although
there
was
some
variation
in
results
which
must
be
attributed
either
to
trace
impurities
or
to
variation
in
wall
effects
the
photochemical
exchange
in
the
gas
phase
was
sufficiently
reproducible
so
that
it
seemed
meaningful
to
compare
the
reaction
rates
in
different
series
of
reaction
tubes
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
information
on
the
effect
of

whipple
extends
the

to

both
the

a
resultant
increase
in
both
the
poynting
robertson
effect
and
the
ratio
of
the
repulsive
force
to
the
gravitational
force
the
poynting
robertson
effect
causes
the
semi
major
axis
of
orbits
to
diminish
more
rapidly
than
the
semi
minor
axis
with
a
consequent
tendency
toward
circular
orbits
as
the

move
toward
the

also
planetary
gravitational

the

concentration
near

as
the

is
approached
at
one
astronomical

from

the

orbits
are
probably
nearly
circular
if
such
is
the
case
the
particles
within
a
distance
of
about
km
of
the
earth
will
have
relative
to
the
earth
a
kinetic
energy
less
than
their
potential

they
will
be
captured
into
orbits
about

de
jager
has
calculated
the
times
required
for
these
particles
to
reach
the
atmosphere
under
the
influence
of
the
poynting
robertson
effect
which
in
this
case
causes
the
orbits
to
become
more
and
more
eccentric
without
changing
the
semi
major
axis
this
effect
can
give
rise
to
a
blanket
of
micrometeorites
around
the
earth
since
there
is
a
continual
loss
of
micrometeoritic
material
in
space
because
of
the
radiation
effects
there
must
be
a
continual
replenishment
otherwise
micrometeorites
would
have
disappeared
from
interplanetary
space
there
are
several
possible
sources
according
to
whipple
cometary
debris
is
sufficient
to
replenish
the
material
spiraling
into
the
sun
maintaining
a
fairly
steady
state
asteroidal
collisions
are
also
thought
to
contribute
material
it
is
also
possible
that
some
of
the
dust
in
the
vicinity
of
the
earth
originated
from
meteoritic
impacts
upon
the
moon
direct
measurements
of
micrometeorite
flux
one
can
not
make
a
very
satisfactory
guess
about
the
micrometeorite
flux
in
space
even
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
earth
where
information
has
been
obtained
both
directly
and
indirectly
the
derived
flux
values
vary
by
at
least
four
orders
of
magnitude
this
large
discrepancy
demonstrates
the
inadequacies
of
the
experimental
methods
and
the
lack
of
understanding
of
the
various
phenomena
involved
beyond
a
few
million
kilometers
from
the
earth
but
still
in
the
region
of
the
earth
s
orbit
a
prediction
of
the
flux
of
dust
is
even
more
unreliable
at
greater
distances
from
the
sun
the
situation
is
still
less
certain
there
are
several
sources
of
evidence
on
the
micrometeorite
environment
direct
information
has
been
obtained
from
rockets
and
satellites
equipped
with
impact
sensors
in
addition
the
size
distribution
obtained
from
visual
and
radar
observations
of
meteors
may
be
extrapolated
to
the
micrometeorite
domain
from
the
brightness
of
the
f
component
of
the
solar
corona
and
the
brightness
of
the
zodiacal
light
an
estimate
of
the
particle
sizes
concentrations
and
spatial
distribution
can
be
derived
for
regions
of
space
near
the
ecliptic
plane
another
important
source
of
evidence
only
recently
receiving
much
attention
is
the
analysis
of
atmospheric
dust
for
a
meteoritic
component
the
cores
of
deep
sea
sediments
and
content
of
collectors
in
remote
regions
are
valuable
in
this
category
the
data
provide
a

the

on

from

these

these

have

reliable

for

contribute
some

the

was
for

of

greater
than

this
mass

was
derived
from
the

and

ninety
per

of
the

occurred
between

and

and
from
day
to
day
the
variation
of
the
rate
was
as
much
as
an
order
of
magnitude
one
may
conclude
that
most
of
the
detected
micrometeoritic
material
is
concentrated
in
orbital
streams
which
intersect
the
earth
s
orbit
there
have
been
contradictory

from

the

quoted

and
for

the

less
than
nazarova
the

for
the
first

indicate
a
meteor
stream
with
a
very
high
concentration
of
particles
and
may
have
led
to
the
high
estimates
of
micrometeorite
flux
preliminary
data
from
eta
give
an
average
impact
rate
of
for
masses
larger
than
for
about
events
in
a

lagow

the

varied
by
less
than
a

of
the

not
yet
been
analyzed
for

note
that
the
mass
threshold
is
four
times
that
of
alpha
and
that
the
flux
is
one
fifth
as
large
if
one
assumes
that
the
average
flux
did
not
change
between
measurements
a
mass
distribution
curve
is
obtained
which
relates
the
flux
of
particles
larger
than
a
given
radius
to
the
inverse
power
of
the

space
probes
have
yielded
little
information
pioneer
i
recorded
a
decrease
in
flux
with
distance
from
the
earth
on
the
basis
of
counts
in
hours
with
detectors
sensitive
to
three
mass
intervals
and
based
on
a
few
counts
the
second
and
third
russian
space
probes
indicate
that
the
flux
of
the
smallest
particles
detected
is
less
than
that
of
larger
ones
being
based
on
so
few
events
these
results
are
of
dubious
validity
the
calibration
of
piezoelectric
sensors
in
terms
of
the
particle
parameters
is
very
uncertain
many
workers
believe
that
the
response
is
proportional
to
the
incident
momentum
of
the
particles
a
relation
deduced
from
laboratory
results
linearly
extrapolated
to
meteoritic
velocities
however
one
must
expect
that
vaporization
and
ejection
of
material
by
hypervelocity
impacts
would
cause
a
deviation
from
a
linear
relationship
in
the
united
states
most
of
the
sensors
are
calibrated
by
dropping
small
spheres
on
their
sensitive
surfaces
the
russian
experimenters
claim
that
only
a
small
fraction
of
the
impulse
from
the
sensors
is
caused
by
the
incident
momentum
with
the
remainder
being
momentum
of
ejected
material
from
the
sensor
this
ejection
momentum
is
linearly
related
to
the
particle
energy
they
quote
about
the
same
mass
threshold
as
that
of
the
u
s
apparatus
but
a
momentum
threshold
about
times
greater
there
is
a
difference
in
the
experimental
arrangement
in
that
the
u
s
microphones
are
attached
directly
to
the
vehicle
skin
while
the
russian
instruments
are
isolated
from
the
skin
the
threshold
mass
is
derived
from
the
momentum
threshold
with
the
assumption
of
a
mean
impact
velocity
of
in
the
u
s
work
and
in
the
u
s
s
r
work
the
threshold
mass
of
about
corresponds
to
a
diameter
sphere
of
density
however
the
conversion
from
mass
to
size
is
unreliable
since
many
photographic
meteors
give
evidence
of
a
fluffy
loosely
bound
meteorite
structure
with
densities
as
low
as
to
what
extent
such
low
density
applies
to
micrometeorites
is
unknown
the
velocity
value
used
is
also
open
to
some
question
if
a
substantial
fraction
of
the
dust
is
orbiting
about
the
earth
only
about
one
third
the
above
mentioned
average
velocity
should
be
used
in
deriving
the
mass
zodiacal
light
and
the
gegenschein
give
some
evidence
for
such
a
dust
blanket
a
phenomenon
also
to
be
expected
if
the
dust
before
capture
is
in
circular
orbits
about
the
sun
as
indicated
by
the
trend
of
the
smaller
visible
meteors
the
diurnal
variation
in
the
observed
flux
may
be
partly
due
to
the
dependence
of
the
detector
sensitivity
on
the
incident
velocity
the
flux
of
micrometeorites
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
earth
can
be
estimated
by
extrapolation
from
radar
and
visual
meteor
data
a
summary
of
meteorite
data
prepared
by
whipple
on
the
basis
of
photographic
visual
and
radar
evidence
is
given
in
table
from
an
estimated
mass
of
g
for
a
zero

meteorite
the
other
masses
are
derived
with
the
assumption
of
a
mass
decrease
by
a
factor
of
for
each
unit
increase
in
magnitude
the
radius
is
calculated
from
the
mass
by
assuming
spheres
of
density
except
for
the
smallest
particles
which
must
have
a
higher
mass
density
to
remain
in
the
solar
system
in
the
presence
of
solar
radiation
pressure
the
flux
values
are
for
all
particles
with
masses
greater
than
the
given
mass
and
are
based
on
an
estimate
of
the
numbers
of
visual
meteors
it
is
assumed
that
the
flux
values
increase
by
a
factor
of
per
magnitude
in
accordance
with
the
opinion
that
the
total
mass
flux
in
each
unit
range
in
magnitude
is
constant
the
values
agree
with
the
data
from
alpha
and
eta
the
figures
in
the
next
to
last
column
are
derived
with
the
assumption
of
per

shielding
by
the
earth
hence
these
figures
apply
immediately
above
the
earth
s
atmosphere
the
unshielded
flux
is
given
in
the
last
column
these
figures
constitute
the
best
estimate
for
the
flux
in
interplanetary
space
near
the
earth
of
course
if
there
is
a
dust
blanket
around
the
earth
the
fluxes
in
interplanetary
space
should
be
less
than
the
figures
given
here
note
that
the
mass
scale
is
one
to
two
orders
of
magnitude
greater
than
some
previously
used
for
example
jacchia
derived
a
scale
of

for
a

the
older
scales
were
based
on
theoretical
estimates
of
the
conversion
efficiency
of
kinetic
energy
into
light
the
mass
scale
used
in
table
was
derived
on
the
assumption
that
the
motion
of
the
glowing
trail
is
related
to
the
momentum
transfer
to
the

by
the

eshleman
extrapolation
of
this

agreement
with
the
inverse
power
derived
from

less
than

from

and
the

in

the

may
be
in
error
for
several
reasons
the
observational

determining
the

have
a
range
of
error
which
is

in

biological

is
considered
to
be
primarily
a
strategic
weapon
the
major
reason
for
this
is
that
it
has
no
quick
kill

the

of

a

a

thus
an

would
probably
use
this
weapon
for

on
static

centers
such
as

an
important
operational
procedure
in

for
an

would
be
to
create
an

this

has
stimulated
much
basic
research
concerning
the
behavior
of

the
pathogenesis
of

the
medical
management
of
such

and

the
biological

physical
properties
of
infectious

have
been
studied
intensively
during
the
past
fifteen
years
much
new

and
many
unique
techniques
have
been
developed
for
the
quantitative
exposure
of
experimental
animals
to

of
infectious

contained
in
particles
of
specified

characteristics
much
information
has
been
gathered
relative
to
quantitative
sampling
and
assesment
techniques
much
of
the
older
experimental
work
on
respiratory
infections
was
accomplished
by
very
artificial
procedures
the
intranasal
instillation
of
a
fluid
suspension
of
infectious
agent
in
an
anesthetized
animal
is
far
different
from
exposure
through
natural
respiration
to
aerosolized
organisms
the
importance
of
particle
size
in
such
aerosols
has
been
thoroughly
demonstrated
the
natural
anatomical
and
physiological
defensive
features
of
the
upper
respiratory
tract
such
as
the
turbinates
of
the
nose
and
the
cilia
of
the
trachea
and
larger
bronchi
are
capable
of
impinging
out
the
larger
particles
to
which
we
are
ordinarily
exposed
in
our
daily
existence
very
small
particles
however
in
a
size
range
of
to
microns
in
diameter
are
capable
of
passing
these
impinging
barriers
and
entering
the
alveolar
bed
of
the
lungs
this
area
is
highly
susceptible
to
infection
the
entrance
and
retention
of
infectious
particles
in
the
alveoli
amounts
almost
to
an
intratissue
inoculation
the
relationship
between
particle
size
and
infectious
dose
is
illustrated
in
table
in
considering
bw
defense
it
must
be
recognized
that
a
number
of
critical
meterological
parameters
must
be
met
for
an
aerosol
to
exhibit
optimum
effect
for
example
bright
sunlight
is
rapidly
destructive
for
living
microorganisms
suspended
in
air
there
are
optimal
humidity
requirements
for
various
agents
when
airborne
neutral
or
inversion
meteorological
conditions
are
necessary
for
a
cloud
to
travel
along
the
surface
it
will
rise
during
lapse
conditions
there
are
of
course
certain
times
during
the
hour
daily
cycle
when
most
of
these
conditions
will
be
met
certain
other
properties
of
small
particles
in
addition
to
those
already
mentioned
in
connection
with
penetration
of
the
respiratory
tract
are
noteworthy
in
defense
considerations
the
smaller
the
particle
the
further
it
will
travel
downwind
before
settling
out
an
aerosol
of
such
small
particles
moreover
diffuses
through
structures
in
much
the
same
manner
as
a
gas
there
may
be
a
number
of
secondary
effects
resulting
from
diffusion
through
buildings
such
as
widespread
contamination
of
kitchens
restaurants
food
stores
hospitals
etc
depending
on
the
organism
there
may
be
multiplication
in
some
food
or
beverage
products
i
e
in
milk
for
example
the
secondary
consequences
from
this
could
be
very
serious
and
must
be
taken
into
consideration
in
planning
for
defense
something
of
the
behavior
of
clouds
of
small
particles
can
be
illustrated
by
the
following
field
trials
in
the
first
trial
an
inert
substance
was
disseminated
from
a
boat
travelling
some
ten
miles
off
shore
under
appropriately
selected
meteorological
conditions
zinc
cadmium
sulfide
in
particles
of
microns
in
size
were
disseminated
this
material
fluoresces
under
ultraviolet
light
which
facilitates
its
sampling
and
assessment
four
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
was
disseminated
while
the
ship
was
traveling
a
distance
of
miles
figure
describes
the
results
obtained
in
this
trial
the
particles
traveled
a
maximum
detected
distance
of
some
miles
from
these
dosage
isopleths
it
can
be
seen
that
an
area
of
over
square
miles
was
covered
these
dosages
could
have
been
increased
by
increasing
the
source
strength
which
was
small
in
this
case
the
behavior
of
a
biological
aerosol
on
a
much
smaller
scale
is
illustrated
by
a
specific
field
trial
conducted
with
a
non
pathogenic
organism
an
aqueous
suspension
of
the
spores
of
b
subtilis
var
niger
generally
known
as
bacillus
globigii
was
aerosolized
using
commercially
available
nozzles
a
satisfactory
cloud
was
produced
even
though
these
nozzles
were
only
about
per
cent
efficient
in
producing
an
initial
cloud
in
the
size
range
of
to
microns
in
this
test
gallons
of
a
suspension
having
a
count
of
organisms
per
ml
or
a
total
of
approximately
spores
was
aerosolized
the
spraying
operation
was
conducted
from
the
rear
deck
of
a
small
naval
vessel
cruising
two
miles
off
shore
and
vertical
to
an
on
sure
breeze
spraying
continued
along
a
two
mile
course
this
operation
was
started
at
p
m
and
lasted
for
minutes
there
was
a
slight
lapse
condition
a
moderate
fog
and
per
cent
relative
humidity
a
network
of
sampling
stations
had
been
set
up
on
shore
these
were
located
at
the
homes
of
government
employees
in
government
offices
buildings
and
reservations
within
the
trial
area
a
rough
attempt
was
made
to
characterize
the
vertical
profile
of
the
cloud
by
taking
samples
from
outside
the
windows
on
the
first
ninth
and
fifteenth
floors
of
a
government
office
building
all
samplers
were
operated
for
a
period
of
two
hours
except
one
which
was
operated
for
four
hours
in
this
instance
there
was
a
dosage
of
during
the
first
two
hours
and
a
total
dosage
of
for
the
four
hour
period
a
four
fold
increase
this
suggests
that
the
sampling
period
particularly
at
the
more
distant
locations
should
have
been
increased
as
can
be
seen
from
figure
an
extensive
area
was
covered
by
this
aerosol
the
maximum
distance
sampled
was
miles
from
the
source
as
can
be
seen
from
these
dosage
isopleths
approximately
square
miles
was
covered
within
the
area
sampled
it
is
quite
likely
that
an
even
greater
area
was
covered
particularly
downwind
the
dosages
in
the
three
levels
of
the
vertical
profile
were
this
was
not
of
course
enough
sampling
to
give
a
satisfactory
description
of
the
vertical
diffusion
of
the
aerosol
a
number
of
unique
medical
problems
might
be
created
when
man
is
exposed
to
an
infectious
agent
through
the
respiratory
route
rather
than
by
the
natural
portal
of
entry
some
agents
have
been
shown
to
be
much
more
toxic
or
infectious
to
experimental
animals
when
exposed
to
aerosols
of
optimum
particle
size
than
by
the
natural
portal
botulinal
toxin
for
example
is
several
thousand
fold
more
toxic
by
this
route
than
when
given
per
os
in
some
instances
a
different
clinical
disease
picture
may
result
from
this
route
of
exposure
making
diagnosis
difficult
in
tularemia
produced
by
aerosol
exposure
one
would
not
expect
to
find
the
classical
ulcer
of
rabbit
fever
on
a
finger
an
enemy
would
obviously
choose
an
agent
that
is
believed
to
be
highly
infectious
agents
that
are
known
to
cause
frequent
infections
among
laboratory
workers
such
as
those
causing
q
fever
tularemia
brucellosis
glanders
coccidioidomycosis
etc
belong
in
this
category
an
agent
would
likely
be
selected
which
would
possess
sufficient
viability
and
virulence
stability
to
meet
realistic
minimal
logistic
requirements
it
is
obviously
a
proper
goal
of
research
to
improve
on
this
property
in
this
connection
it
should
be
capable
of
being
disseminated
without
excessive
destruction
moreover
it
should
not
be
so
fastidious
in
its
growth
requirements
as
to
make
production
on
a
militarily
significant
scale
improbable
an
aggressor
would
use
an
agent
against
which
there
was
a
minimal
naturally
acquired
or
artificially
induced
immunity
in
a
target
population
a
solid
immunity
is
the
one
effective
circumstance
whereby
attack
by
a
specific
agent
can
be
neutralized
it
must
be
remembered
however
that
there
are
many
agents
for
which
there
is
no
solid
immunity
and
a
partial
or
low
grade
immunity
may
be
broken
by
an
appropriate
dose
of
agent
there
is
a
broad
spectrum
of
organisms
from
which
selection
for
a
specified
military
purpose
might
be
made
an
enemy
might
choose
an
acutely
debilitating
microorganism
a
chronic
disease
producer
or
one
causing
a
high
rate
of
lethality
it
is
possible
that
certain
mutational
forms
may
be
produced
such
as
antibiotic
resistant
strains
mutants
may
also
be
developed
with
changes
in
biochemical
properties
that
are
of
importance
in
identification
all
of
these
considerations
are
of
critical
importance
in
considering
defense
and
medical
management
biological
agents
are
of
course
highly
host
specific
they
do
not
destroy
physical
structures
as
is
true
of
high
explosives
this
may
be
of
overriding
importance
in
considering
military
objectives
the
question
of
epidemic
disease
merits
some
discussion
only
a
limited
effort
has
been
devoted
to
this
problem
some
of
those
who
question
the
value
of
bw
have
assumed
that
the
only
potential
would
be
in
the
establishment
of
epidemics
they
then
point
out
that
with
our
present
lack
of
knowledge
of
all
the
factors
concerned
in
the
rise
and
fall
of
epidemics
it
is
unlikely
that
a
planned
episode
could
be
initiated
they
argue
further
and
somewhat
contradictorily
that
our
knowledge
and
resources
in
preventive
medicine
would
make
it
possible
to
control
such
an
outbreak
of
disease
this
is
why
this
approach
to
bw
defense
has
not
been
given
major
attention
our
major
problem
is
what
an
enemy
might
accomplish
in
an
initial
attack
on
a
target
this
of
course
does
not
eliminate
from
consideration
for
this
purpose
agents
that
are
associated
naturally
with
epidemic
disease
a
hypothetical
example
will
illustrate
this
point
let
us
assume
that
it
would
be
possible
for
an
enemy
to
create
an
aerosol
of
the
causative
agent
of
epidemic
typhus
rickettsia
prowazwki
over
city
a
and
that
a
large
number
of
cases
of
typhus
fever
resulted
therefrom
no
epidemic
was
initiated
nor
was
one
expected
because
the
population
in
city
a
was
not
lousy
lousiness
is
a
prerequisite
for
epidemic
typhus
in
this
case
then
the
military
objective
was
accomplished
with
an
epidemic
agent
solely
through
the
results
secured
in
the
initial
attack
this
was
done
with
full
knowledge
that
there
would
be
no
epidemic
on
the
other
hand
a
similar
attack
might
have
been
made
on
city
b
whose
population
was
known
to
be
lousy
one
might
expect
some
spread
of
the
disease
in
this
case
resulting
in
increased
effectiveness
of
the
attack
the
major
defensive
problems
are
concerned
with
the
possibility
of
overt
military
delivery
of
biological
agents
from
appropriate
disseminating
devices
it
should
be
no
more
difficult
to
deliver
such
devices
than
other
weapons
the
same
delivery
vehicles
whether
they
be
airplanes
submarines
or
guided
missiles
should
be
usable
if
it
is
possible
for
an
enemy
to
put
an
atomic
bomb
on
a
city
it
should
be
equally
possible
to
put
a
cloud
of
biological
agent
over
that
city
biological
agents
are
moreover
suitable
for
delivery
through
enemy
sabotage
which
imposes
many
problems
in
defense
a
few
obvious
target
areas
of
great
importance
might
be
mentioned
the
air
conditioning
and
ventilating
systems
of
large
buildings
are
subject
to

be
produced
by
the
insoluble
material
from
sera
containing
only
incomplete
antibody
activity
this
was
later
known
to
be
the
result
of
concentrating
the
minute
amount
of
complete
antibody
found
in
these
sera
when
the
insoluble
fraction
was
suspended
in
a
volume
of
saline
equal
to
that
of
the
original
serum
sample
no
complete
antibody
activity
could
be
detected
apart
from
the
honeybee
practically
all
bees
and
bumblebees
hibernate
in
a
state
of
torpor
occasionally
you
may
come
across
one
or
two
bumblebees
in
the
cold
season
when
you
are
turning
over
sods
in
your
garden
but
you
have
to
be
a
really
keen
observer
to
see
them
at
all
they
keep
their
wings
and
feet
pressed
tightly
against
their
bodies
and
in
spite
of
their
often
colorful
attire
you
may
very
well
mistake
them
for
lumps
of
dirt
i
must
add
at
once
that
these
animals
are
what
we
call
queens
young
females
that
have
mated
in
the
previous
summer
or
autumn
it
is
on
them
alone
that
the
future
of
their
race
depends
for
all
their
relatives
mothers
husbands
brothers
and
unmated
sisters
have
perished
with
the
arrival
of
the
cold
weather
even
some
of
the
queens
will
die
before
the
winter
is
over
falling
prey
to
enemies
or
disease
the
survivors
emerge
on
some
nice
sunny
day
in
march
or
april
when
the
temperature
is
close
to
f
and
there
is
not
too
much
wind
now
the
thing
for
us
to
do
is
to
find
ourselves
a
couple
of
those
wonderful
flowering
currants
such
as
the
red
ribes
sanguineum
of
our
pacific
northwest
or
otherwise
a
good
sloe
tree
or
perhaps
some
nice
pussy
willow
in
bloom
preferably
one
with
male
or
staminate
catkins
the
blooms
of
ribes
and
of
the
willow
and
sloe
are
the
places
where
large
numbers
of
our
early
insects
will
assemble
honeybees
bumblebees
and
other
wild
bees
and
also
various
kinds
of
flies
it
is
a
happy
buzzing
crowd
each
male
willow
catkin
is
composed
of
a
large
number
of
small
flowers
it
is
not
difficult
to
see
that
the
stamens
of
the
catkin
are
always
arranged
in
pairs
and
that
each
individual
flower
is
nothing
but
one
such
pair
standing
on
a
green
black
tipped
little
scale
by
scrutinizing
the
flowers
one
can
also
notice
that
the
scale
bears
one
or
two
tiny
warts
those
are
the
nectaries
or
honey
glands
fig
page
the
staminate
willow
catkins
then
provide
their
visitors
with
both
nectar
and
pollen
a
marvelous
arrangement
for
it
provides
exactly
what
the
bee
queens
need
to
make
their
beebread
a
combination
of
honey
and
pollen
with
which
the
young
of
all
species
are
fed
the
only
exception
to
this
is
certain
bees
that
have
become
parasites
i
will
deal
with
these
later
on
quite
often
honeybees
form
a
majority
on
the
willow
catkins
as
we
have
already
seen
in
the
first
chapter
bumblebees
are
bigger
hairier
and
much
more
colorful
than
honeybees
exhibiting
various
combinations
of
black
yellow
white
and
orange
let
us
not
try
to
key
them
out
at
this
stage
of
the
game
and
let
us
just
call
them
bombus
there
must
be
several
dozen
species
in
the
united
states
alone
if
you
really
insist
on
knowing
their
names
an
excellent
book
on
the
north
american
species
is
bumblebees
and
their
ways
by
o
e
plath
if
we
manage
to
keep
track
of
a
bombus
queen
after
she
has
left
her
feeding
place
we
may
discover
the
snug
little
hideout
which
she
has
fixed
up
for
herself
when
she
woke
up
from
her
winter
sleep
as
befits
a
queen
a
bumblebee
female
is
rather
choosy
and
may
spend
considerable
time
searching
for
a
suitable
nesting
place
most
species
seem
to
prefer
a
ready
made
hollow
such
as
a
deserted
mouse
nest
a
bird
house
or
the
hole
made
by
a
woodpecker
some
show
a
definite
liking
for
making
their
nest
in
moss
once
she
has
made
up
her
mind
the
queen
starts
out
by
constructing
in
her
chosen
abode
a
small
floor
of
dried
grass
or
some
woolly
material
on
this
she
builds
an
egg
compartment
or
egg
cell
which
is
filled
with
that
famous
pollen
and
nectar
mixture
called
beebread
she
also
builds
one
or
two
waxen
cups
which
she
fills
with
honey
then
a
group
of
eggs
is
deposited
in
a
cavity
in
the
beebread
loaf
and
the
egg
compartment
is
closed
the
queen
afterward
keeps
incubating
and
guarding
her
eggs
like
a
mother
hen
taking
a
sip
from
time
to
time
from
the
rather
liquid
honey
in
her
honey
pots
when
the
larvae
hatch
they
feed
on
the
beebread
although
they
also
receive
extra
honey
meals
from
their
mother
she
continues
to
add
to
the
pollen
supply
as
needed
the
larvae
kept
warm
by
the
queen
are
full
grown
in
about
ten
days
each
now
makes
a
tough
papery
cocoon
and
pupates
after
another
two
weeks
the
first
young
emerge
four
to
eight
small
daughters
that
begin
to
play
the
role
of
worker
bees
collecting
pollen
and
nectar
in
the
field
and
caring
for
the
new
young
generation
while
the
queen
retires
to
a
life
of
egg
laying
the
first
worker
bees
do
not
mate
or
lay
eggs
males
and
mating
females
do
not
emerge
until
later
in
the
season
the
broods
of
workers
that
appear
later
tend
to
be
bigger
than
the
first
ones
probably
because
they
are
better
fed
by
the
middle
of
the
summer
many
of
the
larvae
apparently
receive
such
a
good
diet
that
it
is
optimal
and
it
is
then
that
young
queens
begin
to
appear
simultaneously
males
or
drones
are
produced
mostly
from
the
unfertilized
eggs
of
workers
although
a
few
may
be
produced
by
the
queen
the
young
queens
and
drones
leave
the
nest
and
mate
and
after
a
short
period
of
freedom
the
fertilized
young
queens
will
begin
to
dig
in
for
the
winter
it
is
an
amazing
fact
that
in
some
species
this
will
happen
while
the
summer
is
still
in
full
swing
for
instance
in
august
the
temperature
then
is
still
very
high
at
the
old
nest
the
queen
will
in
the
early
fall
cease
to
lay
the
fertilized
eggs
that
will
produce
females
as
a
result
the
proportion
of
males
which
leave
the
nest
increases
and
eventually
the
old
colony
will
die
out
completely
the
nest
itself
the
structure
that
in
some
cases
housed
about
individuals
when
the
season
was
at
its
peak
is
now
rapidly
destroyed
by
the
scavenging
larvae
of
certain
beetles
and
moths
not
always
though
does
the
development
of
a
bumblebee
colony
take
place
in
the
smooth
fashion
we
have
just
described
some
members
of
the
bee
family
have
become
idlers
social
parasites
that
live
at
the
expense
of
their
hardworking
relatives
bumblebees
can
thus
suffer
severely
from
the
onslaughts
of
psithyrus
the
cuckoo
bumblebee
as
it
is
called
in
some
european
countries
female
individuals
of
psithyrus
look
deceptively
like
the
workers
and
queens
of
the
bumblebees
they
victimize
the
one
sure
way
to
tell
victim
and
villain
apart
is
to
examine
the
hind
legs
which
in
the
case
of
the
idler
psithyrus
lack
the
pollen
baskets
naturally
the
female
parasite
spends
much
time
in
her
efforts
to
find
a
nest
of
her
host
when
she
succeeds
she
usually
manages
to
slip
in
unobtrusively
to
deposit
an
egg
on
a
completed
loaf
of
beebread
before
the
bumblebees
seal
the
egg
compartment
the
hosts
never
seem
to
recognize
that
something
is
amiss
so
that
the
compartment
afterward
is
sealed
normally
thus
the
larvae
of
the
intruder
can
develop
at
the
expense
of
the
rightful
inhabitants
and
the
store
of
beebread
later
on
they
and
the
mother
psithyrus
are
fed
by
the
bombus
workers
worse
still
in
a
number
of
cases
it
has
been
claimed
that
the
psithyrus
female
kills
off
the
bombus
queen
but
let
us
return
after
this
gruesome
interlude
to
our
willow
catkins
in
the
spring
there
are
other
wild
bees
that
command
our
attention
it
is
almost
certain
that
some
of
these
usually
a
trifle
smaller
than
the
honeybees
are
andrenas
or
mining
bees
there
are
about
different
kinds
of
andrena
in
europe
alone
one
of
my
favorites
is
a
armata
a
species
very
common
in
england
where
it
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
lawn
bee
the
females
like
to
burrow
in
the
short
turf
of
well
kept
lawns
where
their
little
mounds
of
earth
often
appear
by
the
hundreds
almost
equal
in
size
to
a
honeybee
a
armata
is
much
more
beautiful
in
color
at
least
in
the
female
of
the
species
a
rich
velvety
rusty
red
the
males
are
much
duller
after
having
mated
an
andrena
female
digs
a
hole
straight
down
into
the
ground
forming
a
burrow
about
the
size
of
a
lead
pencil
the
bottom
part
of
a
burrow
has
a
number
of
side
tunnels
or
cells
each
of
which
is
provided
with
an
egg
plus
a
store
of
beebread
the
development
of
the
andrena
larvae
is
very
rapid
so
that
by
the
end
of
spring
they
have
already
pupated
and
become
adults
but
they
are
still
enclosed
in
their
larval
cells
and
remain
there
throughout
the
summer
fall
and
winter
their
appearance
next
spring
coincides
in
an
almost
uncanny
way
with
the
flowering
of
their
host
plants
in
the
sacramento
valley
in
california
for
instance
it
has
been
observed
that
there
was
not
one
day
s
difference
between
the
emergence
of
the
andrenas
and
the
opening
of
the
willow
catkins
this
must
be
due
to
a
completely
identical
response
to
the
weather
in
the
plant
and
the
animal
after
the
male
and
female
andrenas
have
mated
the
cycle
is
repeated
although
andrena
is
gregarious
so
that
we
may
find
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
burrows
together
we
must
still
call
it
a
solitary
bee
its
life
history
is
much
simpler
than
that
of
the
truly
colonial
bumblebees
and
can
serve
as
an
example
of
the
life
cycle
of
many
other
species
after
all
social
life
in
the
group
of
the
bees
is
by
no
means
general
although
it
certainly
is
a
striking
feature
on
the
basis
of
its
life
history
we
like
to
think
that
andrena
is
more
primitive
than
the
bumblebees
the
way
in
which
it
transports
its
pollen
is
not
so
perfect
either
it
lacks
pollen
baskets
and
possesses
only
a
large
number
of
long
branched
hairs
on
its
legs
on
which
the
pollen
grains
will
collect
still
andrena
will
do
a
reasonably
good
job
so
that
an
animal
with
a
full
pollen
load
looks
like
a
gay
little
piece
of
yellow
down
floating
in
the
wind
closely
related
to
the
andrenas
are
the
nomias
or
alkali
bees
nomia
melanderi
can
be
found
in
tremendous
numbers
in
certain
parts
of
the
united
states
west
of
the
great
plains
for
example
in
utah
and
central
washington
in
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture
s
yearbook
of
agriculture
which
is
devoted
entirely
to
insects
george
e
bohart
mentions
a
site
in
utah
which
was
estimated
to
contain
nesting
females
often
the
burrows
are
only
an
inch
or
two
apart
and
the
bee
cities
cover
several
acres
the
life
history
of
the
alkali
bee
is
similar
to
that
of
andrena
but
the
first
activity
of
the
adults
does
not
take
place
until
summer
and
the
individuals
hibernate
in
the
prepupal
stage
in
most
places
there
are
two
generations
a
year
a
second
brood
of
adults
appearing
late
in
the
summer
i
must
plead
guilty
to
a
special
sympathy
for
nomias
this
may
just
be
pride
in
my
adopted
state
of
washington
but
certainly
i
love
to
visit
their
mound
cities
near
yakima
and
prosser
in
july
or
august
when
the
bees
are
in
their
most
active
period
the
name
alkali
bee
indicates
that
one
has
to
look
for
them
in
rather
inhospitable
places
sometimes
although
by
no
means
always
these
are
indeed
alkaline
the
thing
is
that
these
bees
love
a
fine
grained
soil
that
is
moist
yet
the
water
in
the
ground
should
not
be
stagnant
either
they
dislike
dense
vegetation
where
does
one
find
such
conditions
the
best
chance
of
course
is
offered
by
gently
sloping
terrain
where
the
water
remains
close
to
the
surface
and
where
the
air
is
dry
so
that
a
high
evaporation
leaves
salty
deposits
which
permit
only
sparse
plant
growth
the
bronchus
and
pulmonary
artery
in
this
lung
type
maintain
a
close
relationship
throughout
the
pulmonary
vein
however
without
the
limiting
supportive
tissue
septa
as
in
type
i
follows
a
more
direct
path
to
the
hilum
and
does
not
maintain
this
close
relationship
figs
another
marked
difference
is
noted
here
the
pulmonary
artery
in
addition
to
supplying
the
distal
portion
of
the
respiratory
bronchiole
the
alveolar
duct
and
the
alveoli
continues
on
and
directly
supplies
the
thin
pleura
fig
the
bronchial
artery
except
for
a
small
number
of
short
branches
in
the
hilum
contributes
none
of
the
pleural
blood
supply
it
does
as
in
type
i
supply
the
hilar
lymph
nodes
the
pulmonary
artery
the
pulmonary
vein
the
bronchi
and
the
bronchioles
terminating
in
a
common
capillary
bed
with
the
pulmonary
artery
at
the
level
of
the
respiratory
bronchiole
no
bronchial
artery
pulmonary
artery
anastomoses
were
noted
in
this
group
lung
type
iii
fig
is
to
some
degree
a
composite
of
types
i
and
ii
it
is
characterized
by
the
presence
of
incompletely
developed
secondary
lobules
well
defined
but
haphazardly
arranged
interlobular
septa
and
a
thick
remarkably
vascular
pleura
fig
the
most
distal
airways
are
similar
to
those
found
in
type
i
being
composed
of
numerous
apparently
true
terminal
bronchioles
and
occasional
poorly
developed
respiratory
bronchioles
figs
in
this
instance
because
of
incomplete
septation
the
secondary
lobule
does
not
constitute
in
itself
what
appears
to
be
a
small
individual
lung
as
in
type
i
air
drifts
from
one
area
to
another
are
therefore
conceivable
distally
the
bronchus
is
situated
between
a
pulmonary
artery
on
one
side
and
a
pulmonary
vein
on
the
other
as
in
type
i
fig
this
relationship
however
is
not
maintained
centrally
here
the
pulmonary
vein
as
in
type
ii
is
noted
to
draw
away
from
the
bronchus
and
to
follow
a
more
direct
independent
course
to
the
hilum
figs
the
bronchial
artery
in
its
course
and
distribution
differs
somewhat
from
that
found
in
other
mammals
as
seen
in
types
i
and
ii
it
supplies
the
hilar
lymph
nodes
vasa
vasorum
to
the
pulmonary
artery
and
vein
the
bronchi
and
the
terminal
bronchioles
as
in
type
i
it
provides
arterial
blood
to
the
interlobular
septa
and
an
extremely
rich
anastomotic
pleural
supply
is
seen
figs
this
pleural
supply
is
derived
both
from
hilar
and
interlobular
bronchial
artery
branches
such
a
dual
derivation
was
strikingly
demonstrated
during
the
injection
process
where
initial
filling
would
be
noted
to
occur
in
several
isolated
pleural
vessels
at
once
some
of
these
were
obviously
filling
from
interlobular
branches
of
the
bronchial
arteries
while
others
were
filling
from
direct
hilar
branches
following
along
the
pleural
surface
with
completion
of
filling
net
like
anastomoses
were
noted
to
be
present
between
these
separately
derived
branches
an
unusual
increase
in
the
number
of
bronchial
arteries
present
within
the
substance
of
the
lung
was
noted
this
was
accounted
for
primarily
by
the
presence
of
a
bronchial
artery
closely
following
the
pulmonary
artery
the
diameter
of
this
bronchial
artery
was
much
too
large
for
it
to
be
a
mere
vasa
vasorum
figs
in
distal
regions
its
diameter
would
be
one
fourth
to
one
fifth
that
of
the
pulmonary
artery
this
vessel
could
be
followed
to
the
parenchyma
where
it
directly
provided
bronchial
arterial
blood
to
the
alveolar
capillary
bed
figs
also
three
other
direct
pathways
of
alveolar
bronchial
arterial
supply
were
noted
via
the
pleura
through
the
interlobular
septa
and
along
the
terminal
bronchiole
figs
one
bronchial
arteriolar
pulmonary
arteriolar
anastomosis
was
noted
at
the
terminal
bronchiolar
level
fig
discussion
it
is
evident
that
many
marked
and
striking
differences
exist
between
lungs
when
an
inter
species
comparison
is
made
the
significance
of
these
differences
has
not
been
studied
nor
has
the
existence
of
corresponding
physiologic
differences
been
determined
however
the
dynamics
of
airflow
from
morphologic
considerations
alone
may
conceivably
be
different
in
the
monkey
than
in
the
horse
the
volume
and
perhaps
even
the
characteristics
of
bronchial
arterial
blood
flow
might
be
different
in
the
dog
than
in
the
horse
also
interlobular
air
drifts
may
be
all
but
nonexistent
in
the
cow
probably
occur
in
the
horse
much
as
in
the
human
being
and
in
contrast
are
present
to
a
relatively
immense
degree
on
a
segmental
basis
in
the
dog
where
lobules
are
absent
van
allen
and
lindskog
a
reason
for
such
wide
variation
in
the
pulmonary
morphology
is
entirely
lacking
at
present
within
certain
wide
limits
anatomy
dictates
function
and
if
one
is
permitted
to
speculate
potential
pathology
should
be
included
in
this
statement
as
well
for
example
the
marked
susceptibility
of
the
monkey
to
respiratory
infection
might
be
related
to
its
delicate
long
alveolar
ducts
and
short
large
bronchioles
situated
within
a
parenchyma
entirely
lacking
in
protective
supportive
tissue
barriers
such
as
those
found
in
types
i
and
iii
one
might
also
wonder
if
monkeys
are
capable
of
developing
bronchiolitis
as
we
know
it
in
man
or
the
horse
in
addition
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
chronic
generalized
emphysema
occurring
in
a
cow
considering
its
marked
lobular
development
but
conversely
not
difficult
to
imagine
this
occurring
in
the
horse
or
the
dog
anatomically
the
horse
lung
appears
to
be
remarkably
like
that
of
man
insofar
as
this
can
be
ascertained
from
comparison
of
our
findings
in
the
horse
with
those
of
others
birnbaum
in
the
human
being
the
only
area
in
which
one
might
find
major
disagreement
in
this
matter
is
in
regard
to
the
alveolar
distribution
of
the
bronchial
arteries
as
early
as
le
fort
claimed
an
alveolar
distribution
of
the
bronchial
arteries
in
human
beings
in
this
was
reaffirmed
by
cudkowicz
the
opposition
to
this
point
of
view
has
its
staunchest
support
in
the
work
of
miller
apparently
however
miller
has
relied
heavily
on
the
anatomy
in
dogs
and
cats
and
he
has
been
criticized
for
using
pathologic
human
material
in
his
normal
study
loosli
although
miller
noted
in
that
a
difference
in
the
pleural
blood
supply
existed
between
animals
nowhere
in
his
published
works
is
it
found
that
he
did
a
comparative
study
of
the
intrapulmonary
features
of
various
mammalian
lungs
other
than
in
the
dog
and
cat
miller
the
meaning
of
this
variation
in
distribution
of
the
bronchial
artery
as
found
in
the
horse
is
not
clear
however
this
artery
is
known
to
be
a
nutrient
vessel
with
a
distribution
primarily
to
the
proximal
airways
and
supportive
tissues
of
the
lung
the
alveoli
and
respiratory
bronchioles
are
primarily
diffusing
tissues
theoretically
they
are
capable
of
extracting
their
required
oxygen
either
from
the
surrounding
air
ghoreyeb
and
karsner
or
from
pulmonary
arterial
blood
comroe
therefore
an
explanation
of
this
alveolar
bronchial
artery
supply
might
be
the
nutritive
requirement
of
an
increased
amount
of
supportive
tissue
not
primarily
diffusing
in
nature
in
the
region
of
the
alveolus
if
this
be
true
the
possibility
exists
that
an
occlusive
lesion
of
the
bronchial
arteries
might
cause
widespread
degeneration
of
supportive
tissue
similar
to
that
seen
in
generalized
emphysema
one
would
not
expect
such
an
event
to
occur
in
animals
possessing
lungs
of
types
i
or
ii
the
presence
of
normally
occurring
bronchial
artery
pulmonary
artery
anastomoses
was
first
noted
in
by
ruysch
and
thereafter
by
many
others
nakamura
verloop
marchand
gilroy
and
watson
von
hayek
and
tobin
have
all
claimed
their
normal
but
relatively
nonfunctional
existence
in
the
human
being
miller
is
the
principal
antagonist
of
this
viewpoint
in
criticism
of
the
latter
s
views
his
conclusions
were
based
upon
dog
lung
injection
studies
in
which
all
of
the
vascular
channels
were
first
filled
with
a
solution
under
pressure
and
then
were
injected
with
various
sized
colored
particles
designed
to
stop
at
the
arteriolar
level
as
early
as
ghoreyeb
and
karsner
demonstrated
with
perfusion
studies
in
dogs
that
bronchial
artery
flow
would
remain
constant
at
a
certain
low
level
when
pressure
was
maintained
in
the
pulmonary
artery
and
vein
but
that
increases
in
bronchial
artery
flow
would
occur
in
response
to
a
relative
drop
in
pulmonary
artery
pressure
berry
brailsford
and
daly
in
and
nakamura
in
reaffirmed
this
our
own
studies
in
which
bronchial
artery
pulmonary
artery
anastomoses
were
demonstrated
were
accomplished
by
injecting
the
bronchial
artery
first
with
no
pressure
on
the
pulmonary
artery
or
vein
and
then
by
injecting
the
pulmonary
artery
and
vein
afterwards
it
is
distinctly
possible
therefore
that
simultaneous
pressures
in
all
three
vessels
would
have
rendered
the
shunts
inoperable
and
hence
uninjectable
this
viewpoint
is
further
supported
by
verloop
s
demonstration
of
thickened
bronchial
artery
and
arteriolar
muscular
coats
which
are
capable
of
acting
as
valves
in
other
words
the
anastomoses
between
the
bronchial
artery
and
pulmonary
artery
should
be
considered
as
functional
or
demand
shunts
in
addition
little
work
has
been
done
on
a
comparative
basis
in
regard
to
the
normal
existence
of
bronchial
artery
pulmonary
artery
anastomoses
verloop
found
these
shunts
in
the
human
being
but
was
unable
to
find
them
in
rats
ellis
grindlay
and
edwards
also
were
unable
to
find
them
in
rats
nakamura
was
unable
to
demonstrate
their
existence
either
by
anatomic
or
physiologic
methods
in
dogs
the
possibility
that
the
absence
or
presence
of
these
shunts
is
species
dependent
is
therefore
inferred
certainly
the
mere
fact
of
failing
to
demonstrate
them
in
one
or
another
species
does
not
conclusively
deny
their
existence
in
that
species
it
is
however
highly
suggestive
and
agrees
well
with
our
own
findings
in
which
we
also
failed
to
demonstrate
normally
occurring
bronchial
artery
pulmonary
artery
shunts
in
certain
species
especially
the
dog
in
conclusion
these
findings
suggest
the
need
for
a
comparative
physiology
pathology
and
histology
of
mammalian
lungs
in
addition
a
detailed
interspecies
survey
of
the
incidence
of
generalized
pulmonary
emphysema
in
mammals
would
be
interesting
and
pertinent
also
for
the
present
great
caution
should
be
exercised
in
the
choice
of
an
experimental
animal
for
pulmonary
studies
if
they
are
to
be
applied
to
man
this
is
especially
so
if
the
dog
cat
or
monkey
are
to
be
used
in
view
of
their
marked
anatomical
differences
from
man
finally
it
is
suggested
that
in
many
respects
the
horse
lung
may
be
anatomically
more
comparable
to
that
of
the
human
than
any
other
presently
known
species
summary
the
main
subgross
anatomical
features
of
the
lungs
of
various
mammals
are
presented
a
tabulation
of
these
features
permits
the
lungs
to
be
grouped
into
three
distinctive
subgross
types
type
i
is
represented
by
the
cow
sheep
and
pig
type
ii
by
the
dog
cat
and
monkey
type
iii
by
the
horse
lobularity
is
extremely
well
developed
in
type
i
absent
in
type
ii
imperfectly
developed
in
type
iii
the
pleura
and
interlobular
septa
are
thick
in
types
i
and
iii
the
pleura
is
extremely
thin
in
type
ii
and
septa
are
absent
arterial
supply
to
the
pleura
in
types
i
and
iii
is
provided
by
the
bronchial
artery
and
in
type
ii
by
the
pulmonary
artery
in
types
i
ii
and
iii
the
bronchial
artery
terminates
in
a
capillary
bed
shared
in
common
with
the
pulmonary
artery
at
the
level
of
the
distal
bronchiole
in
type
iii
the
bronchial
artery
also
provides
blood
directly
to
the
alveolar
capillary
bed
true
terminal
bronchioles
comprise
the
most
frequent
form
taken
by
the
distal
airways
in
types
i
and
iii
although
small
numbers
of
poorly
developed
respiratory
bronchioles
are
present
well
developed
respiratory
bronchioles
on
the
other
hand
appear
to
be
the
only
form
taken
by
the
distal
airways
in
type
ii
in
type
i
the
pulmonary
vein
closely
follows
the
course
of
the
bronchus
and
the
pulmonary
artery
from
the
periphery
to
the
hilum
this
may
be
due
to
the
heavy
interlobular
connective
tissue
barriers
present
in
type
iii
this
general
relationship
is
maintained
peripherally
but
not
centrally
where
the
pulmonary
vein
follows
a
more
independent
path
to
the
hilum
as
is
the
case
throughout
the
lung
in
type
ii
since
emotional
reactions
in
the
higher
vertebrates
depend
on
individual
experience
and
are
aroused
in
man
in
addition
by
complex
symbols
one
would
expect
that
the
hypothalamus
could
be
excited
from
the
cortex
in
experiments
with
topical
application
of
strychnine
on
the
cerebral
cortex
the
transmission
of
impulses
from
the
cortex
to
the
hypothalamus
was
demonstrated
moreover
the
responsiveness
of
the
hypothalamus
to
nociceptive
stimulation
is
greatly
increased
under
these
conditions
even
more
complex
and
obviously
cortically
induced
forms
of
emotional
arousal
could
be
elicited
in
monkey
a
on
seeing
monkey
b
but
not
a
rabbit
in
emotional
stress
a
previously
extinguished
conditioned
reaction
was
restored
in
monkey
a
and
was
associated
with
typical
signs
of
emotional
excitement
including
sympathetic
discharges
it
seems
to
follow
that
by
and
large
an
antagonism
exists
between
the
paleo
and
the
neocortex
as
far
as
emotional
reactivity
is
concerned
and
that
the
balance
between
the
two
systems
determines
the
emotional
responsiveness
of
the
organism
in
addition
the
neocortical
hypothalamic
relations
play
a
great
role
in
primates
as
mirsky
s
interesting
experiment
on
the
communication
of
affect
demonstrates
but
even
in
relatively
primitive
laboratory
animals
such
as
the
rat
sex
activity
closely
identified
with
the
hypothalamus
and
the
visceral
brain
is
enhanced
by
the
neocortex
maclean
stressed
correctly
the
importance
of
the
visceral
brain
for
preservation
of
the
individual
and
the
species
as
evidenced
by
the
influence
of
the
limbic
brain
including
the
hypothalamus
on
emotions
related
to
fight
and
flight
and
also
on
sexual
functions
it
should
be
added
that
in
man
neocortical
hypothalamic
interrelations
probably
play
a
role
in
the
fusion
of
emotional
processes
with
those
underlying
perception
memory
imagination
and
creativity
previous
experiences
are
obviously
of
great
importance
for
the
qualitative
and
quantitative
emotional
response
the
visceral
brain
as
well
as
the
neocortex
is
known
to
contribute
to
memory
but
this
topic
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
paper
xiii
hypothalamic
balance
and
its
significance
after
this
brief
discussion
of
neo
paleocortical
and
cortico
hypothalamic
relations
let
us
return
once
more
to
the
problem
of
hypothalamic
balance
and
its
physiological
and
pathological
significance
facilitatory
processes
take
place
between
neocortex
and
hypothalamus
via
ascending
and
descending
pathways
thus
cortico
fugal
discharges
induced
by
topical
application
of
strychnine
to
a
minute
area
in
the
neocortex
summate
with
spikes
present
in
the
hypothalamus
and
cause
increased
convulsive
discharges
on
the
other
hand
the
temporary
reduction
in
hypothalamic
excitability
through
the
injection
of
a
barbiturate
into
the
posterior
hypothalamus
causes
a
lessening
in
frequency
and
amplitude
of
cortical
strychnine
spikes
until
the
hypothalamic
excitability
is
restored
apparently
a
positive
feedback
exists
between
the
posterior
hypothalamus
and
the
cerebral
cortex
consequently
if
for
any
reason
the
hypothalamic
excitability
falls
below
the
physiological
level
the
lessened
hypothalamic
cortical
discharges
lead
to
a
diminished
state
of
activity
in
the
cortex
with
consequent
reduction
in
the
cortico
fugal
discharges
obviously
a
vicious
cycle
develops
this
tendency
can
be
broken
either
by
restoring
hypothalamic
excitability
directly
or
via
cortico
hypothalamic
pathways
it
is
believed
that
drug
therapy
and
electroshock
involve
the
former
and
psychotherapy
the
latter
mechanism
before
we
comment
further
on
these
pathological
conditions
we
should
remember
that
changes
in
the
state
of
the
hypothalamus
within
physiological
limits
distinguish
sleep
from
wakefulness
thus
a
low
intensity
of
hypothalamic
cortical
discharges
prevails
in
sleep
and
a
high
one
during
wakefulness
resulting
in
synchronous
eeg
potentials
in
the
former
and
asynchrony
in
the
latter
condition
moreover
the
dominance
in
parasympathetic
action
with
reciprocal
inhibition
of
the
sympathetic
at
the
hypothalamic
level
induces
by
its
peripheral
action
the
autonomic
symptoms
of
sleep
and
by
its
action
on
the
cortex
a
lessening
in
the
reactivity
of
the
sensory
and
motor
apparatus
of
the
somatic
nervous
system
with
the
dominance
of
the
sympathetic
division
of
the
hypothalamus
the
opposite
changes
occur
since
electrical
stimulation
of
the
posterior
hypothalamus
produces
the
effects
of
wakefulness
while
stimulation
of
the
anterior
hypothalamus
induces
sleep
it
may
be
said
that
the
reactivity
of
the
whole
organism
is
altered
by
a
change
in
the
autonomic
reactivity
of
the
hypothalamus
similar
effects
can
be
induced
reflexly
via
the
baroreceptor
reflexes
in
man
and
animals
of
particular
importance
is
the
study
of
the
actions
of
drugs
in
this
respect
although
no
drugs
act
exclusively
on
the
hypothalamus
or
a
part
of
it
there
is
sufficient
specificity
to
distinguish
drugs
which
shift
the
hypothalamic
balance
to
the
sympathetic
side
from
those
which
produce
a
parasympathetic
dominance
the
former
comprise
analeptic
and
psychoactive
drugs
the
latter
the
tranquilizers
specific
differences
exist
in
the
action
of
different
drugs
belonging
to
the
same
group
as
for
instance
between
reserpine
and
chlorpromazine
important
as
these
differences
are
they
should
not
obscure
the
basic
fact
that
by
shifting
the
hypothalamic
balance
sufficiently
to
the
parasympathetic
side
we
produce
depressions
whereas
a
shift
in
the
opposite
direction
causes
excitatory
effects
and
eventually
maniclike
changes
the
emotional
states
produced
by
drugs
influence
the
cortical
potentials
in
a
characteristic
manner
synchrony
prevails
in
the
eeg
of
the
experimental
animal
after
administration
of
tranquilizers
but
asynchrony
after
application
of
analeptic
and
psychoactive
drugs
the
shock
therapies
act
likewise
on
the
hypothalamic
balance
physiological
experiments
and
clinical
observations
have
shown
that
these
procedures
influence
the
hypothalamically
controlled
hypophyseal
secretions
and
increase
sympathetic
discharges
they
shift
the
hypothalamic
balance
to
the
sympathetic
side
this
explains
the
beneficial
effect
of
electroshock
therapy
in
certain
depressions
and
a
shift
in
the
reaction
from
hypo
to
normal
reactivity
of
the
sympathetic
system
as
shown
by
the
mecholyl
test
some
investigators
have
found
a
parallelism
between
remissions
and
return
of
the
sympathetic
reactivity
of
the
hypothalamus
to
the
normal
level
as
indicated
by
the
mecholyl
test
and
conversely
between
clinical
impairment
and
increasing
deviation
of
this
test
from
the
norm
nevertheless
the
theory
that
the
determining
influence
of
the
hypothalamic
balance
has
a
profound
influence
on
the
clinical
behavior
of
neuropsychiatric
patients
has
not
yet
been
tested
on
an
adequate
number
of
patients
the
mecholyl
and
noradrenalin
tests
applied
with
certain
precautions
are
reliable
indicators
of
this
central
autonomic
balance
but
for
the
sake
of
correlating
autonomic
and
clinical
states
and
of
studying
the
effect
of
certain
therapeutic
procedures
on
central
autonomic
reactions
additional
tests
seem
to
be
desirable
it
was
assumed
that
the
shift
in
autonomic
hypothalamic
balance
occurring
spontaneously
in
neuropsychiatric
patients
from
the
application
of
certain
therapeutic
procedures
follows
the
pattern
known
from
the
sleep
wakefulness
cycle
a
change
in
the
balance
to
the
parasympathetic
side
leads
in
the
normal
individual
to
sleep
or
in
special
circumstances
to
cardiovascular
collapse
or
nausea
and
vomiting
in
both
conditions
the
emotional
and
perceptual
sensitivity
is
diminished
but
no
depression
occurs
such
as
is
seen
clinically
or
may
be
produced
in
normal
persons
by
drugs
the
fundamental
differences
between
physiological
and
pathological
states
of
parasympathetic
and
also
of
sympathetic
dominance
remain
to
be
elucidated
perhaps
a
clue
to
these
and
related
problems
lies
in
the
fact
that
changes
in
the
intensity
of
hypothalamic
discharges
which
are
associated
with
changes
in
its
balance
lead
also
to
qualitative
alterations
in
reactivity
a
state
of
parasympathetic
tuning
of
the
hypothalamus
induced
experimentally
causes
not
only
an
increase
in
the
parsympathetic
reactivity
of
this
structure
to
direct
and
reflexly
induced
stimuli
but
leads
also
to
an
autonomic
reversal
a
stimulus
acting
sympathetically
under
control
conditions
elicits
in
this
state
of
tuning
a
parasympathetic
response
furthermore
conditioned
reactions
are
fundamentally
altered
when
the
hypothalamic
sympathetic
reactivity
is
augmented
beyond
a
critical
level
and
several
types
of
behavioral
changes
probably
related
to
the
degree
of
central
autonomic
tuning
are
observed
if
for
instance
such
a
change
is

it

that

is

with

these
are

and

they
illustrate
the

fact
that
fundamental
alterations
in
conditioned

occur
in

variety
of
states
in
which
the

has
been
altered

action
or
clinical
processes
xiv
on
the
physiological
basis
of
some
form
of
psychotherapy
the
foregoing
remarks
imply
that
the
hypothalamic
balance
plays
a
crucial
role
at
the
crossroads
between
physiological
and
pathological
forms
of
emotion
if
this
is
the
case
one
would
expect
that
not
only
the
various
procedures
just
mentioned
which
alter
the
hypothalamic
balance
would
influence
emotional
state
and
behavior
but
that
emotion
itself
would
act
likewise
we
pointed
out
that
emotional
excitement
may
lead
to
psychosomatic
disorders
and
neurotic
symptoms
particularly
in
certain
types
of
personality
but
it
is
also
known
that
the
reliving
of
a
strong
emotion
abreaction
may
cure
a
battle
neurosis
this
phenomenon
raises
the
question
whether
the
guidance
of
the
emotions
for
therapeutic
ends
may
not
have
an
even
wider
application
in
the
area
of
the
neuroses
being
a
strictly
physiological
procedure
one
may
expect
from
such
a
study
additional
information
on
the
nature
of
the
emotional
process
itself
wolpe
s
experiments
and
therapeutic
work
lie
in
this
area
he
showed
convincingly
that
anxiety
is
a
learned
conditioned
reaction
and
is
the
basis
of
experimental
and
clinical
neuroses
and
assumed
therefore
that
the
neuronal
changes
which
underlie
the
neuroses
are
functional
and
reversible
an
important
observation
of
pavlov
served
as
a
guide
post
to
achieve
such
a
reversibility
by
physiological
means
in
a
conditioning
experiment
he
demonstrated
the
antagonism
between
feeding
and
pain
a
mild
electrical
shock
served
as
a
conditioned
stimulus
and
was
followed
by
feeding
the
pain
became
thus
the
symbol
for
food
and
elicited
salivary
secretion
conditioned
reflex
even
when
the
intensity
of
the
shocks
was
increased
gradually
it
failed
to
evoke
any
signs
of
pain
since
strong
nociceptive
stimuli
produce
an
experimental
neurosis
during
which
the
animals
fail
to
eat
in
the
experimental
situation
wolpe
thought
that
he
could
utilize
the
feeding
pain
antagonism
to
inhibit
the
neurotic
symptoms
through
feeding
appropriate
experiments
showed
that
this
is
indeed
possible
he
then
applied
this
principle
of
reciprocal
inhibition
to
human
neuroses
he
took
advantage
of
the
antagonism
between
aggressive
assertiveness
and
anxiety
and
found
a
relatively
rapid
disappearance
of
anxiety
when
the
former
attitude
was
established
for
the
interpretation
of
these
significant
investigations
it
should
be
remembered
that
reciprocal
relations
exist
in
the
hypothalamus
with
respect
to
autonomic
and
somatic
functions
which
are
closely
associated
with
the
emotions
the
feeding
pain
antagonism
seems
to
be
based
on
this
reciprocal
relation
between
the
tropho
and
ergotropic
systems
furthermore
a
functional
antagonism
exists
between
an
aggressive
attitude
and
a
state
of
anxiety
although
in
both
emotions
sympathetic
symptoms
are
present
different
autonomic
somatic
patterns
underlie
aggression
and
anxiety
respectively
as
indicated
by
the
rate
of
the
excretion
of
the
catecholamines
the
state
of
the
muscle
tone
and
the
mecholyl
test
the
psychological
incompatibility
of
these
emotional
states
seems
to
be
reflected
in
or
based
on
this
marked
difference
xv
concluding
remarks
in
our
attempt
to
interpret
the
emotions
in
their
physiological
and
pathological
range
we
emphasized
the
importance
of
the
degree
of
activity
of
the
parasympathetic
and
sympathetic
divisions
of
the
hypothalamic
system
and
their
influence
on
the
inhibitory
and
excitatory
systems
respectively
we
stressed
the
reciprocal
relation
of
these
systems
with
respect
to
the
autonomic
somatic
downward
discharge
as
well
as
regarding
the
hypothalamic
cortical
discharge
although
we
are
still
far
from
a
complete
understanding
of
these
problems
as
a
first
approximation
it
is
suggested
that
alterations
in
the
hypothalamic
balance
with
consequent
changes
in
the
hypothalamic
cortical
discharges
account
for
major
changes
in
behavior
seen
in
various
moods
and
states
of
emotions
in
man
and
beast
under
physiological
circumstances
in
experimental
and
clinical
neurosis
and
as
the
result
of
psychopharmacological
agents
in
view
of
the
important
role
which
emotional
disturbances
play
in
the
genesis
of
neurotic
and
psychotic
disorders
and
the
parallelism
observed
between
autonomic
states
and
psychological
behavior
in
several
instances
it
is
further
suggested
that
a
hypothalamic
imbalance
may
play
an
important
role
in
initiating
mental
changes
introduction
in
we
investigate
a
new
series
of
line
involutions
in
a
projective
space
of
three
dimensions
over
the
field
of
complex
numbers
these
are
defined
by
a
simple
involutorial
transformation
of
the
points
in
which
a
general
line
meets
a
nonsingular
quadric
surface
bearing
a
curve
of
symbol
then
in
we
show
that
any
line
involution
with
the
properties
that
a
it
has
no
complex
of
invariant
lines
and
b
its
singular
lines
form
a
complex
consisting
exclusively
of
the
lines
which
meet
a
twisted
curve
is
necessarily
of
the
type
discussed
in
no
generalization
of
these
results
to
spaces
of
more
than
three
dimensions
has
so
far
been
found
possible
let
q
be
a
nonsingular
quadric
surface
bearing
reguli
and
and
let
g
be
a
curve
of
order
k
on
q
a
general
line
l
meets
q
in
two
points
and
through
each
of
which
passes
a
unique
generator
of
the
regulus
whose
lines
are
simple
secants
of
g
on
these
generators
let
and
be
respectively
the
harmonic
conjugates
of
and
with
respect
to
the
two
points
in
which
the
corresponding
generator
meets
g
the
line
is
the
image
of
l
clearly
the
transformation
is
involutorial
we
observe
first
that
no
line
l
can
meet
its
image
except
at
one
of
its
intersections
with
q
for
if
it
did
the
plane
of
l
and
l
would
contain
two
generators
of
which
is
impossible
moreover
from
the
definitive
transformation
of
intercepts
on
the
generators
of
it
is
clear
that
the
only
points
of
q
at
which
a
line
can
meets
its
image
are
the
points
of
g
hence
the
totality
of
singular
lines
is
the
k
th
order
complex
of
lines
which
meet
g
the
invariant
lines
are
the
lines
of
the
congruence
of
secants
of
g
since
each
of
these
meets
q
in
two
points
which
are
invariant
the
order
of
this
congruence
is
since
secants
of
a
curve
of
symbol
a
b
on
a
quadric
surface
pass
through
an
arbitrary
point
the
class
of
the
congruence
is
since
an
arbitrary
plane
meets
g
in
k
points
since
the
complex
of
singular
lines
is
of
order
k
and
since
there
is
no
complex
of
invariant
lines
it
follows
from
the
formula
that
the
order
of
the
involution
is
there
are
various
sets
of
exceptional
lines
or
lines
whose
images
are
not
unique
the
most
obvious
of
these
is
the
quadratic
complex
of
tangents
to
q
each
line
of
which
is
transformed
into
the
entire
pencil
of
lines
tangent
to
q
at
the
image
of
the
point
of
tangency
of
the
given
line
thus
pencils
of
tangents
to
q
are
transformed
into
pencils
of
tangents
it
is
interesting
that
a
correspondence
can
be
established
between
the
lines
of
two
such
pencils
so
that
in
a
sense
a
unique
image
can
actually
be
assigned
to
each
tangent
for
the
lines
of
any
plane
meeting
q
in
a
conic
c
are
transformed
into
the
congruence
of
secants
of
the
curve
c
into
which
c
is
transformed
in
the
point
involution
on
q
in
particular
tangents
to
c
are
transformed
into
tangents
to
c
moreover
if
and
are
two
planes
intersecting
in
a
line
l
tangent
to
q
at
a
point
p
the
two
free
intersections
of
the
image
curves
and
must
coincide
at
p
the
image
of
p
and
at
this
point
and
must
have
a
common
tangent
l
hence
thought
of
as
a
line
in
a
particular
plane
any
tangent
to
q
has
a
unique
image
and
moreover
this
image
is
the
same
for
all
planes
through
l
each
generator
of
is
also
exceptional
for
each
is
transformed
into
the
entire
congruence
of
secants
of
the
curve
into
which
that
generator
is
transformed
by
the
point
involution
on
q
this
curve
is
of
symbol
since
it
meets
and
hence
every
line
of
in
the
invariant
points
on
and
since
it
obviously
meets
every
line
of
in
a
single
point
the
congruence
of
its
secants
is
therefore
of
order
and
class
a
final
class
of
exceptional
lines
is
identifiable
from
the
following
considerations
since
no
two
generators
of
can
intersect
it
follows
that
their
image
curves
can
have
no
free
intersections
in
other
words
these
curves
have
only
fixed
intersections
common
to
them
all
now
the
only
way
in
which
all
curves
of
the
image
family
of
can
pass
through
a
fixed
point
is
to
have
a
generator
of
which
is
not
a
secant
but
a
tangent
of
g
for
then
any
point
on
such
a
generator
will
be
transformed
into
the
point
of
tangency
since
two
curves
of
symbol
on
q
intersect
in
points
it
follows
that
there
are
lines
of
which
are
tangent
to
g
clearly
any
line
l
of
any
bundle
having
one
of
these
points
of
tangency
t
as
vertex
will
be
transformed
into
the
entire
pencil
having
the
image
of
the
second
intersection
of
l
and
q
as
vertex
and
lying
in
the
plane
determined
by
the
image
point
and
the
generator
of
which
is
tangent
to
g
at
t
a
line
through
two
of
these
points
and
will
be
transformed
into
the
entire
bilinear
congruence
having
the
tangents
to
g
at
and
as
directrices
a
conic
c
being
a
curve
on
q
meets
the
image
of
any
line
of
which
we
have
already
found
to
be
a
curve
on
q
in
points
hence
its
image
c
meets
any
line
of
in
points
moreover
c
obviously
meets
any
line
in
a
single
point
hence
c
is
a
curve
on
q
therefore
the
congruence
of
its
secants
that
is
the
image
of
a
general
plane
field
of
lines
is
of
order
and
class
finally
the
image
of
a
general
bundle
of
lines
is
a
congruence
whose
order
is
the
order
of
the
congruence
of
invariant
lines
namely
and
whose
class
is
the
order
of
the
image
congruence
of
a
general
plane
field
of
lines
namely
the
preceding
observations
make
it
clear
that
there
exist
line
involutions
of
all
orders
greater
than
with
no
complex
of
invariant
lines
and
with
a
complex
of
singular
lines
consisting
exclusively
of
the
lines
which
meet
a
twisted
curve
g
we
now
shall
show
that
any
involution
with
these
characteristics
is
necessarily
of
the
type
we
have
just
described
to
do
this
we
must
first
show
that
every
line
which
meets
g
in
a
point
p
meets
its
image
at
p
to
see
this
consider
a
general
pencil
of
lines
containing
a
general
secant
of
g
by
the
image
of
this
pencil
is
a
ruled
surface
of
order
which
is
met
by
the
plane
of
the
pencil
in
a
curve
c
of
order
on
c
there
is
a
correspondence
in
which
the
points
cut
from
c
by
a
general
line
l
of
the
pencil
correspond
to
the
point
of
intersection
of
the
image
of
l
and
the
plane
of
the
pencil
since
c
is
rational
this
correspondence
has
k
coincidences
each
of
which
implies
a
line
of
the
pencil
which
meets
its
image
however
since
the
pencil
contains
a
secant
of
g
it
actually
contains
only
singular
lines
to
avoid
this
contradiction
it
is
necessary
that
c
be
composite
with
the
secant
of
g
and
a
curve
of
order
as
components
thus
it
follows
that
the
secants
of
g
are
all
invariant
but
if
this
is
the
case
then
an
arbitrary
pencil
of
lines
having
a
point
p
of
g
as
vertex
is
transformed
into
a
ruled
surface
of
order
having
generators
concurrent
at
p
since
a
ruled
surface
of
order
n
with
n
concurrent
generators
is
necessarily
a
cone
it
follows
finally
that
every
line
through
a
point
p
of
g
meets
its
image
at
p
as
asserted
now
consider
the
transformation
of
the
lines
of
a
bundle
with
vertex
p
on
g
which
is
effected
by
the
involution
as
a
whole
from
the
preceding
remarks
it
is
clear
that
such
a
bundle
is
transformed
into
itself
in
an
involutorial
fashion
moreover
in
this
involution
there
is
a
cone
of
invariant
lines
of
order
namely
the
cone
of
secants
of
g
which
pass
through
p
hence
it
follows
that
the
involution
within
the
bundle
must
be
a
perspective
de
jonquieres
involution
of
order
and
the
invariant
locus
must
have
a
multiple
line
of
multiplicity
either
or
the
first
possibility
requires
that
there
be
a
line
through
p
which
meets
g
in
points
the
second
requires
that
there
be
a
line
through
p
which
meets
g
in
points
in
each
case
lines
of
the
bundles
are
transformed
by
involutions
within
the
pencils
they
determine
with
the
multiple
secant
in
the
first
case
the
fixed
elements
within
each
pencil
are
the
multiple
secant
and
the
line
joining
the
vertex
p
to
the
intersection
of
g
and
the
plane
of
the
pencil
which
does
not
lie
on
the
multiple
secant
in
the
second
the
fixed
elements
are
the
lines
which
join
the
vertex
p
to
the
two
intersections
of
g
and
the
plane
of
the
pencil
which
do
not
lie
on
the
multiple
secant
the
multiple
secants
of
course
are
exceptional
and
in
each
case
are
transformed
into
cones
of
order
observations
similar
to
these
can
be
made
at
each
point
of
g
hence
g
must
have
either
a
regulus
of
fold
secants
or
a
regulus
of
fold
secants
moreover
if
no
two
of
the
multiple
secants
can
intersect
for
if
such
were
the
case
either
the
plane
of
the
two
lines
would
meet
g
in
more
than
k
points
or
alternatively
the
order
of
the
image
regulus
of
the
pencil
determined
by
the
two
lines
would
be
too
high
but
if
no
two
lines
of
the
regulus
of
multiple
secants
of
g
can
intersect
then
the
regulus
must
be
quadratic
or
in
other
words
g
must
be
either
a
or
a
curve
on
a
nonsingular
quadric
surface
we
now
observe
that
the
case
in
which
g
is
a
curve
on
a
quadric
is
impossible
if
the
complex
of
singular
lines
consists
exclusively
of
the
lines
which
meet
g
for
any
pencil
in
a
plane
containing
a
fold
secant
of
g
has
an
image
regulus
which
meets
the
plane
of
the
pencil
in
lines
namely
the
images
of
the
lines
of
the
pencil
which
pass
through
the
intersection
of
g
and
the
multiple
secant
plus
an
additional
component
to
account
for
the
intersections
of
the
images
of
the
general
lines
of
the
pencil
however
if
there
is
no
additional
complex
of
singular
lines
the
order
of
the
image
regulus
of
a
pencil
is
precisely
this
contradicts
the
preceding
observations
and
so
under
the
assumption
of
this
paper
we
must
reject
the
possibility
that
g
is
a
curve
on
a
quadric
surface
continuing
with
the
case
in
which
g
is
a
curve
on
a
quadric
q
we
first
observe
that
the
second
regulus
of
q
consists
precisely
of
the
lines
which
join
the
two
free
intersections
of
g
and
the
planes
through
any
one
of
the
multiple
secants
for
each
of
these
lines
meets
q
in
three
points
namely
two
points
on
g
and
one
point
on
one
of
the
multiple
secants
now
consider
an
arbitrary
line
l
meeting
q
in
two
points

that
the
image
of

line
is
these
societies
can
expect
to
face
difficult
times
as
the
historic
processes
of
modernization
gradually
gain
momentum
their
cohesion
will
be
threatened
by
divisive
forces
the
gaps
between
rulers
and
subjects
town
and
country
will
widen
new
aspirants
for
power
will
emerge
whose
ambitions
far
exceed
their
competence
old
rulers
may
lose
their
nerve
and
their
sense
of
direction
national
leaders
will
have
to
display
the
highest
skills
of
statesmanship
to
guide
their
people
through
times
of
uncertainty
and
confusion
which
destroy
men
s
sense
of
identity
feelings
of
a
community
of
interest
will
have
to
be
recreated
in
some
of
the
new
nations
indeed
they
must
be
built
for
the
first
time
on
a
new
basis
which
looks
toward
the
future
and
does
not
rely
only
on
shared
memories
of
the
past
nevertheless
with
foresight
and
careful
planning
some
of
the
more
disruptive
and
dangerous
consequences
of
social
change
which
have
troubled
other
countries
passing
through
this
stage
can
be
escaped
the
united
states
can
help
by
communicating
a
genuine
concern
with
the
problems
these
countries
face
and
a
readiness
to
provide
technical
and
other
appropriate
forms
of
assistance
where
possible
our
central
goal
should
be
to
provide
the
greatest
positive
incentive
for
these
societies
to
tackle
boldly
the
tasks
which
they
face
at
the
same
time
we
should
recognize
that
the
obstacles
to
change
and
the
lack
of
cohesion
and
stability
which
characterize
these
countries
may
make
them
particularly
prone
to
diversions
and
external
adventures
of
all
sorts
it
may
seem
to
some
of
them
that
success
can
be
purchased
much
less
dearly
by
fishing
in
the
murky
waters
of
international
politics
than
by
facing
up
to
the
intractable
tasks
at
home
we
should
do
what
we
can
to
discourage
this
conclusion
both
by
offering
assistance
for
their
domestic
needs
and
by
reacting
firmly
to
irresponsible
actions
on
the
world
scene
when
necessary
we
should
make
it
clear
that
countries
which
choose
to
derive
marginal
advantages
from
the
cold
war
or
to
exploit
their
potential
for
disrupting
the
security
of
the
world
will
not
only
lose
our
sympathy
but
also
risk
their
own
prospects
for
orderly
development
as
a
nation
we
feel
an
obligation
to
assist
other
countries
in
their
development
but
this
obligation
pertains
only
to
countries
which
are
honestly
seeking
to
become
responsible
members
of
a
stable
and
forward
moving
world
community
transitional
societies
when
we
look
at
countries
like
iran
iraq
pakistan
and
burma
where
substantial
progress
has
been
made
in
creating
a
minimum
supply
of
modern
men
and
of
social
overhead
capital
and
where
institutions
of
centralized
government
exist
we
find
a
second
category
of
countries
with
a
different
set
of
problems
and
hence
different
priorities
for
policy
the
men
in
power
are
committed
in
principle
to
modernization
but
economic
and
social
changes
are
proceeding
only
erratically
isolated
enterprises
have
been
launched
but
they
are
not
yet
related
to
each
other
in
a
meaningful
pattern
the
society
is
likely
to
be
characterized
by
having
a
fairly
modernized
urban
sector
and
a
relatively
untouched
rural
sector
with
very
poor
communications
between
the
two
progress
is
impeded
by
psychological
inhibitions
to
effective
action
among
those
in
power
and
by
a
failure
on
their
part
to
understand
how
local
resources
human
and
material
can
be
mobilized
to
achieve
the
national
goals
of
modernization
already
symbolically
accepted
most
countries
in
this
second
category
share
the
difficulty
of
having
many
of
the
structures
of
a
modern
political
and
social
system
without
the
modern
standards
of
performance
required
to
make
them
effective
in
these
rapidly
changing
societies
there
is
also
too
little
appreciation
of
the
need
for
effort
to
achieve
goals
the
colonial
period
has
generally
left
people
believing
that
government
can
if
it
wishes
provide
all
manner
of
services
for
them
and
that
with
independence
free
men
do
not
have
to
work
to
realize
the
benefits
of
modern
life
for
example
in
accordance
with
the
fashion
of
the
times
most
transitional
societies
have
announced
economic
development
plans
of
varying
numbers
of
years
such
is
the
mystique
of
planning
that
people
expect
that
fulfillment
of
the
plan
will
follow
automatically
upon
its
announcement
the
civil
services
in
such
societies
are
generally
inadequate
to
deal
competently
with
the
problems
facing
them
and
their
members
often
equate
a
government
career
with
security
and
status
rather
than
with
sacrifice
self
discipline
and
competence
american
policy
should
press
constantly
the
view
that
until
these
governments
demand
efficiency
and
effectiveness
of
their
bureaucracies
there
is
not
the
slightest
hope
that
they
will
either
modernize
of
democratize
their
societies
we
should
spread
the
view
that
planning
and
national
development
are
serious
matters
which
call
for
effort
as
well
as
enthusiasm
above
all
we
should
seek
to
encourage
the
leaders
of
these
societies
to
accept
the
unpleasant
fact
that
they
are
responsible
for
their
fates
only
within
the
framework
of
a
mature
relationship
characterized
by
honest
appraisals
of
performance
can
we
provide
telling
assistance
with
respect
to
those
countries
whose
leaders
prefer
to
live
with
their
illusions
we
can
afford
to
wait
for
in
time
their
comparative
lack
of
progress
will
become
clear
for
all
to
see
our
technical
assistance
to
these
countries
should
place
special
emphasis
on
inducing
the
central
governments
to
assume
the
role
of
advisor
and
guide
which
at
an
earlier
stage
foreign
experts
assumed
in
dealing
with
the
central
governments
we
should
encourage
the
governments
to
develop
their
own
technical
assistance
to
communities
state
and
provincial
governments
rural
communities
and
other
smaller
groups
making
certain
that
no
important
segment
of
the
economy
is
neglected
simultaneously
we
should
be
underlining
the
interrelationships
of
technical
progress
in
various
fields
showing
how
agricultural
training
can
be
introduced
into
education
how
health
affects
labor
productivity
how
small
business
can
benefit
the
rural
farm
community
and
above
all
how
progress
in
each
field
relates
to
national
progress
efforts
such
as
the
community
development
program
in
the
philippines
have
demonstrated
that
transitional
societies
can
work
toward
balanced
national
development
to
achieve
this
goal
of
balanced
development
communications
between
the
central
government
and
the
local
communities
must
be
such
that
the
needs
and
aspirations
of
the
people
themselves
are
effectively
taken
into
account
if
modernization
programs
are
imposed
from
above
without
the
understanding
and
cooperation
of
the
people
they
will
encounter
grave
difficulties
land
reform
is
likely
to
be
a
pressing
issue
in
many
of
these
countries
it
should
be
american
policy
not
only
to
encourage
effective
land
reform
programs
but
also
to
underline
the
relation
of
such
reforms
to
the
economic
growth
and
modernization
of
the
society
as
an
isolated
policy
land
reform
is
likely
to
be
politically
disruptive
as
part
of
a
larger
development
effort
however
it
may
gain
wide
acceptance
it
should
also
be
recognized
that
the
problem
of
rural
tenancy
can
not
be
solved
by
administrative
decrees
alone
land
reform
programs
need
to
be
supplemented
with
programs
for
promoting
rural
credits
and
technical
assistance
in
agriculture
lastly
governmental
and
private
planners
will
at
this
stage
begin
to
see
large
capital
requirements
looming
ahead
by
holding
out
prospects
for
external
capital
assistance
the
united
states
can
provide
strong
incentives
to
prepare
for
the
concerted
economic
drive
necessary
to
achieve
self
sustaining
growth
actively
modernizing
societies
at
a
third
stage
in
the
modernization
process
are
such
countries
as
india
brazil
the
philippines
and
taiwan
which
are
ready
and
committed
to
move
into
the
stage
of
self
sustaining
growth
they
must
continue
to
satisfy
basic
capital
needs
and
there
persists
the
dual
problem
of
maintaining
operational
unity
around
a
national
program
of
modernization
while
simultaneously
decentralizing
participation
in
the
program
to
wider
and
wider
groups
but
these
countries
have
made
big
strides
toward
developing
the
necessary
human
and
social
overhead
capital
they
have
established
reasonably
stable
and
effective
governmental
institutions
at
national
and
local
levels
and
they
have
begun
to
develop
a
capacity
to
deal
realistically
and
simultaneously
with
all
the
major
sectors
of
their
economies
on
the
economic
front
the
first
priority
of
these
countries
is
to
mobilize
a
vastly
increased
volume
of
resources
several
related
tasks
must
be
carried
out
if
self
sustaining
growth
is
to
be
achieved
these
countries
must
formulate
a
comprehensive
long
term
program
covering
the
objectives
of
both
the
private
and
the
public
sectors
of
the
economy
they
must
in
their
planning
be
able
to
count
on
at
least
tentative
commitments
of
foreign
capital
assistance
over
periods
of
several
years
capital
imports
drawn
from
a
number
of
sources
must
be
employed
and
combined
skillfully
enough
to
permit
domestic
investment
programming
to
go
forward
capital
flows
must
be
coordinated
with
national
needs
and
planning
finally
a
balance
must
be
effected
among
project
finance
utilization
of
agricultural
surpluses
and
general
balance
of
payments
support
thus
although
the
agenda
of
external
assistance
in
the
economic
sphere
are
cumulative
and
many
of
the
policies
suggested
for
nations
in
the
earlier
stages
remain
relevant
the
basic
purpose
of
american
economic
policy
during
the
later
stages
of
development
should
be
to
assure
that
movement
into
a
stage
of
self
sustaining
growth
is
not
prevented
by
lack
of
foreign
exchange
there
remain
many
political
and
administrative
problems
to
be
solved
for
one
thing
although
considerable
numbers
of
men
have
been
trained
bureaucracies
are
still
deficient
in
many
respects
even
the
famed
indian
civil
service
is
not
fully
adequate
to
the
tremendous
range
of
tasks
it
has
undertaken
technical
assistance
in
training
middle
and
upper
level
management
personnel
is
still
needed
in
many
cases
there
are
also
more
basic
problems
this
is
the
stage
at
which
democratic
developments
must
take
place
if
the
society
is
to
become
an
open
community
of
creative
people
nevertheless
impulses
still
exist
among
the
ruling
elite
to
rationalize
and
thus
to
perpetuate
the
need
for
centralized
and
authoritarian
practices
another
great
danger
is
that
the
emerging
middle
class
will
feel
itself
increasingly
alienated
from
the
political
leaders
who
still
justify
their
dominance
by
reference
to
the
struggle
for
independence
or
the
early
phase
of
nationalism
the
capacity
of
intellectuals
and
members
of
the
new
professional
classes
to
contribute
creatively
to
national
development
is
likely
to
be
destroyed
by
a
constraining
sense
of
inferiority
toward
both
their
own
political
class
and
their
colleagues
and
professional
counterparts
in
the
west
particularly
when
based
upon
a
single
dominant
party
governments
may
respond
to
such
a
situation
by
claiming
a
monopoly
of
understanding
about
the
national
interest
convinced
of
the
wisdom
of
their
own
actions
and
reassured
by
the
promises
of
their
economic
development
programs
governments
may
fail
to
push
outward
to
win
more
and
more
people
to
the
national
effort
becoming
instead
more
rigid
and
inflexible
in
their
policies
american
policy
toward
such
societies
should
stress
our
sympathy
for
the
emerging
social
and
professional
classes
it
should
attempt
to
communicate
both
an
appreciation
of
professional
standards
and
an
understanding
of
the
tremendous
powers
and
potentialities
of
genuinely
open
and
pluralistic
societies
we
have
every
obligation
to
take
seriously
their
claims
to
being
democratic
and
free
countries
we
also
have
in
consequence
the
duty
to
appraise
realistically
and
honestly
their
performance
and
to
communicate
our
judgments
to
their
leaders
in
frank
but
friendly
ways
the
time
factor
we
have
emphasized
that
the
modernizing
process
in
each
society
will
take
a
considerable
period
of
time
with
the
exception
of
treaty
making
foreign
relations
were
historically
concerned
for
the
most
part
with
conditions
of
short
or
at
least
measurable
duration
foreign
policy
now
takes
on
a
different
perspective
and
must
become
skilled
not
merely
at
response
but
also
at
projection
american
and
free
world
policies
can
marginally
affect
the
pace
of
transition
but
basically
that
pace
depends
on
changes
in
the
supply
of
resources
and
in
the
human
attitudes
political
institutions
and
social
structure
which
each
society
must
generate
it
follows
that
any
effective
policy
toward
the
underdeveloped
countries
must
have
a
realistically
long
working
horizon
it
must
be
marked
by
a
patience
and
persistence
which
have
not
always
been
its
trademark
this
condition
affects
not
only
the
conception
but
also
the
legislative
and
financial
support
of
foreign
policy
especially
in
the
context
of
economic
aid
ii
some
of
the
major
functions
of
religion
the
place
of
religion
in
the
simple
preliterate
societies
is
quite
definite
as
a
complex
it
fits
into
the
whole
social
organization
and
functions
dominantly
in
every
part
of
it
in
societies
like
ours
however
its
place
is
less
clear
and
more
complex
with
the
diversity
of
religious
viewpoints
there
are
differences
of
opinion
as
to
the
essential
features
of
religion
and
there
are
different
opinions
as
to
the
essential
functions
of
religion
nevertheless
for
most
of
the
population
of
heterogeneous
advanced
societies
though
less
for
the
less
religious
portion
religion
does
perform
certain
modal
individual
and
social
functions
although
the
inner
functions
of
religion
are
not
of
direct
significance
in
social
organization
they
have
important
indirect
consequences
if
the
inner
functions
of
religion
are
performed
the
individual
is
a
composed
ordered
motivated
and
emotionally
secure
associate
he
is
not
greatly
frustrated
and
he
is
not
anomic
he
is
better
fitted
to
perform
his
social
life
among
his
fellows
there
are
several
closely
related
inner
functions
in
the
last
analysis
religion
is
the
means
of
inducing
formulating
expressing
enhancing
implementing
and
perpetuating
man
s
deepest
experience
the
religious
man
is
first
religious
the
instrumentalities
follow
religion
seeks
to
satisfy
human
needs
of
great
pertinence
the
significant
things
in
it
at
the
higher
religious
levels
are
the
inner
emotional
mental
and
spiritual
occurrences
that
fill
the
pressing
human
needs
of
self
preservation
self
pacification
and
self
completion
the
chief
experience
is
the
sensing
of
communion
and
in
the
higher
religions
of
a
harmonious
relationship
with
the
supernatural
power
related
to
this
is
the
fact
that
most
of
the
higher
religions
define
for
the
individual
his
place
in
the
universe
and
give
him
a
feeling
that
he
is
relatively
secure
in
an
ordered
dependable
universe
man
has
the
experience
of
being
helpfully
allied
with
what
he
can
not
fully
understand
he
is
a
coordinate
part
of
all
of
the
mysterious
energy
and
being
and
movement
the
universe
is
a
safe
and
permanent
home
a
number
of
religions
also
satisfy
for
many
the
need
of
being
linked
with
the
ultimate
and
eternal
death
is
not
permanent
defeat
and
disappearance
man
has
a
second
chance
he
is
not
lost
in
the
abyss
of
endless
time
he
has
endless
being
religion
at
its
best
also
offers
the
experience
of
spiritual
fulfillment
by
inviting
man
into
the
highest
realm
of
the
spirit
religion
can
summate
epitomize
relate
and
conserve
all
the
highest
ideals
and
values
ethical
aesthetic
and
religious
of
man
formed
in
his
culture
there
is
also
the
possibility
among
higher
religions
of
experiencing
consistent
meaning
in
life
and
enjoying
guidance
and
expansiveness
the
kind
of
religious
experience
that
most
moderns
seek
not
only
provides
clarifies
and
relates
human
yearnings
values
ideals
and
purposes
it
also
provides
facilities
and
incitements
for
the
development
of
personality
sociality
and
creativeness
under
the
religious
impulse
whether
theistic
or
humanistic
men
have
joy
in
living
life
leads
somewhere
religion
at
its
best
is
out
in
front
ever
beckoning
and
leading
on
and
as
lippman
put
it
mobilizing
all
man
s
scattered
energies
in
one
triumphant
sense
of
his
own
infinite
importance
at
the
same
time
that
religion
binds
the
individual
helpfully
to
the
supernatural
and
gives
him
cosmic
peace
and
a
sense
of
supreme
fulfillment
it
also
has
great
therapeutic
value
for
him
it
gives
him
aid
comfort
even
solace
in
meeting
mundane
life
situations
where
his
own
unassisted
practical
knowledge
and
skill
are
felt
by
him
to
be
inadequate
he
is
confronted
with
the
recurrent
crises
such
as
great
natural
catastrophes
and
the
great
transitions
of
life
marriage
incurable
disease
widowhood
old
age
the
certainty
of
death
he
has
to
cope
with
frustration
and
other
emotional
disturbance
and
anomie
his
religious
beliefs
provide
him
with
plausible
explanations
for
many
conditions
which
cause
him
great
concern
and
his
religious
faith
makes
possible
fortitude
equanimity
and
consolation
enabling
him
to
endure
colossal
misfortune
fear
frustration
uncertainty
suffering
evil
and
danger
religion
usually
also
includes
a
principle
of
compensation
mainly
in
a
promised
perfect
future
state
the
belief
in
immortality
where
held
functions
as
a
redress
for
the
ills
and
disappointments
of
the
here
and
now
the
tensions
accompanying
a
repressive
consciousness
of
wrongdoing
or
sinning
or
some
tormenting
secret
are
relieved
for
the
less
self
contained
or
self
sufficient
by
confession
repentance
and
penance
the
feeling
of
individual
inferiority
defeat
or
humilation
growing
out
of
various
social
situations
or
individual
deficiencies
or
failures
is
compensated
for
by
communion
in
worship
or
prayer
with
a
friendly
but
all
victorious
father
god
as
well
as
by
sympathetic
fellowship
with
others
who
share
this
faith
and
by
opportunities
in
religious
acts
for
giving
vent
to
emotions
and
energies
in
providing
for
these
inner
individual
functions
religion
undertakes
in
behalf
of
individual
peace
of
mind
and
well
being
services
for
which
there
is
no
other
institution
in
addition
to
the
functions
of
religion
within
man
there
have
always
been
the
outer
social
functions
for
the
community
and
society
the
two
have
never
been
separable
religion
is
vitally
necessary
in
both
societal
maintenance
and
regulation
the
value
system
of
a
community
or
society
is
always
correlated
with
and
to
a
degree
dependent
upon
a
more
or
less
shared
system
of
religious
beliefs
and
convictions
the
religion
supports
re
enforces
reaffirms
and
maintains
the
fundamental
values
even
in
the
united
states
with
its
freedom
of
religious
belief
and
worship
and
its
vast
denominational
differentiation
there
is
a
general
consensus
regarding
the
basic
christian
values
this
is
demonstrated
especially
when
there
is
awareness
of
radically
different
value
orientation
elsewhere
for
example
americans
rally
to
christian
values
vis
a
vis
those
of
atheistic
communism
in
america
also
all
of
our
major
religious
bodies
officially
sanction
a
universalistic
ethic
which
is
reflective
of
our
common
religion
even
the
non
church
members
the
freewheelers
marginal
religionists
and
so
on
have
the
values
of
christian
civilization
internalized
in
them
furthermore
religion
tends
to
integrate
the
whole
range
of
values
from
the
highest
or
ultimate
values
of
god
to
the
intermediary
and
subordinate
values
for
example
those
regarding
material
objects
and
pragmatic
ends
finally
it
gives
sanctity
more
than
human
legitimacy
and
even
through
super
empirical
reference
transcendent
and
supernatural
importance
to
some
values
for
example
marriage
as
a
sacrament
much
law
breaking
as
sinful
occasionally
the
state
as
a
divine
instrument
it
places
certain
values
at
least
beyond
questioning
and
tampering
closely
related
to
this
function
is
the
fact
that
the
religious
system
provides
a
body
of
ultimate
ends
for
the
society
which
are
compatible
with
the
supreme
eternal
ends
this
something
leads
to
a
conception
of
an
over
all
social
plan
with
a
meaning
interpretable
in
terms
of
ultimate
ends
for
example
a
plan
that
fulfills
the
will
of
god
which
advances
the
kingdom
of
god
which
involves
social
life
as
part
of
the
grand
design
this
explains
some
group
ends
and
provides
a
justification
of
their
primacy
it
gives
social
guidance
and
direction
and
makes
for
programs
of
social
action
finally
it
gives
meaning
to
much
social
endeavor
and
logic
consistency
and
meaning
to
life
in
general
there
is
no
society
so
secularized
as
to
be
completely
without
religiously
inspired
transcendental
ends
religion
integrates
and
unifies
some
of
the
oldest
most
persistent
and
most
cohesive
forms
of
social
groupings
have
grown
out
of
religion
these
groups
have
varied
widely
from
mere
families
primitive
totemic
groups
and
small
modern
cults
and
sects
to
the
memberships
of
great
denominations
and
great
widely
dispersed
world
religions
religion
fosters
group
life
in
various
ways
the
common
ultimate
values
ends
and
goals
fostered
by
religion
are
a
most
important
factor
without
a
system
of
values
there
can
be
no
society
where
such
a
value
system
prevails
it
always
unifies
all
who
possess
it
it
enables
members
of
the
society
to
operate
as
a
system
the
beliefs
of
a
religion
also
reflecting
the
values
are
expressed
in
creeds
dogmas
and
doctrines
and
form
what
durkheim
calls
a
credo
as
he
points
out
a
religious
group
can
not
exist
without
a
collective
credo
and
the
more
extensive
the
credo
the
more
unified
and
strong
is
the
group
the
credo
unifies
and
socializes
men
by
attaching
them
completely
to
an
identical
body
of
doctrine
the
more
extensive
and
firm
the
body
of
doctrine
the
firmer
the
group
the
religious
symbolism
and
especially
the
closely
related
rites
and
worship
forms
constitute
a
powerful
bond
for
the
members
of
the
particular
faith
the
religion
in
fact
is
an
expression
of
the
unity
of
the
group
small
or
large
the
common
codes
for
religious
action
as
such
and
in
their
ethical
aspects
for
everyday
moral
behavior
bind
the
devotees
together
these
are
ways
of
jointly
participating
in
significantly
symbolized
standardized
and
ordered
religiously
sanctified
behavior
the
codes
are
mechanism
for
training
in
and
directing
and
enforcing
uniform
social
interaction
and
for
continually
and
publicly
reasserting
the
solidarity
of
the
group
durkheim
noted
long
ago
that
religion
as
a
unified
system
of
beliefs
and
practices
relative
to
sacred
things
unite
s
into
one
single
moral
community
all
those
who
adhere
to
them
his
view
is
that
every
religion
pertains
to
a
community
and
conversely
every
community
is
in
one
aspect
a
religious
unit
this
is
brought
out
in
the
common
religious
ethos
that
prevails
even
in
the
denominationally
diverse
audiences
at
many
secular
semi
public
and
public
occasions
in
the
united
states
and
it
is
evidenced
in
the
prayers
offered
in
the
frequent
religious
allusions
and
in
the
confirmation
of
points
on
religious
grounds
the
unifying
effect
of
religion
is
also
brought
out
in
the
fact
that
historically
peoples
have
clung
together
as
more
or
less
cohesive
cultural
units
with
religion
as
the
dominant
bond
even
though
spatially
dispersed
and
not
politically
organized
the
jews
for
years
have
been
a
prime
example
though
the
adherents
of
any
world
or
interpeople
religion
are
cases
in
point
it
might
be
pointed
out
that
the
integrating
function
of
religion
for
good
or
ill
has
often
supported
or
been
identified
with
other
groupings
political
nationality
language
class
racial
sociability
even
economic
religion
usually
exercises
a
stabilizing
conserving
function
as
such
it
acts
as
an
anchor
for
the
people
there
is
a
marked
tendency
for
religions
once
firmly
established
to
resist
change
not
only
in
their
own
doctrines
and
policies
and
practices
but
also
in
secular
affairs
having
religious
relevance
it
has
thus
been
a
significant
factor
in
the
conservation
of
social
values
though
also
in
some
measure
an
obstacle
to
the
creation
or
diffusion
of
new
ones
it
tends
to
support
the
longstanding
precious
sentiments
the
traditional
ways
of
thinking
and
the
customary
ways
of
living
as
yinger
has
pointed
out
the
reliance
on
symbols
on
tradition
on
sacred
writings
on
the
cultivation
of
emotional
feelings
of
identity
and
harmony
with
sacred
values
turns
one
to
the
past
far
more
than
to
the
future
historically
religion
has
also
functioned
as
a
tremendous
engine
of
vindication
enforcement
sanction
and
perpetuation
of
various
other
institutions
at
the
same
time
that
religion
exercises
a
conserving
influence
it
also
energizes
and
motivates
both
individuals
and
groups
much
of
the
important
individual
and
social
action
has
been
owing
to
religious
incentives
the
great
ultimate
ends
of
religion
have
served
as
magnificent
beacon
lights
that
lured
people
toward
them
with
an
almost
irresistible
force
mobilizing
energies
and
inducing
sacrifices
for
example
the
crusades
mission
efforts
just
wars
much
effort
has
been
expended
in
the
sincere
effort
to
apply
the
teaching
and
admonitions
of
religion
the
insuperable
reward
systems
that
most
religions
embody
have
great
motivating
effects
religion
provides
the
most
attractive
rewards
either
in
this
world
or
the
next
for
those
who
not
merely
abide
by
its
norms
but
who
engage
in
good
works
religion
usually
acts
as
a
powerful
aid
in
social
control
enforcing
what
men
should
or
should
not
do
among
primitive
peoples
the
sanctions
and
dictates
of
religion
were
more
binding
than
any
of
the
other
controls
exercised
by
the
group
and
in
modern
societies
such
influence
is
still
great
religion
has
its
own
supernatural
prescriptions
that
are
at
the
same
time
codes
of
behavior
for
the
here
and
now
overwhelmed
with
the
care
of
five
young
children
and
concerned
about
persistent
economic
difficulties
due
to
her
husband
s
marginal
income
her
defense
of
denial
was
excessively
strong
thus
the
lack
of
effective
recognition
of
the
responsibilities
involved
in
caring
for
two
babies
showed
signs
of
becoming
a
disabling
problem
the
result
dramatically
visible
in
a
matter
of
days
in
the
family
s
disrupted
daily
functioning
was
a
phobic
like
fear
that
some
terrible
harm
would
befall
the
second
twin
whose
birth
had
not
been
anticipated
soon
mrs
b
s
fears
threatened
to
burst
into
a
full
blown
panic
concerning
the
welfare
of
the
entire
family
inability
to
care
for
the
other
children
difficulty
in
feeding
the
babies
who
seemed
colicky
bone
weary
fatigue
repeated
crying
episodes
and
short
tempers
reflected
the
family
s
helplessness
in
coping
with
the
stressful
situation
clearly
this
was
a
family
in
crisis
mrs
b
compared
her
feelings
of
weakness
to
her
feelings
of
weakness
and
helplessness
at
the
time
of
her
mother
s
death
when
she
was
eight
as
well
as
her
subsequent
anger
at
her
father
for
remarrying
her
previous
traumatic
experiences
flashed
through
her
mind
as
if
they
had
happened
yesterday
on
the
anniversary
of
her
father
s
death
she
poured
out
with
agonized
tears
her
feelings
of
guilt
about
not
having
attended
his
funeral
in
the
family
s
own
words
during
the
third
of
twelve
visits
they
had
reached
the
crisis
peak
either
the
situation
will
give
or
we
will
break
direct
confrontation
and
acceptance
of
mrs
b
s
anger
against
the
second
baby
soon
dissipated
her
fears
of
annihilation
abreaction
of
her
anxiety
and
guilt
concerning
the
death
of
her
parents
when
linked
up
with
her
current
feelings
of
anger
and
her
fears
of
loss
abandonment
and
annihilation
produced
further
relief
of
tension
in
a
joint
interview
mr
and
mrs
b
were
helped
to
understand
the
meaning
of
a
younger
son
s
wandering
away
from
home
in
terms
of
his
feelings
of
displacement
in
reaction
to
the
arrival
of
the
twins
the
father
accurately
perceiving
the
child
s
needs
not
only
respected
them
as
worthy
of
his
attention
but
immediately
satisfied
them
by
taking
him
on
his
lap
along
with
the
twins
saying
i
have
a
big
lap
there
is
room
for
you

and

worker

continued
success
in
the
care
of
the
new
babies
as
well
as
a
marked
improvement
in
the
family
s
day
to
day
mental
health
and
social
functioning
as
seen
in
the
b
family
there
must
be
an
attempt
to
help
the
client
develop
conscious
awareness
of
the
problem
especially
in
the
absence
of
a
formal
request
for
assistance
the
lack
of
awareness
usually
springs
from
deep
but
disguised
anxiety
often
assuming
the
superficial
guise
of
not
knowing
or
not
caring
the
unhealthy
use
of
denial
in
the
initial
reaction
to
a
stress
must
be
handled
through
the
medium
of
a
positive
controlled
transference
in
general
the
approach
is
more
active
than
passive
more
out
reaching
than
reflective
while
some
regression
is
inevitable
it
is
discouraged
rather
than
encouraged
so
that
the
transference
does
not
follow
the
stages
of
planned
regression
associated
with
certain
casework
adaptations
of
the
psychoanalytic
model
for
insight
therapy
to
establish
an
emotionally
meaningful
relationship
the
worker
must
demonstrate
actual
or
potential
helpfulness
immediately
preferably
within
the
first
interview
by
meeting
the
client
s
specific
needs
these
needs
usually
concern
the
reduction
of
guilt
and
some
relief
of
tension
the
initial
interview
must
be
therapeutic
rather
than
purely
exploratory
in
an
information
seeking
sense
in
this
relationship
building
stage
the
worker
must
communicate
confidence
in
the
client
s
ability
to
deal
with
the
problem
in
so
doing
he
implicitly
offers
the
positive
contagion
of
hope
as
a
kind
of
maturational
dynamic
to
counteract
feelings
of
helplessness
and
hopelessness
generally
associated
with
the
first
stages
of
stress
impact
thus
the
client
receives
enough
ego
support
to
engage
in
constructive
efforts
on
his
own
behalf
here
there
is
a
specific
preventive
component
which
applies
in
a
more
generalized
sense
to
any
casework
situation
we
are
preventing
or
averting
pathogenic
phenomena
such
as
undue
regression
unhealthy
suppression
and
repression
excessive
use
of
denial
and
crippling
guilt
turned
against
the
self
while
some
suppression
and
some
denial
are
not
only
necessary
but
healthy
the
worker
s
clinical
knowledge
must
determine
how
these
defenses
are
being
used
what
healthy
shifts
in
defensive
adaptation
are
indicated
and
when
efforts
at
bringing
about
change
can
be
most
effectively
timed
in
steering
the
family
toward
ego
adaptive
and
away
from
maladaptive
responses
the
worker
uses
time
honored
focused
casework
techniques
of
specific
emotional
support
clarification
and
anticipatory
guidance
over
a
relatively
short
period
of
time
usually
about
four
to
twelve
weeks
the
worker
must
be
able
to
shift
the
focus
back
and
forth
between
immediate
external
stressful
exigencies
precipitating
stress
and
the
key
emotionally
relevant
issues
underlying
problem
which
are
often
in
a
dramatic
preconscious
breakthrough
reactivated
by
the
crisis
situation
and
hence
once
again
amenable
to
resolution
though
there
is
obviously
nothing
new
about
these
techniques
they
do
challenge
the
worker
s
skill
to
articulate
them
precisely
on
the
spot
and
on
the
basis
of
quick
and
accurate
diagnostic
assessments
then
too
the
utmost
clinical
flexibility
is
necessary
in
judiciously
combining
carefully
timed
family
oriented
home
visits
single
and
group
office
interviews
and
appropriate
telephone
follow
up
calls
if
the
worker
is
to
be
genuinely
accessible
and
if
the
predicted
unhealthy
outcome
is
to
be
actually
averted
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
preventive
intervention
in
addition
in
many
cases
a
variety
of
concrete
social
resources
homemaker
day
care
medical
and
financial
aid
must
be
reasonably
available
for
the
reality
support
needed
to
bolster
the
family
in
its
individual
and
collective
coping
and
integrative
efforts
at
certain
critical
stages
and
only
for
sound
diagnostic
reasons
it
may
be
important
to
accompany
family
members
in
their
use
of
these
resources
if
their
problem
solving
behavior
is
to
be
constructive
rather
than
defeating
while
expensive
in
time
and
involving
a
great
deal
of
adaptation
on
the
part
of
the
worker
in
terms
of
his
willingness
to
leave
the
sanctity
of
his
office
and
enter
actively
into
the
client
s
life
techniques
of
accompaniment
were
found
to
be
of
tremendous
value
when
in
the
service
of
specific
preventive
objectives
finally
whatever
the
techniques
used
a
twin
goal
is
common
to
all
preventive
casework
service
to
cushion
or
reduce
the
force
of
the
stress
impact
while
at
the
same
time
to
encourage
and
support
family
members
to
mobilize
and
use
their
ego
capacities
having
outlined
an
approach
to
the
theory
and
practice
of
preventive
casework
we
now
address
ourselves
to
our
final
question
what
place
should
brief
crisis
oriented
preventive
casework
occupy
in
our
total
spectrum
of
services
we
should
first
recognize
our
tendency
to
develop
a
hierarchy
of
values
locating
brief
treatment
at
the
bottom
and
long
term
intensive
service
at
the
top
instead
of
seeing
the
services
as
part
of
a
continuum
each
important
in
its
own
right
this
problem
is
perhaps
as
old
as
social
casework
itself
almost
three
decades
ago
bertha
reynolds
undertook
a
study
of
short
contact
interviewing
because
of
her
conviction
that
short
term
casework
had
an
important
but
neglected
place
in
our
network
of
social
services
her
conclusion
has
been
borne
out
in
the
experience
of
many
practitioners
short
contact
interviewing
is
neither
a
truncated
nor
a
telescoped
experience
but
is
of
the
same
essential
quality
as
the
so
called
intensive
case
work
thus
casework
involving
a
limited
number
of
interviews
is
still
to
be
regarded
in
terms
of
the
quality
of
service
rendered
rather
than
of
the
quantity
of
time
expended
that
we
are
experiencing
an
upsurge
of
interest
in
the
many
formulations
and
preventive
adaptations
of
brief
treatment
in
social
casework
is
evident
from
even
a
small
sampling
of
current
literature
especially
noteworthy
is
levinger
s
finding
that
the
length
of
treatment
per
se
is
not
a
reliable
indicator
of
successful
outcome
according
to
a
number
of
studies
the
important
predictors
are
the
nature
and
management
of
the
client
s
anxiety
as
well
as
the
accessibility
of
the
helping
person
for
example
the
level
of
improvement
noted
in
a
recent
experiment
with
a
short
course
of
immediate
treatment
for
parent
child
relationship
problems
compared
favorably
with
the
results
reported
by
typical
child
guidance
clinics
where
the
hours
spent
in
purely
diagnostic
study
may
equal
or
exceed
the
number
of
hours
devoted
to
actual
treatment
interviews
in
the
experimental
project
of
startling
significance
too
is
the
assertion
that
it
was
possible
to
carry
out
this
program
with
only
a
percent
attrition
rate
as
compared
with
a
rate
of
percent
reported
for
a
comparable
group
of
families
who
were
receiving
help
in
traditionally
operated
child
guidance
services
these
reports
refer
to
a
level
of
secondary
prevention
in
a
child
guidance
clinic
approached
by
the
customary
route
of
voluntary
referral
by
the
family
or
by
other
professional
people
similarities
to
the
approach
which
i
have
described
are
evident
in
the
prompt
establishment
of
a
helping
relationship
quick
appraisal
of
key
issues
and
the
immediate
mobilization
of
treatment
plans
as
the
essential
dynamics
in
helping
to
further
the
ego
s
coping
efforts
in
dealing
with
the
interplay
of
inner
and
outer
stresses
while
there
are
many
different
possibilities
for
the
timing
of
casework
intervention
the
experiments
recently
reported
from
a
variety
of
traditional
settings
all
point
up
the
importance
of
an
immediate
response
to
the
client
s
initial
need
for
help
in
some
programs
treatment
is
concentrated
over
a
short
period
of
time
while
in
others
after
the
initial
contact
is
established
flexible
spacing
of
interviews
has
been
experimentally
used
with
apparent
success
willingness
to
take
the
risk
of
early
and
direct
interpretation
with
the
proviso
that
if
the
interpretation
is
too
threatening
the
worker
can
withdraw
is
another
prominent
feature
in
these
efforts
my
aim
in
mentioning
this
factor
obviously
is
not
to
give
license
to
wild
therapy
but
rather
to
encourage
us
to
use
the
time
honored
clinical
casework
skills
we
already
possess
and
to
use
them
with
greater
confidence
precision
and
professional
pride
though
there
is
obviously
great
need
for
continued
experimentation
with
various
types
of
short
term
intervention
to
further
efforts
in
developing
an
operational
definition
of
prevention
at
the
secondary
or
perhaps
in
some
instances
primary
level
the
place
of
short
term
intervention
has
already
been
documented
by
a
number
of
investigators
in
a
wide
variety
of
settings
woodward
for
example
has
emphasized
the
need
for
a
broad
spectrum
of
services
including
very
brief
services
in
connection
with
critical
situations
ideally
brief
treatment
should
be
arrived
at
as
a
treatment
of
choice
rather
than
as
a
treatment
of
chance
moreover
the
shortage
of
treatment
resources
and
the
chronically
persistent
shortage
of
mental
health
manpower
force
us
to
innovate
additional
refinements
of
preventive
intervention
techniques
to
make
services
more
widely
available
and
on
a
more
effective
basis
to
more
people
further
research
in
the
meaning
of
crises
as
experienced
by
the
consumers
of
traditional
social
casework
services
including
attempts
to
develop
a
typology
of
family
structures
crisis
problems
reaction
mechanisms
and
differential
treatment
approaches
and
the
establishment
of
new
experimental
programs
are
imperative
social
needs
which
should
command
the
best
efforts
of
caseworkers
in
collaboration
with
community
planners
our
literature
is
already
replete
with
a
fantastic
number
of
suggestions
for
preventive
agency
programming
ranging
from
the
immediately
practical
to
the
globally
utopian
probably
in
the
immediate
future
we
will
have
to
settle
for
middle
range
efforts
that
fall
short
of
utopian
models
increased
experimentation
with
multipurpose
agencies
especially
those
that
combine
afresh
the
traditional
functions
of
family
and
child
welfare
services
holds
rich
promise
for
the
future
for
example
child
welfare
experience
abounds
with
cases
in
which
the
parental
request
for
substitute
care
is
precipitated
by
a
crisis
event
which
is
meaningfully
linked
with
a
fundamental
unresolved
problem
of
family
relationships
dan
morgan
told
himself
he
would
forget
ann
turner
he
was
well
rid
of
her
he
certainly
did
n
t
want
a
wife
who
was
fickle
as
ann
if
he
had
married
her
he
d
have
been
asking
for
trouble
but
all
of
this
was
rationalization
sometimes
he
woke
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
thinking
of
ann
and
then
could
not
get
back
to
sleep
his
plans
and
dreams
had
revolved
around
her
so
much
and
for
so
long
that
now
he
felt
as
if
he
had
nothing
the
easiest
thing
would
be
to
sell
out
to
al
budd
and
leave
the
country
but
there
was
a
stubborn
streak
in
him
that
would
n
t
allow
it
the
best
antidote
for
the
bitterness
and
disappointment
that
poisoned
him
was
hard
work
he
found
that
if
he
was
tired
enough
at
night
he
went
to
sleep
simply
because
he
was
too
exhausted
to
stay
awake
each
day
he
found
himself
thinking
less
often
of
ann
each
day
the
hurt
was
a
little
duller
a
little
less
poignant
he
had
plenty
of
work
to
do
because
the
summer
was
unusually
dry
and
hot
the
spring
produced
a
smaller
stream
than
in
ordinary
years
the
grass
in
the
meadows
came
fast
now
that
the
warm
weather
was
here
he
could
not
afford
to
lose
a
drop
of
the
precious
water
so
he
spent
most
of
his
waking
hours
along
the
ditches
in
his
meadows
he
had
no
idea
how
much
time
budd
would
give
him
in
any
case
he
had
no
intention
of
being
caught
asleep
so
he
carried
his
revolver
in
its
holster
on
his
hip
and
he
took
his
winchester
with
him
and
leaned
it
against
the
fence
he
stopped
every
few
minutes
and
leaned
on
his
shovel
as
he
studied
the
horizon
but
nothing
happened
each
day
dragging
out
with
monotonous
calm
when
in
late
afternoon
on
the
last
day
in
june
he
saw
two
people
top
the
ridge
to
the
south
and
walk
toward
the
house
he
quit
work
immediately
and
strode
to
his
rifle
it
could
be
some
kind
of
trick
budd
had
thought
up
no
one
walked
in
this
country
least
of
all
ed
dow
or
dutch
renfro
or
any
of
the
rest
of
the
bar
b
crew
morgan
watched
the
two
figures
for
a
time
puzzled
when
they
were
closer
and
he
saw
that
one
was
a
woman
he
was
more
puzzled
than
ever
he
cleaned
his
shovel
left
it
against
the
fence
picked
up
his
winchester
and
started
downstream
his
visitors
had
crawled
through
the
south
fence
and
were
crossing
the
meadow
angling
toward
the
house
now
he
saw
that
both
the
man
and
woman
were
moving
slowly
and
irregularly
staggering
as
if
they
found
it
a
struggle
to
remain
on
their
feet
reaching
the
house
ahead
of
them
he
waited
with
his
winchester
in
his
hands
they
crawled
through
the
north
fence
and
came
on
toward
him
and
now
he
saw
that
both
were
young
not
more
than
nineteen
or
twenty
they
were
dirty
their
clothes
were
torn
and
the
girl
was
so
exhausted
that
she
fell
when
she
was
still
twenty
feet
from
the
front
door
she
lay
there
making
no
effort
to
get
back
on
her
feet
the
boy
came
on
to
the
porch
and
sat
down
his
gaze
on
morgan
as
if
half
expecting
him
to
shoot
and
not
really
caring
morgan
hesitated
thinking
that
if
this
was
a
trick
it
was
a
good
one
he
did
n
t
think
it
was
possible
for
this
couple
to
be
pretending
the
boy
licked
his
dry
lips
he
asked
could
we
have
a
drink
morgan
jerked
his
head
toward
the
front
door
in
the
kitchen
he
said
leaning
his
winchester
against
the
front
of
the
house
he
walked
to
the
girl
get
up
there
s
water
in
the
house
she
did
n
t
move
or
say
anything
her
eyes
were
glazed
as
if
she
did
n
t
hear
or
even
see
him
she
had
reached
a
point
at
which
she
did
n
t
even
care
how
she
looked
her
face
was
very
thin
and
burned
by
the
sun
until
much
of
the
skin
was
dead
and
peeling
the
new
skin
under
it
red
and
angry
her
blond
hair
was
frowzy
her
dress
torn
in
several
places
and
her
shoes
were
so
completely
worn
out
that
they
were
practically
no
protection
it
must
have
hurt
her
even
to
walk
for
the
sole
was
completely
off
her
left
foot
and
morgan
saw
that
it
was
bruised
and
bleeding
he
picked
her
up
sliding
one
hand
under
her
shoulders
the
other
under
her
knees
and
carried
her
into
the
house
she
was
amazingly
light
and
so
relaxed
in
his
arms
that
he
was
n
t
even
sure
she
was
conscious
any
lingering
suspicion
that
this
was
a
trick
al
budd
had
thought
up
was
dispelled
no
girl
would
go
this
far
to
fool
a
man
so
she
could
kill
him
besides
she
had
a
sweet
face
that
attracted
him
he
put
her
down
on
the
couch
and
going
into
the
kitchen
saw
that
the
boy
had
dropped
into
a
chair
beside
the
table
they
looked
a
good
deal
alike
morgan
thought
both
had
blonde
hair
and
blue
eyes
and
there
was
even
a
faint
similarity
of
features
morgan
filled
the
dipper
from
the
water
bucket
on
the
shelf
went
back
into
the
front
room
lifted
the
girl
s
head
and
held
the
edge
of
the
dipper
to
her
mouth
she
drank
greedily
and
murmured
thank
you
as
he
lowered
her
head
he
stood
looking
down
at
her
for
a
moment
wondering
what
could
have
reduced
her
to
this
condition
he
had
seen
a
few
nester
wagons
go
through
the
country
the
families
almost
starving
to
death
but
he
had
never
seen
any
of
them
on
foot
and
as
bad
off
as
these
two
the
girl
dropped
off
to
sleep
morgan
returned
to
the
kitchen
built
a
fire
and
carried
in
several
buckets
of
water
from
the
spring
which
he
poured
into
the
copper
boiler
that
he
had
placed
on
the
stove
he
brought
his
winchester
in
from
the
front
of
the
house
then
faced
the
boy
who
are
you
and
what
happened
to
you
he
asked
i
m
billy
jones
the
boy
answered
that
s
my
wife
sharon
we
ran
out
of
money
and
we
have
n
t
eaten
for
two
days
what
are
you
doing
here
are
we
in
wyoming
morgan
nodded
about
five
miles
north
of
the
line
jones
sighed
as
if
relieved
we
ve
been
looking
for
work
but
all
the
ranchers
have
turned
us
down
you
mean
you
dragged
your
wife
all
over
hell
s
half
acre
looking
for
work
morgan
demanded
the
town
of
buckhorn
s
only
about
six
miles
from
here
why
did
n
t
you
go
there
we
did
n
t
want
town
work
jones
said
this
is
a
mighty
empty
country
morgan
said
there
s
only
one
more
ranch
three
miles
north
of
here
you
d
have
starved
to
death
if
you
d
missed
both
places
then
we
re
lucky
we
got
here
could
you
give
us
a
job
mr
morgan
dan
morgan
he
was
silent
a
moment
thinking
he
could
use
a
man
this
time
of
year
and
if
the
girl
could
cook
it
would
give
him
more
time
in
the
meadows
but
he
knew
nothing
about
the
couple
they
might
kill
him
in
his
sleep
thinking
there
was
money
in
the
house
he
dismissed
the
possibility
at
once
the
girl
s
thin
face
haunted
him
it
was
n
t
the
face
of
a
killer
he
was
n
t
so
sure
about
the
boy
he
had
n
t
shaved
for
several
weeks
his
sparse
beard
giving
his
face
a
pathetic
woebegone
expression
there
was
more
to
this
than
jones
had
told
him
they
were
running
from
something
he
d
be
an
idiot
to
let
them
stay
he
thought
but
he
could
n
t
send
them
on
either
i
could
use
some
help
morgan
said
finally
but
i
ca
n
t
afford
to
pay
you
anything
i
guess
you
d
better
go
on
in
the
morning
we
ll
work
for
our
keep
the
boy
said
eagerly
i
ve
been
mucking
in
a
mine
in
the
san
juan
but
i
used
to
work
on
a
ranch
sharon
she
s
cooked
in
a
restaurant
we
ll
work
hard
mr
morgan
i
ll
see
morgan
said
right
now
you
need
a
meal
and
a
bath
your
wife
s
in
terrible
shape
i
know
jones
said
dejectedly
morgan
filled
the
fire
box
with
wood
again
then
started
supper
and
set
the
table
when
the
meal
was
ready
he
told
jones
to
wash
up
and
going
into
the
front
room
woke
the
girl
he
said
i
ve
got
some
supper
ready
she
rubbed
her
eyes
and
stretched
then
sat
up
her
hands
going
to
her
hair
i
m
a
mess
she
said
and
suddenly
she
was
alarmed
who
are
you
how
did
we
get
here
i
m
dan
morgan
this
is
the
rafter
m
you
fell
down
in
front
of
the
house
and
i
carried
you
in
i
gave
you
a
drink
and
then
you
went
to
sleep
oh
she
stared
at
him
her
eyes
wide
as
she
thought
about
what
he
had
said
then
she
murmured
you
re
very
kind
mr
morgan
do
you
take
in
all
the
strays
who
come
by
i
do
n
t
have
many
strays
coming
to
my
front
door
he
said
think
you
can
walk
to
the
table
of
course
she
got
to
her
feet
staggered
and
almost
fell
he
caught
her
by
an
arm
and
helped
her
into
the
kitchen
she
sat
down
at
the
table
shaking
her
head
i
m
sorry
mr
morgan
i
m
usually
a
very
strong
woman
but
i
m
awfully
tired
and
hungry
he
said
start
in
it
s
not
much
of
a
meal
but
it
s
what
i
eat
not
much
of
a
meal
the
girl
cried
mr
morgan
it
s
the
best
looking
food
i
ever
saw
he
told
himself
he
had
never
seen
two
people
eat
so
much
when
they
were
finally
satisfied
jones
said
i
think
he
s
going
to
give
us
work
the
grateful
way
she
looked
at
morgan
made
him
ashamed
of
himself
when
he
saw
the
expression
in
her
eyes
he
knew
he
could
n
t
send
them
on
she
said
i
guess
the
lord
looks
out
for
fools
drunkards
and
innocents
morgan
laughed
which
are
you
we
re
not
drunkards
she
said
that
s
all
i
m
sure
of
she
helped
him
with
the
dishes
then
he
brought
more
water
in
from
the
spring
before
it
got
dark
he
carried
the
tub
from
the
back
of
the
house
where
it
hung
from
a
nail
in
the
wall
he
said
you
ll
feel
a
lot
better
after
you
have
a
bath
your
feet
are
in
bad
shape
mrs
jones
you
ll
have
to
go
to
town
to
see
the
doc
no
she
ll
be
all
right
jones
said
quickly
i
mean
we
do
n
t
have
any
way
to
get
there
and
we
ca
n
t
expect
you
to
quit
work
just
to
take
us
to
town
we
ll
see
morgan
said
could
you
find
me
a
needle
and
thread
the
girl
asked
my
dress
needs
some
work
on
it
he
nodded
and
going
into
the
bedroom
brought
a
needle
thread
and
scissors
he
said
i
m
going
to
bed
he
nodded
at
the
door
in
front
of
him
that
s
my
spare
bedroom
the
bed
is
n
t
made
but
you
ll
find
plenty
of
blankets
there
you
re
awfully
kind
the
girl
said
we
ll

jones
followed

into
the
front
room
closing
the
door
behind
him
he
said

and
morgan
said

jones

to

they
were
a
pair
of
lost
whipped
kids
morgan
thought
as
he
went
to
bed
gavin
paused
wearily
you
ca
n
t
stay
here
with
me
it
s
late
and
you
said
they
d
be
here
by
dawn
you
ca
n
t
make
me
go
gavin
sank
down
again
into
his
chair
and
began
to
rock
he
was
thinking
of
rittenhouse
and
how
he
had
left
him
there
to
rock
to
death
on
the
porch
of
the
splendide
it
was
the
only
thing
in
his
life
for
which
he
felt
guilt
beneath
his
black
shirt
his
frail
shoulders
shook
and
croaks
of
pain
broke
from
his
throat
the
stored
pain
shattering
free
in
slow
gasps
terrible
to
see
clayton
tried
to
call
back
the
face
of
the
man
he
had
known
against
that
other
man
he
could
rally
his
anger
against
this
bent
man
in
the
chair
he
was
powerless
gavin
s
lips
moved
so
that
clayton
had
to
stoop
to
catch
the
words
do
you
remember
big
charlie
he
whispered
he
stuck
with
me
all
these
years
just
a
half
breed
pache
never
said
much
never
meant
anythin
to
me
but
he
stuck
with
me
he
got
into
a
fight
with
tom
english
your
brother
s
son
it
was
a
fair
fight
the
boy
provoked
it
big
charlie
told
me
so
i
believed
him
they

charlie
dumped
his
body
in
my
rose
garden
two
nights

my
men
they

left
me
just
cleared
out
i
did
n
t
understand
why
clay
they
just
all
cleared
out
i
treated
them
fair
he
wiped
his
lips
with
a
sleeve
then
stared
at
clayton
in
a
childish
kind
of
wonder
do
you
mean
he
asked
almost
shyly
you
want
me
to
go
with
you
wherever
you
re
goin
yes
you
do
n
t
hate
me
any
more
clayton
choked
shook
his
head
murmuring
no
come
here
the
old
man
beckoned
with
one
finger
and
clayton
went
forward
to
him
gavin
slipped
his
arms
around
his
chest
and
hugged
him
fiercely
all
my
life
he
said
i
tried
i
tried
i
saw
you
driftin
away
but
i
tried
and
you

much

n
t

from
me
again
he
closed
his
eyes
ashamed
of
his
tears
i
ll
go
clay
clayton
freed
himself
from
the
embrace
and
stepped
back
the
eyes
followed
him
fearfully
the
horses
there
is
n
t
much
time
i
ll
saddle
the
horses
and
bring
them
round
you
get
ready
he
burst
from
the
hot
confinement
of
the
room
into
the
cold
night
air
gavin
s
stallion
was
in
the
barn
and
he
tightened
the
cinches
over
the
saddle
blanket
working
by
touch
in
the
darkness
comforting
the
animal
with
easy
words
when
he
had
finished
he
led
him
and
the
mare
to
the
porch
the
stallion
had
smelled
the
mare
coming
into
heat
and
began
to
paw
the
turf
shaking
his
head
clayton
looped
the
reins
in
a
knot
over
the
veranda
post
and
patted
the
warm
flesh
of
his
neck
the
mare
had
backed
away
you
take
it
easy
boy
clayton
whispered
she
does
n
t
want
you
now
you
take
it
easy
your
time
will
come
gavin
stood
on
the
porch
a
thin
figure
he
had
taken
a
carbine
down
from
the
wall
and
it
trailed
from
his
hand
the
stock
bumping
on
the
wood
floor
clayton
called
to
him
and
he
came
slowly
down
the
steps
clay
he
said
where
are
we
goin
to
a
ranch
in
the
valley
there
s
someone
there
i
have
to
see
we
may
take
her
with
us
to
california
i
do
n
t
know
yet
it
s
crazy
i
have
to
think
about
it
but
california
is
where
we
re
goin
california
gavin
began
to
nod
that
s
a
new
land
a
man
could
make
a
mark
there
two
men
together
like
us
we
could
do
somethin
fine
out
there
maybe
find
a
place
where
no
one
s
ever
been
start
out
fresh
the
two
of
us
like
nothin
had
ever
happened
yes
like
a
father
and
son
i
made
you
what
you

gavin
whispered
i
made
you
so
you
could
stand
up
i
made
you
a
man
yes
gavin
you
did
he
approached
the
horse
and
laid
a
hand
on
the
stallion
s
quivering
neck
help
me
up
clay
help
me
up
i
feel
kind
of
stiff
clayton
lifted
him
gently
into
the
saddle
like
a
child
i
hate
to
leave
my
garden
gavin
said
they
ll
trample
it
down
i
loved
my
garden
it
will
grow
again
in
california
i
loved
this
valley
he
whispered
huskily
lived
alone
here
for
three
years
before
any
man
came
lived
alone
by
the
river
it
was
nice
then
so
peaceful
and
quiet
there
was
no
one
but
me
i
do
n
t
want
to
leave
it
clayton
swung
into
the
saddle
and
whacked
the
stallion
s
rump
the
two
horses
broke
from
the
yard
from
the
circle
of
light
cast
by
the
lamp
still
burning
in
the
house
into
the
darkness
thirty
five
they
rode
at
a
measured
pace
through
the
valley
dawn
would
come
soon
and
the
night
was
at
its
coldest
the
moon
had
sunk
below
the
black
crest
of
the
mountains
and
the
land
seen
through
eyes
that
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
absence
of
light
looked
primeval
as
if
no
man
had
ever
trespassed
before
it
looked
as
gavin
had
first
seen
it
years
ago
on
those
nights
when
he
slept
alone
by
his
campfire
and
waked
suddenly
to
the
hoot
of
an
owl
or
the
rustle
of
a
blade
of
grass
in
the
moon
s
wind
a
savage
land
untenanted
and
brooding
too
strong
to
be
broken
by
the
will
of
men
gavin
sighed
bitterly
in
that
inert
landscape
the
caravan
of
his
desires
passed
before
his
mind
he
saw
them
ambushed
strewn
in
the
postures
of
the
broken
and
the
dying
in
vain
his
mind
groped
to
reassemble
the
bones
of
the
relationships
he
had
sought
so
desperately
but
they
would
not
come
to
life
the
silence
oppressed
him
made
him
bend
low
over
the
horse
s
neck
as
if
to
hide
from
a
wind
that
had
begun
to
blow
far
away
and
was
twisting
slowly
through
the
darkness
in
its
slow
search
they
passed
ranches
that
were
framed
dark
gray
against
the
black
hills
then
at
last
the
darkness
began
to
dissolve
a
bold
line
of
violet
broke
loose
from
the
high
ridge
of
the
mountains
followed
by
feathers
of
red
that
swept
the
last
stars
from
the
sky
the
wan
light
spread
over
the
ground
and
the
valley
revealed
in
the
first
glimmer
the
contours
of
trees
and
fences
and
palely
shadowed
gullies
they
had
been
seen
as
soon
as
they
left
the
ranch
picked
out
of
the
darkness
by
the
weary
though
watchful
eyes
of
two
men
posted
a
few
hundred
yards
away
in
the
windless
shelter
of
the
trees
the
two
men
whipped
their
horses
into
town
and
flung
themselves
up
the
steps
of
the
saloon
crying
their
intelligence
the
men
in
pettigrew
s
were
tired
from
a
night
s
drinking
their
faces
red
and
baggy
but
the
liquor
had
flushed
their
courage
they
greeted
the
news
angrily
as
though
they
had
been
cheated
of
purpose
lester
heard
their
muttering
saw
their
eyes
reveal
their
desire
he
worked
his
tongue
round
and
round
in
the
hollow
of
his
cheek
and
his
voice
came
out
of
his
throat
dry
and
cracked
he
s
leavin
that
s
what
you
wanted
is
n
t
it
clayton
is
with
him
takin
him
out
of
the
valley
you
ca
n
t
keep
out
of
this
purvis
snarled
he
s
not
your
brother
he
s
gavin
s
son
you
see
he
lied
to
us
when
he
said
he
was
leavin
alone
joe
purvis
was
thinking
back
many
years
first
he
thought
of
the
time
he
had
ridden
to
gavin
and
told
him
how
his
cattle
were
being
rustled
at
the
far
end
of
the
valley
he
remembered
gavin
s
smirk
his
own
cringing
feeling
his
impotence
then
he
thought
of
a
time
when
clayton
s
horse
had
fallen
lame
in
the
gap
his
wife
had
said
to
him
nellie
is
in
love
with
clayton
roy
he
would
n
t
even
dance
with
her
at
gavin
s
party
he
treats
her
like
she
was
dirt
and
you
stand
by
like
a
fool
and
let
him
do
it
he
remembered
clayton
s
mocking
smile
in
the
saloon
when
he
had
asked
him
what
he
would
do
if
they
brought
their
cattle
to
water
it
was
the
night
clayton
had
tricked
them
in
the
poker
game
you
re
gavin
s
son
joe
purvis
had
said
he
turned
to
lester
you
brought
him
back
to
this
valley
thinkin
he
would
help
you
find
your
boy
he
meant
to
help
gavin
all
the
time
he
made
a
fool
of
you
lester
he
swung
round
to
the
other
men
we
can
catch
him
easy
there
are
plenty
of
fresh
horses
halfway
at
my
place
if
we
let
them
go
they
wo
n
t
stay
away
they
ll
find
men
to
ride
with
them
and
they
ll
be
back
there
s
only
one
way
they
can
get
out
now
and
that
s
through
the
gap
if
we
ride
hard
we
can
take
them
lester
s
hand
fluttered
to
cabot
s
shoulder
the
boy
jerked
away
he
killed
tom
do
you
understand
that
cabot
turned
back
to
the
men
and
he
was
drunk
with
the
thing
they
would
do
wild
to
break
from
the
cloying
warmth
of
the
saloon
into
the
cold
of
the
ebbing
night
he
fled
through
the
door
and
down
the
steps
running
and
the
men
grunted
and
followed
pushing
lester
to
one
side
where
he
backed
against
the
wall
with
the
sleeve
of
his
jacket
raised
before
his
eyes
to
shut
out
the
light
purvis
and
silas
pettigrew
were
the
last
to
leave
they
mounted
up
and
rode
slowly
behind
the
others
at
a
safe
distance
thirty
six
in
the
cold
dawn
the
mist
swirled
low
to
the
ground
then
rose
with
a
gust
of
sudden
wind
to
leave
the
valley
clear
the
clouds
parted
and
hard
gashes
of
sunlight
swooped
down
to
stain
the
earth
with
streaks
of
white
and
gold
light
so
that
the
shadows
of
the
running
horses
flowed
like
dark
streams
over
the
dazzling
snow
when
they
turned
in
the
saddle
they
could
see
the
men
behind
them
strung
out
on
the
prairie
in
a
flat
black
line
the
wind
of
their
running
was
cold
and
wild
the
horses
were
lathered
and
their
manes
streamed
like
stiff
black
pennants
in
the
wind
the
mare
began
to
tire
and
clayton
felt
the
spray
of
snow
from
the
hoofs
of
gavin
s
stallion
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
thin
dotting
of
pursuers
they
neither
gained
nor
fell
back
he
rode
low
on
the
mare
s
neck
ahead
of
him
gavin
turned
slightly
off
the
trail
and
pointed
for
the
gap
no
more
than
a
mile
away
gavin
s
face
was
bloodless
with
excitement
he
did
not
look
back
he
could
feel
more
than
hear
the
staccato
beat
of
hoofs
that
fanned
out
across
the
prairie
to
the
north
he
knew
who
was
riding
after
him
the
men
he
had
known
all
his
life
the
men
who
had
worked
for
him
sworn
their
loyalty
to
him
now
they
were
riding
to
kill
him
and
he
was
fleeing
running
fleeing
his
death
and
his
life
at
the
same
time
the
land
over
which
he
sped
was
the
land
he
had
created
and
lived
in
his
valley
with
every
leaping
stride
of
the
horse
beneath
him
he
crossed
one
more
patch
of
earth
that
had
been
his
that
he
would
never
see
again
the
gap
looming
before
him
the
place
where
he
had
confronted
jack
english
on
that
day
so
many
years
ago
was
his
exit
from
all
that
had
meaning
to
him
california
is
too
far
he
thought
he
would
never
reach
california
he
was
too
old
when
he
passed
up
and
through
the
corridor
of
pines
that
lined
the
trail
he
could
see
ahead
he
was
passing
from
life
the
sentry
was
not
dead
he
was
in
fact
showing
signs
of
reviving
he
had
been
carrying
an
enfield
rifle
and
a
holstered
navy
cap
and
ball
pistol
a
bayonet
hung
in
a
belt
scabbard
he
was
partially
uniformed
in
a
cavalry
tunic
and
hat
mike
stripped
these
from
him
and
donned
them
he
and
dean
tied
and
gagged
the
man
using
his
belt
and
shirt
for
the
purpose
they
dragged
him
inside
the
building
fiske
joined
them
unsteady
on
his
feet
julia
seeing
the
bandage
rushed
to
him
you
are
hurt
she
breathed
i
never
felt
better
in
my
life
fiske
blustered
he
turned
to
susan
and
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
thank
you
my
dear
he
said
you
are
very
brave
mike
silenced
them
we
ll
talk
later
first
we
ve
got
to
get
out
of
here
we
ll
grab
horses
dean
said
the
main
bunch
is
outside
but
there
are
some
over
there
inside
the
wall
mike
debated
it
trying
to
decide
whether
fiske
was
strong
enough
to
ride
but
it
at
least
offered
him
a
chance
for
living
he
had
none
here
and
for
the
sake
of
julia
and
susan
it
had
to
be
tried
the
guerrilla
bivouac
remained
silent
light
showed
in
the
orderly
room
across
the
parade
ground
someone
evidently
was
on
duty
there
no
doubt
there
would
be
men
guarding
the
horses
about
a
dozen
animals
were
held
inside
the
stockade
as
best
mike
could
make
out
in
the
moonlight
evidently
this
was
a
precaution
so
that
mounts
would
be
available
in
an
emergency
he
handed
the
guard
s
rifle
to
fiske
dean
and
myself
will
try
to
cut
out
horses
to
ride
he
said
we
ll
stampede
the
rest
you
stay
with
the
ladies
all
of
you
be
ready
to
ride
hell
for
leather
he
added
if
this
does
n
t
work
out
the
three
of
you
barricade
yourself
in
the
house
and
talk
terms
with
them
he
handed
the
bayonet
to
dean
and
kept
the
pistol
susan
halted
dean
and
kissed
him
she
clung
to
him
talking
to
him
and
dabbing
at
her
eyes
mike
turned
away
he
was
thinking
that
the
way
she
had
responded
to
his
own
kiss
had
n
t
meant
what
he
had
believed
it
had
he
felt
unutterably
weary
dean
turned
from
susan
and
took
julia
fortune
in
his
arms
he
kissed
her
also
and
with
deep
tenderness
she
too
began
to
weep
he
released
her
and
joined
mike
all
right
he
said
mike
only
said
later
be
careful
mclish
susan
said
fiercely
the
way
you
were
careful
he
snorted
running
around
in
the
moonlight
almost
naked
and
slugging
a
man
with
a
rock
he
kept
going
he
wanted
no
more
sentimental
scenes
with
her
he
might
say
or
do
something
foolish
something
all
of
them
would
regret
he
might
tell
her
how
sorry
a
spectacle
she
was
making
of
herself
pretending
to
be
blind
to
the
way
julia
fortune
had
taken
dean
s
affections
from
her
and
using
him
mike
mclish
as
a
sop
to
her
pride
he
handed
the
bayonet
to
dean
and
kept
the
pistol
stay
well
back
of
me
he
said
i
m
going
to
walk
up
to
the
horses
bold
as
brass
pretending
i
m
one
of
the
guerrillas
there
s
bound
to
be
someone
on
guard
but
the
hat
might
fool
them
long
enough
for
me
to
get
close
holding
the
pistol
concealed
he
walked
to
the
rear
wall
of
the
stockade
it
was
pierced
by
a
wagon
gate
built
of
two
wings
one
wing
stood
open
mike
passed
through
it
and
moved
toward
the
dark
mass
of
horses
they
were
tethered
army
style
on
stable
lines
a
voice
spoke
near
at
hand
who
s
that
just
me
mike
said
is
that
you
bill
he
located
his
man
the
guard
stood
in
the
shadow
of
the
stockade
wall
just
out
of
reach
of
the
moonlight
mike
kept
walking
and
got
within
arm
s
reach
before
the
man
became
suspicious
and
straightened
from
his
lax
slouch
mike
struck
with
the
muzzle
of
the
pistol
but
the
luck
that
had
been
running
their
way
left
him
the
guard
instinctively
parried
the
blow
with
his
rifle
he
tried
to
veer
the
rifle
around
to
fire
into
mike
s
body
mike
off
balance
managed
to
bat
the
muzzle
away
a
moment
before
it
exploded
the
bullet
went
wide
mike
swung
the
pistol
in
a
savage
backlash
this
time
it
connected
solidly
on
the
man
s
temple
felling
him
the
explosion
of
the
rifle
had
crashed
against
the
walls
of
the
stockade
and
the
deep
echoes
were
still
rolling
in
the
hills
the
startled
horses
began
rearing
on
their
tethers
dean
came
rushing
up
are
you
hit
he
demanded
no
but
the
fat
s
in
the
fire
mike
said
there
s
no
chance
now
of
all
of
us
getting
away
you
ll
have
to
try
it
alone
the
sentry
s
saddled
horse
stood
picketed
nearby
having
been
kept
handy
in
case
of
need
mike
took
the
bayonet
from
dean
s
hand
and
slashed
the
picket
line
up
you
go
he
said
ride
dean
resisted
mike
s
attempt
to
push
him
toward
the
horse
why
not
you
he
protested
dammit
mike
said
frantically
you
re
lighter
than
me
it
s
our
only
chance
now
try
to
find
these
feds
the
rest
of
us
can
fort
up
in
the
house
and
hang
on
until
you
get
back
you
re
the
one
that
s
taking
the
big
chance
dean
still
hesitated
but
mike
lifted
him
almost
bodily
into
the
saddle
and
thrust
the
reins
in
his
hand
no
telling
how
good
this
horse
is
mike
panted
favor
him
and
save
something
in
case
you
hit
trouble
watch
out
for
apaches
when
it
comes
daylight
take
the
pistol
you
might
need
it
we
ll
still
have
the
rifle
and
i
might
be
able
to
round
up
some
more
i
ll
stampede
the
rest
of
these
horses
so
they
ca
n
t
chase
you
dean
leaned
from
the
saddle
and
gave
him
a
mighty
whack
on
the
back
mclish
he
said
as
he
kicked
the
horse
into
motion
i
d
be
a
mighty
sad
man
if
we
never
met
again
then
he
was
on
his
way
at
a
gallop
mike
ran
down
the
line
slashing
picket
ropes
with
the
bayonet
he
lifted
a
screeching
war
whoop
that
touched
off
a
total
stampede
he
darted
inside
the
stockade
and
freed
the
horses
there
these
poured
through
the
gate
and
joined
the
flight
the
animals
thundered
away
into
the
moonlight
heading
for
the
ridges
the
guerrillas
were
swarming
from
their
bivouac
at
the
west
end
of
the
enclosure
paches
mike
yelled
they
re
stealin
the
stock
he
scuttled
in
shadow
along
the
east
wall
of
the
stockade
and
then
followed
the
south
wall
until
he
was
at
the
rear
of
the
two
frame
buildings
he
crouched
there
his
shout
had
been
taken
up
and
repeated
the
guerrillas
were
running
across
the
parade
ground
and
through
the
rear
gate
in
the
wake
of
the
departing
horses
all
were
carrying
guns
they
had
seized
up
but
they
were
half
clad
or
hardly
clad
at
all
durkin
and
calhoun
came
running
from
the
post
they
had
pistols
in
their
hands
they
bawled
questions
that
were
not
answered
in
the
uproar
they
followed
the
others
toward
the
east
gate
beyond
the
stockade
rifles
began
to
explode
as
some
of
the
guerrillas
fired
at
shadows
that
they
imagined
were
apaches
mike
made
a
dash
to
the
rear
of
the
frame
buildings
he
crawled
beneath
the
two
supply
wagons
which
stood
between
the
buildings
and
peered
around
a
corner
the
area
was
deserted
a
man
was
standing
in
the
open
door
of
the
lighted
orderly
room
a
few
yards
to
mike
s
left
but
he
too
suddenly
made
up
his
mind
and
went
racing
to
join
the
confused
activity
at
the
east
end
of
the
stockade
mike
crawled
to
the
door
and
peered
in
the
orderly
room
seemed
to
be
deserted
a
lantern
hung
from
a
peg
giving
light
ducking
inside
he
found
that
three
rifles
were
stacked
in
a
corner
a
brace
of
pistols
holstered
on
belts
hung
from
a
peg
along
with
ammunition
pouches
an
ammunition
case
stood
open
containing
canisters
which
contained
powder
cartridges
mike
seized
a
blanket
from
a
pallet
in
a
corner
spread
it
on
the
floor
and
used
it
to
form
a
bag
in
which
he
placed
his
booty
shouldering
the
load
he
peered
from
the
door
his
looting
of
the
orderly
room
had
taken
only
a
minute
or
two
and
the
vicinity
was
still
clear
of
guerrillas
he
looked
at
the
looming
hoods
of
the
supply
wagons
struck
by
a
new
inspiration
he
set
his
bundle
down
snatching
the
lantern
from
its
peg
he
shattered
its
globe
with
a
blow
against
a
post
he
picked
up
the
powder
canister
and
ran
out
bursting
paper
cartridges
he
scattered
powder
beneath
the
nearest
wagon
and
dumped
the
contents
of
the
canister
upon
it
he
shouldered
the
blanket
again
backed
off
and
tossed
the
lantern
with
its
open
wick
beneath
the
wagon
he
turned
and
raced
across
the
parade
ground
toward
the
rock
house
powder
flame
gushed
beneath
the
wagon
the
stockade
was
brilliantly
lighted
and
the
guerrillas
sighted
him
they
realized
the
truth
bullets
began
to
snap
past
him
one
struck
the
muzzle
of
one
of
the
rifles
that
projected
from
the
shoulder
pack
its
force
spun
him
around
but
he
recovered
and
got
into
stride
again
a
bullet
tore
the
earth
from
beneath
his
foot
when
he
was
a
stride
or
two
from
safety
another
struck
him
heavily
in
the
thigh
and
he
went
down
guerrillas
were
racing
toward
him
susan
and
julia
came
from
the
door
and
dragged
him
with
them
the
three
of
them
floundered
through
the
door
into
the
interior
and
fell
in
a
heap
susan
bounced
to
her
feet
and
slammed
the
door
she
crouched
aside
as
bullets
beat
at
the
portal
chewing
into
the
planks
some
tore
entirely
through
the
whipsawed
post
oak
the
iron
hinges
held
but
the
planks
were
in
danger
of
being
torn
from
the
crossbars
mike
rolled
to
susan
grasped
her
around
the
knees
dragging
her
off
her
feet
he
hovered
over
her
to
shield
her
for
spent
bullets
were
thudding
against
the
rear
walls
he
peered
from
a
loophole
guerrillas
were
only
a
dozen
yards
away
charging
the
house
mike
snatched
a
pistol
from
the
heap
of
scattered
booty
and
fired
he
dropped
a
man
with
the
first
bullet
at
the
same
moment
wheeler
fiske
fired
the
rifle
mike
had
given
him
and
another
guerrilla
was
hit
that
halted
the
rush
the
guerrillas
scattered
for
cover
the
wagons
were
burning
fiercely
the
mudwagon
had
caught
fire
also
the
blaze
was
spreading
to
the
frame
buildings
the
guerrillas
realized
they
faced
a
new
problem
gawdamighty
one
screeched
there
goes
our
grub
an
ammunition
get
a
bucket
line
going
calhoun
shouted
hurry
hurry
the
guerrillas
began
a
frantic
search
for
pails
in
which
to
bring
water
from
the
spring
but
what
few
containers
they
found
were
inadequate
many
of
them
in
increasing
panic
came
running
with
water
in
their
hats
in
a
ludicrous
effort
both
buildings
were
in
flames
the
heat
drove
the
guerrillas
back
the
roof
of
the
command
post
began
to
buckle
drag
the
wagons
to
the
spring
lew
durkin
yelled
run
em
right
into
the
spring
hustle
one
of
the
wagons
erupted
a
massive
pillar
of
flame
a
sizable
supply
of
powder
had
been
touched
off
the
wagons
and
the
coach
were
beyond
saving
and
so
were
the
buildings
the
glow
of
the
fire
reached
through
the
openings
in
the
windows
giving
light
enough
to
examine
mike
s
wound
the
bullet
had
torn
through
the
flesh
just
above
the
knee
inflicting
an
ugly
gash
that
was
forming
a
pool
of
blood
on
the
floor
but
it
had
missed
the
bone
and
had
passed
on
through
susan
and
julia
ripped
strips
from
their
clothing
and
bound
the
injury
mike
tested
the
leg
and
found
that
he
was
able
to
hobble
around
on
it
so
it
was
n
t
the
earthquake
that
made
him
return
to
his
village
no
now
dammit
i
do
n
t
want
to
go
into
any
more
explanations
here
comes
jason
keep
this
to
yourself
reverend
jason
looking
worried
hurried
toward
us
anything
wrong
cap
n
the
men
seem
to
think
so
dirion
found
a
large
war
party
south
of
us
they
ll
probably
attack
at
dawn
montero
said
he
brushed
past
the
clergyman
and
walked
into
the
center
of
the
camp
using
his
hands
as
a
trumpet
he
shouted
fort
up
fort
up
there
s
a
large
war
party
on
their
way
for
a
second
engages
cooks
voyageurs
appeared
struck
dumb
then
little
billy
began
shouting
orders
to
round
up
the
ponies
and
fill
the
water
buckets
and
for
the
cooks
to
hurry
up
with
the
meal
they
all
flew
into
action
that
was
a
terrible
thing
to
do
i
said
to
oso
the
aricaras
treated
us
like
friends
and
here
all
the
time
you
knew
the
sioux
would
be
using
our
rifles
on
them
god
what
a
world
you
people
live
in
oso
gave
me
an
unruffled
look
old
knife
s
got
the
largest
war
party
ever
seen
on
the
river
he
said
calmly
what
would
you
have
done
in
montero
s
moccasins
let
old
knife
come
up
and
kill
you
and
your
people
or
would
you
steer
him
on
someone
else
he
shook
his
head
mr
manuel
did
that
in
the
war
that
s
why
the
british
never
got
the
tribes
to
fight
for
the
king
mr
manuel
whispered
in
the
ears
of
the
sioux
that
the
cheyennes
were
comin
to
raid
em
for
their
horses
then
he
went
on
to
the
cheyennes
and
told
them
that
the
sioux
was
goin
to
move
up
he
did
that
with
all
the
nations
hell
they
were
fightin
each
other
so
hard
they
had
no
time
for
anyone
else
the
war
department
wrote
mr
manuel
a
letter
and
said
he
was
a
hero
i
saw
that
letter
he
carried
it
in
a
little
wallet
made
of
fish
skin
but
that
was
war
i
said
there
s
no
war
on
now
you
re
wrong
matt
in
this
country
there
s
a
war
on
every
time
the
grass
turns
green
first
it
was
the
nations
against
themselves
then
it
was
them
against
the
whites
and
it
s
goin
to
go
on
like
this
year
after
year
until
the
white
people
take
over
this
land
i
remember
being
told
it
would
happen
so
fast
people
would
think
it
took
place
overnight
that
s
why
this
company
s
important
once
we
get
over
the
mountains
others
will
come
along
that
s
why
the
trust
do
n
t
want
us
to
make
it
that
bastard
chambers
old
knife
s
not
the
only
chief
he
ll
get
to
do
his
dirty
work
before
we
get
through
he
ll
have
the
blackfeet
hankerin
for
our
hair
and
our
goods
well
talkin
ai
n
t
goin
to
help
let
s
fort
up
as
i
dug
in
behind
one
of
the
bales
we
were
using
as
protection
i
grudgingly
found
myself
agreeing
with
oso
s
logic
especially
when
i
imagined
what
would
have
happened
to
missy
if
old
knife
s
large
party
of
screeching
warriors
had
overrun
our
company
for
unlike
the
sioux
and
the
crows
the
aricaras
are
not
great
horsemen
nor
are
they
aggressive
like
the
savage
blackfeet
more
of
an
agricultural
nation
they
have
relied
on
their
warriors
only
for
defense
and
for
survival
in
the
endless
wars
of
the
plains
still
i
was
disgusted
with
myself
for
agreeing
with
montero
s
methods
surprisingly
he
had
told
the
others
what
he
had
done
in
the
brief
moment
i
had
to
talk
to
them
before
i
took
my
post
on
the
ring
of
defenses
i
indicated
i
was
sickened
by
the
methods
men
employed
to
live
and
trade
on
the
river
i
think
montero
did
right
amy
said
firmly
let
the
savages
kill
each
other
what
do
we
care
reverend
jason
was
understandably
bitter
it
was
a
terrible
thing
to
do
those
little
children
but
oso
replied
calmly
trouble
ai
n
t
easy
to
dodge
out
in
this
country
rev
rend
attack
gray
eyes
attacked
our
camp
just
as
the
first
pink
threads
stitched
together
the
hills
and
the
sky
our
camp
was
in
the
center
of
a
wide
valley
montero
had
set
up
a
strong
position
using
every
bale
and
box
we
had
in
addition
to
barricades
of
logs
and
brush
he
had
ordered
the
ponies
brought
inside
the
fortified
circle
and
had
assigned
pierre
and
a
band
of
picked
engages
the
job
of
trying
to
keep
them
steady
under
fire
the
pony
herd
was
the
one
flaw
in
our
defense
the
rees
undoubtedly
would
try
to
cut
down
as
many
of
the
animals
as
possible
wildly
bucking
horses
would
make
the
position
difficult
to
defend
against
charging
warriors
the
cooks
had
prepared
one
of
the
best
meals
we
d
had
in
a
long
time
and
on
montero
s
orders
had
baked
enough
bread
to
last
the
day
buckets
were
filled
the
herd
fed
and
watered
the
worst
part
had
been
the
waiting
although
we
did
n
t
expect
the
attack
before
dawn
the
long
cloudy
night
filled
with
the
sounds
of
the
industrious
insects
seemed
endless
coyotes
and
hunting
wolves
sounded
like
signaling
indian
scouts
the
whinny
of
a
restless
pony
made
one
s
skin
crawl
oso
slept
unconcernedly
his
rifle
cradled
in
his
arms
i
did
n
t
catch
a
wink
every
time
i
closed
my
eyes
i
saw
gray
eyes
rushing
at
me
with
a
knife
it
was
a
relief
when
they
finally
came
they
poured
through
the
opening
in
the
valley
then
spread
out
in
a
long
line
to
come
at
us
brandishing
their
lances
and
filling
the
morning
with
their
spine
chilling
scalp
cry
oso
montero
called
i
ll
get
gray
eyes
that
ll
be
a
pleasure
to
see
the
big
black
murmured
as
he
stared
down
the
barrel
of
his
rifle
hold
your
fire
montero
was
shouting
wait
until
my
shot
i
ll
shoot
the
first
man
who
does
n
t
i
could
see
them
in
my
sights
they
were
about
a
mile
off
under
me
the
ground
quivered
slightly
at
first
they
were
only
feathers
and
dark
indistinguishable
faces
and
bodies
hunched
over
their
horses
heads
gradually
they
emerged
as
men
gray
eyes
was
in
the
lead
his
face
was
split
by
a
vermilion
streak
his
eyes
were
pools
of
white
jagged
red
and
black
medicine
symbols
covered
his
chest
he
was
naked
except
for
a
clout
next
to
him
was
a
young
boy
i
was
sure
had
sat
near
me
at
one
of
the
trading
sessions
his
mouth
was
open
his
neck
corded
with
the
strain
of
his
screams
i
found
his
chest
in
my
sights
it
had
a
red
circle
the
circle
came
nearer
and
nearer
my
god
how
long
is
he
going
to
wait
i
thought
montero
s
rifle
cracked
at
first
i
thought
he
had
missed
gray
eyes
remained
erect
the
feathered
lance
was
still
above
his
head
as
he
started
to
slump
over
another
warrior
swung
him
onto
his
horse
i
squeezed
the
trigger
at
the
last
second
i
dropped
my
sights
from
the
bare
chest
and
bright
red
circle
to
the
chest
of
his
pony
i
saw
the
pony
fall
like
a
stone
and
the
young
warrior
flew
over
its
head
bouncing
like
a
rubber
ball
he
started
to
run
but
oso
s
shot
caught
him
on
the
wing
he
jerked
once
in
the
grass
and
lay
still
if
you
re
goin
to
kill
em
kill
em
oso
growled
what
else
he
said
was
lost
in
the
rattle
of
gunfire
on
all
sides
the
aricaras
broke
under
the
devastating
fire
wheeled
and
retreated
lead
up
lead
up
they
ll
be
back
montero
was
shouting
far
up
the
valley
i
could
see
the
rees
circling
and
reorganizing
out
in
front
of
our
walls
the
grass
was
covered
with
dead
and
dying
men
war
shields
lances
blankets
and
wounded
and
dead
horses
the
morning
air
was
filled
with
the
sweetish
odor
of
new
spilled
blood
the
acrid
stench
of
frightened
horses
and
the
bitterness
of
burned
powder
a
horse
screamed
as
it
twisted
from
side
to
side
in
a
frenzy
a
rifle
cracked
the
square
head
fell
over
one
of
the
warriors
suddenly
leaped
to
his
feet
and
began
running
across
the
valley
to
the
trees
that
lined
the
small
creek
his
legs
pumped
furiously
his
long
black
hair
streamed
out
behind
him
there
was
a
ragged
volley
he
was
dead
before
he
hit
the
ground
for
christ
s
sake
do
n
t
waste
your
powder
on
one
of
em
montero
shouted
furiously
wait
for
the
charge
the
charge
i
tell
you
the
sharp
cries
at
the
end
of
the
valley
were
faint
they
grew
louder
as
the
indians
charged
again
i
could
see
their
faces
glistening
with
sweat
and
bear
grease
their
mouths
open
shouting
their
spine
chilling
cries
gray
eyes
is
back
montero
said
the
war
captain
had
been
badly
wounded
and
was
fighting
to
hold
his
seat
i
could
see
the
blood
running
down
his
chest
he
was
riding
between
two
warriors
who
held
him
erect
when
he
started
to
slump
i
forgot
to
aim
in
my
sights
i
watched
him
looming
bigger
and
bigger
montero
s
shot
had
caught
him
high
in
the
chest
there
was
no
doubt
he
was
dying
again
we
waited
for
montero
this
time
he
delayed
so
long
that
some
of
the
engages
shouted
frantically
but
they
held
their
fire
the
horses
were
only
several
lengths
away
when
he
fired
the
bullet
flung
gray
eyes
from
his
horse
our
rolling
volley
swept
most
of
the
other
riders
from
their
mounts
but
a
few
reached
our
wall
i
heard
the
whir
of
an
ax
and
a
canadian
s
face
burst
apart
in
a
bloody
spray
i
saw
little
billy
rise
and
fire
almost
point
blank
and
an
indian
s
face
became
shattered
flesh
and
bone
a
second
leaped
from
his
horse
to
the
top
of
the
bale
firing
four
arrows
in
such
rapid
succession
it
did
n
t
seem
possible
they
were
in
flight
men
screamed
oso
reached
up
jerked
the
buck
from
the
bale
and
snapped
his
neck
other
indians
were
running
at
the
ponies
shrilling
and
waving
blankets
reverend
jason
got
one
the
canadians
the
others
i
saw
the
clergyman
kneel
for
a
moment
by
the
twitching
body
of
the
man
he
had
shot
then
run
back
to
his
position
the
ponies
were
almost
uncontrollable
the
pall
of
dust
they
raised
made
it
difficult
to
see
when
the
aricaras
charged
again
this
time
more
of
them
hurdled
the
barrier
a
small
indian
dived
at
montero
who
caught
him
with
a
swift
upward
stroke
of
his
rifle
butt
it
sounded
like
a
man
kicking
a
melon
above
me
a
dark
rider
was
whipping
his
pony
with
a
quirt
in
an
attempt
to
hurdle
the
bales
although
my
shot
killed
his
horse
he
rolled
off
the
bale
on
top
of
me
i
could
smell
woodsmoke
grease
and
oil
his
eyes
were
dark
fluid
fearful
and
he
gave
a
sigh
as
my
knife
went
in
coming
over
the
wall
he
had
seemed
like
a
hideous
devil
now
under
me
i
could
see
him
for
what
he
really
was
a
boy
dressed
up
in
streaks
of
paint
the
aricaras
made
one
last
desperate
charge
it
was
pitiful
to
see
the
thin
ranks
of
warriors
old
and
young
wheeling
and
twisting
their
ponies
frantically
from
side
to
side
only
to
be
tumbled
bleeding
from
their
saddles
by
the
relentless
slam
slam
of
the
cruelly
efficient
hawkinses
others
badly
wounded
gripped
hands
in
manes
knees
in
bellies
held
on
as
long
as
possible
and
then
weak
from
ghastly
wounds
slipped
sideways
slowly
almost
thoughtfully
to
be
broken
under
the
slashing
hoofs
some
gracefully
soared
from
the
backs
of
their
wounded
screaming
mounts
to
make
one
last
defiant
charge
before
the
lead
split
their
hearts
or
tore
their
guts
none
of
them
reached
our
walls
again
the
few
survivors
grudgingly
turned
away
in
the
distance
we
could
hear
the
drums
and
the
wail
of
the
death
song
she
was
carrying
a
quirt
and
she
started
to
raise
it
then
let
it
fall
again
and
dangle
from
her
wrist
i
saw
your
fire
she
said
speaking
slowly
making
an
effort
to
control
her
anger
you
could
burn
down
this
whole
mountainside
with
a
fire
that
size
it
would
n
t
matter
to
a
fool
like
you
it
would
to
me
all
right
wilson
said
quickly
the
fire
s
too
big
and
i
appreciate
the
advice
he
was
losing
patience
again
an
hour
before
with
the
children
asleep
and
nothing
but
the
strange
darkness
he
would
have
appreciated
company
she
had
helped
him
change
his
mind
i
m
not
advising
you
she
said
i
m
telling
you
that
fire
s
too
big
let
it
burn
down
and
make
sure
it
s
out
when
you
leave
in
the
morning
he
was
taken
aback
it
took
him
a
long
time
to
compose
himself
there
s
some
mistake
he
said
finally
you
re
right
about
the
fire
it
s
bigger
than
it
has
to
be
though
i
do
n
t
see
where
it
s
doing
any
harm
but
you
re
wrong
about
the
rest
of
it
i
m
not
leaving
in
the
morning
why
should
i
i
own
the
place
she
showed
her
surprise
by
tightening
the
reins
and
moving
the
gelding
around
so
that
she
could
get
a
better
look
at
his
face
it
did
n
t
seem
to
tell
her
anything
she
glanced
around
the
clearing
taking
in
the
wagon
and
the
load
of
supplies
and
trappings
scattered
over
the
ground
the
two
kids
the
whiteface
bull
that
was
chewing
its
cud
just
within
the
far
reaches
of
the
firelight
she
studied
it
for
a
long
time
then
she
turned
back
to
wilson
and
smiled
and
he
was
n
t
quite
sure
what
she
meant
by
it
you
own
this
place
she
said
and
her
tone
had
softened
until
it
was
almost
friendly
you
bought
it
from
a
man
in
st
louis
wilson
said
jake
carwood
maybe
you
know
him
the
girl
laughed
i
know
him
i
ought
to
my
father
ran
him
off
here
six
years
ago
wilson
did
n
t
say
anything
he
stood
watching
the
girl
wondering
what
was
coming
next
she
had
picked
up
the
quirt
and
was
twirling
it
around
her
wrist
and
smiling
at
him
carwood
did
n
t
tell
you
that
she
said
no
wilson
said
but
it
s
understandable
it
s
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
a
man
would
be
proud
of
and
it
does
n
t
make
any
difference
he
sold
me
a
clear
title
i
have
it
with
me
right
here
if
you
want
to
see
never
mind
she
said
sternly
it
would
n
t
matter
to
my
father
and
not
to
me
i
meant
what
i
said
about
that
fire
be
sure
it
s
out
when
you
leave
that
s
all
i
ll
let
you
go
back
to
doing
the
dishes
now
it
was
meant
to
insult
him
and
did
n
t
quite
succeed
he
took
the
reins
just
below
the
bit
and
held
them
firmly
and
it
was
his
turn
to
smile
now
i
do
n
t
mind
washing
dishes
now
and
then
he
said
pleasantly
it
does
n
t
hurt
it
might
hurt
you
though
somebody
might
mistake
you
for
a
woman
he
meant
to
say
more
but
he
never
got
the
chance
she
was
quick
she
brought
the
quirt
down
slashing
it
across
his
cheek
and
he
tried
to
step
back
she
swung
the
quirt
again
and
this
time
he
caught
her
wrist
and
pulled
her
out
of
the
saddle
she
came
down
against
him
and
he
tried
to
break
her
fall
he
grabbed
her
by
the
shoulders
and
went
down
on
one
knee
taking
her
weight
so
that
some
of
the
wind
was
driven
out
of
him
it
made
him
a
little
sick
and
he
let
go
of
her
he
got
up
slowly
and
she
was
already
on
her
feet
and
he
stood
facing
her
he
wiped
the
blood
from
his
cheek
i
ought
to
he
said
he
was
shaking
with
anger
his
breath
coming
in
long
painful
gasps
that
quirt
i
ought
to
use
it
on
you
where
it
would
do
the
most
good
if
you
were
a
man
she
is
n
t
mister
the
voice
came
from
behind
him
and
wilson
turned
the
fire
had
gone
down
and
the
man
was
only
a
shadow
against
the
trees
but
a
moment
later
he
brought
his
horse
forward
into
the
light
and
wilson
had
a
good
look
at
him
he
was
tall
and
dark
skinned
a
half
breed
wilson
thought
and
he
was
handsome
despite
the
long
thin
scar
that
slanted
across
his
cheek
she
s
not
a
man
mister
he
said
i
am
if
you
ve
got
any
ideas
he
raised
the
winchester
and
pointed
it
at
wilson
s
chest
put
the
rifle
down
joseph
the
girl
said
she
seemed
irritated
i
thought
i
told
you
to
stay
home
the
half
breed
eased
the
winchester
down
and
rested
it
across
his
lap
the
scar
looked
pure
white
in
the
half
darkness
his
eyes
were
black
and
deep
set
and
expressionless
you
should
n
t
be
riding
up
here
after
dark
judith
he
said
quietly
i
can
take
care
of
this
it
s
no
job
for
you
the
girl
tapped
the
quirt
impatiently
against
her
knee
and
glared
at
him
he
took
it
without
flinching
i
said
go
home
joseph
you
ve
got
no
business
up
here
the
half
breed
did
n
t
answer
this
time
but
the
scar
seemed
to
pull
hard
at
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
his
eyes
were
hurt
and
angry
it
made
wilson
wonder
he
watched
the
half
breed
as
he
turned
silently
they
could
hear
the
pony
s
feet
on
the
dry
leaves
for
a
while
then
the
sound
faded
out
wilson
brushed
the
dust
from
his
coat
who
was
that
he
asked
your
personal
guard
you
re
pretty
hard
on
him
he
works
for
my
father
the
girl
said
and
then
seemed
to
change
her
mind
he
s
a
friend
his
name
s
joseph
sanchez
is
there
anything
else
you
want
to
know
not
now
wilson
said
i
guess
i
ll
find
out
soon
enough
you
ve
got
blood
on
your
cheek
not
yours
mine
it
must
have
got
there
when
you
fell
against
me
she
wiped
it
off
with
the
sleeve
of
her
coat
i
ll
bet
that
s
as
close
as
you
ve
been
to
a
man
since
you
were
a
baby
wilson
said
he
saw
her
hand
start
to
work
down
the
leather
thong
toward
the
handle
of
the
quirt
and
he
grabbed
her
wrist
oh
no
he
said
and
he
was
without
humor
now
i
ve
had
enough
of
that
i
ve
had
enough
of
you
i
do
n
t
know
what
goes
on
around
here
and
i
do
n
t
care
i
do
n
t
know
what
makes
you
think
you
can
get
away
with
this
kind
of
business
and
i
do
n
t
care
about
that
either
you
took
me
by
surprise
but
i
ll
know
how
to
handle
you
next
time
she
brought
up
her
free
hand
to
hit
him
but
this
time
he
was
quicker
he
side
stepped
her
blow
and
she
fell
stumbling
against
the
gelding
she
finally
regained
her
balance
and
got
up
in
the
saddle
her
hat
had
come
off
and
fallen
behind
her
shoulders
held
by
the
string
and
he
could
see
her
face
more
clearly
than
he
had
at
any
time
before
he
had
forgotten
that
she
was
so
pretty
but
her
prettiness
was
what
he
had
noticed
first
and
all
the
other
things
had
come
afterward
cruelty
meanness
self
will
he
had
known
women
like
that
one
woman
in
particular
and
one
had
been
too
many
he
watched
the
girl
until
she
had
gone
into
the
trees
and
waited
until
he
could
n
t
hear
the
sound
of
her
horse
any
longer
then
went
up
to
where
the
children
were
sleeping
they
were
n
t
sleeping
of
course
but
they
thought
they
were
doing
him
a
favor
by
pretending
he
had
n
t
shown
up
too
well
in
their
eyes
letting
himself
be
browbeaten
by
a
woman
they
expected
greater
things
from
him
regardless
of
how
trying
the
circumstances
and
they
were
disappointed
and
determined
not
to
show
it
they
lay
a
little
too
stiffly
with
their
eyes
straining
to
stay
closed
go
to
sleep
he
said
both
of
you
there
s
better
things
to
do
than
listen
to
something
like
that
i
ll
be
down
at
the
creek
finishing
the
dishes
if
you
want
me
he
found
the
pan
where
he
had
dropped
it
and
carried
it
back
down
to
the
stream
the
coyote
was
calling
again
and
he
hoped
that
this
time
there
would
be
no
other
sounds
to
interrupt
it
not
tonight
at
any
rate
he
had
a
feeling
that
the
girl
meant
trouble
if
she
did
he
could
stand
it
better
in
the
light
he
scrubbed
absent
mindedly
at
the
pans
and
reflected
on
how
things
had
turned
out
that
afternoon
when
they
had
pulled
up
in
front
of
the
broken
down
ranch
house
his
hopes
had
been
high
already
some
of
the
pain
had
gone
from
amelia
s
death
not
all
of
it
there
would
still
be
plenty
of
moments
of
regret
and
sadness
and
guilty
relief
but
they
were
starting
a
new
life
and
they
had
almost
everything
they
needed
land
a
house
two
whiteface
bulls
three
horses
the
land
was
n
t
all
wilson
had
expected
of
it
six
hundred
and
forty
acres
the
old
man
back
in
st
louis
had
said
good
grass
good
water
well
the
grass
was
there
though
in
some
places
the
ground
was
too
steep
for
a
cow
to
get
to
it
the
water
was
there
so
much
of
it
that
it
spread
all
through
the
dead
orchard
and
there
was
a
house
livable
perhaps
but
badly
in
need
of
repairs
in
the
last
analysis
though
wilson
had
little
cause
to
complain
the
place
had
been
cheap
just
the
little
he
had
left
after
amelia
s
burial
and
it
would
serve
its
purpose
there
was
only
one
place
where
jake
carwood
s
description
had
gone
badly
awry
the
peace
and
quiet
it
had
n
t
started
out
that
way
and
he
had
a
feeling
thanks
to
the
girl
that
things
would
get
worse
before
they
got
better
they
had
the
house
cleaned
up
by
noon
and
wilson
sent
the
boy
out
to
the
meadow
to
bring
in
the
horses
he
stood
on
the
porch
and
watched
him
struggling
with
the
heavy
harness
and
finally
went
over
to
help
him
kathy
was
already
in
the
wagon
they
were
going
to
town
and
they
were
both
excited
wilson
backed
the
team
into
the
traces
and
wished
they
were
n
t
going
to
town
at
all
he
had
an
uneasy
feeling
about
it
that
girl
last
night
what
was
her
name
judith
pierce
it
was
the
only
thing
about
her
that
was
the
least
bit
hard
to
remember
he
finished
with
the
team
and
filled
his
pipe
and
stood
looking
about
him
he
had
spent
two
hours
riding
around
the
ranch
that
morning
and
in
broad
daylight
it
was
even
less
inviting
than
judith
pierce
had
made
it
seem
there
was
brush
and
stands
of
pine
that
no
grass
could
grow
under
and
places
so
steep
that
cattle
would
n
t
stop
to
graze
but
there
was
water
there
was
an
artificial
lake
just
out
of
sight
in
the
first
stand
of
trees
fed
by
a
half
dozen
springs
that
popped
out
of
the
ground
above
the
hillside
orchard
yes
there
was
plenty
of
water
too
much
and
that
was
probably
the
trouble
there
were
tracks
of
cattle
all
over
his
six
hundred
and
forty
acres
the
first
part
of
the
road
was
steep
but
it
leveled
off
after
the
second
bend
and
curled
gradually
into
the
valley
it
was
hotter
once
they
reached
the
flat
and
drier
but
the
grass
was
better
a
warm
breeze
played
across
it
moving
it
like
waves
a
red
tailed
hawk
flew
in
behind
them
and
stayed
there
watching
for
any
snakes
or
rabbits
that
they
might
stir
up
from
the
side
of
the
road
it
took
them
an
hour
before
they
came
to
the
first
houses
of
kelseyville
the
town
was
about
what
wilson
expected
one
main
street
with
its
rows
of
false
fronted
buildings
a
water
tower
a
few
warehouses
a
single
hotel
all
dusty
and
sunbaked
the
place
was
quiet
such
was
my
state
of
mind
that
i
did
not
question
the
possibility
of
this
under
the
circumstances
i
was
only
too
willing
to
confess
all
i
was
nearly
thirty
at
the
time
i
went
to
the
hall
in
the
afternoons
only
on
these
preliminary
matters
it
was
dark
and
i
sensed
very
large
only
the
counter
at
one
end
was
lighted
by
a
long
fluorescent
tube
suspended
directly
above
it
sometimes
i
was
aware
of
people
moving
about
in
the
darkness
i
would
turn
away
from
my
writing
in
the
hope
of
getting
a
good
look
at
them
but
i
never
quite
succeeded
a
glimpse
of
three
of
four
vague
figures
at
the
most
drifting
here
and
there
squatting
as
if
waiting
the
pulsing
glow
of
a
cigarette
since
they
could
see
me
but
i
not
them
their
presence
in
the
hall
disturbed
me
the
clerk
paid
them
no
attention
this
impressed
me
until
i
realized
how
limited
was
his
sphere
of
influence
his
job
simply
consisted
in
registering
new
men
when
the
phone
rang
he
answered
it
his
authority
extended
to
the
far
edge
of
the
counter
no
further
none
of
the
men
hanging
around
the
hall
bothered
to
speak
to
him
baldness
was
attacking
his
pate
he
spoke
to
me
in
a
gruff
voice
an
affectation
which
quite
belied
his
personality
he
wore
his
white
shirt
open
at
the
neck
revealing
a
bit
of
scrawny
pale
chest
underneath
it
was
obvious
that
he
wished
himself
different
from
the
sort
of
person
he
thought
he
was
but
it
was
not
easy
for
him
and
he
often
slipped
when
one
of
the
men
in
the
hall
behind
us
spat
on
the
floor
and
scraped
his
boot
over
the
gob
of
spittle
i
noticed
how
the
clerk
winced
i
felt
certain
he
was
really
a
spineless
little
man
his
hat
the
cause
of
his
baldness
hung
on
a
hook
on
the
wall
and
underneath
it
i
could
see
his
tie
knotted
ready
to
be
slipped
over
his
head
a
black
badge
of
frayed
respectability
that
ought
never
to
have
left
his
neck
the
morning
s
tabloids
were
on
the
counter
and
a
stack
of
dog
eared
men
s
magazines
on
a
shelf
in
the
office
behind
the
counter
was
a
small
radio
dialed
permanently
on
a
station
which
broadcast
only
vulgar
commercials
and
cheap
popular
music
everything
about
the
clerk
was
trivial
once
pressing
him
i
learned
that
his
job
was
only
part
time
in
the
afternoons
when
nothing
went
on
in
the
hall
noticing
my
disappointment
he
attempted
to
salvage
what
scraps
and
shreds
of
authority
he
felt
might
still
be
clinging
to
his
person
with
distaste
i
saw
him
assume
a
pompous
air
when
he
saw
me
coming
he
turned
his
radio
off
he
made
a
show
of
rearranging
my
forms
on
the
shelf
he
would
pick
up
the
ringing
phone
with
studied
negligence
then
bark
into
it
with
gruff
importance
what
limited
knowledge
he
possessed
he
forced
upon
me
in
the
mornings
i
was
informed
fluorescent
tubes
similar
to
the
one
above
the
counter
illuminated
the
entire
hall
they
and
the
two
large
fans
which
i
could
dimly
see
as
daylight
filtered
through
their
vents
down
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
could
be
turned
on
by
a
master
switch
situated
inside
the
office
he
pointed
out
the
switch
to
me
and
for
a
moment
i
foolishly
believed
that
he
would
let
deed
follow
words
i
was
shown
instead
a
batch
of
white
tickets
of
the
sort
handed
out
he
told
me
every
morning
now
here
was
something
of
obvious
importance
to
me
yet
when
i
reached
for
the
tickets
he
snatched
them
away
from
my
hand
he
could
n
t
afford
to
have
anyone
mess
around
with
them
he
said
each
of
those
tickets
was
of
great
value
to
its
rightful
recipient
i
withdrew
my
hand
later
i
would
remember
what
this
pompous
little
man
had
told
me
about
the
worth
of
a
ticket
having
nothing
else
to
do
except
wait
for
my
forms
to
be
processed
i
gave
myself
over
to
speculations
concerning
the
hall
itself
when
suitably
lighted
what
would
it
look
like
the
presence
of
the
two
exhaust
fans
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
hall
could
become
crowded
for
air
one
afternoon
upon
receiving
permission
and
the
necessary
instructions
from
the
clerk
i
had
visited
the
toilet
adjoining
the
hall
by
counting
the
number
of
stalls
and
urinals
i
attempted
to
form
a
loose
estimate
of
how
many
men
the
hall
would
hold
at
one
time
for
although
i
had
crossed
a
corner
of
the
hall
on
my
way
to
the
toilet
i
still
could
not
tell
for
sure
how
far
to
the
rear
the
darkness
extended
i
could
observe
the
two
fans
down
at
the
end
but
their
size
in
themselves
meant
nothing
to
me
as
long
as
i
had
no
measure
of
comparison
i
had
for
some
time
been
hoping
in
vain
for
one
of
the
dim
figures
to
pass
between
the
fan
vents
and
myself
i
knew
that
three
or
four
of
them
were
almost
always
present
in
the
hall
but
what
they
were
doing
and
exactly
where
i
could
not
tell
it
was
i
felt
possible
that
they
were
men
who
having
received
no
tickets
for
that
day
had
remained
in
the
hall
to
sleep
perhaps
in
the
corners
farthest
removed
from
the
counter
with
its
overhead
light
this
light
did
not
penetrate
very
far
back
into
the
hall
and
my
eyes
were
hindered
rather
than
aided
by
the
dim
daylight
entering
through
the
fan
vents
when
i
tried
to
pick
out
whatever
might
be
lying
or
squatting
on
the
floor
below
also
the
clerk
appeared
to
disapprove
of
my
frequent
curious
glances
back
over
my
shoulder
no
sooner
would
i
turn
my
head
away
from
the
counter
before
he
would
address
me
at
times
quite
sharply
in
order
to
bring
back
my
attention
and
i
had
hardly
finished
my
business
in
the
toilet
on
the
aforementioned
occasion
when
the
lights
in
that
place
like
the
hall
lights
controlled
from
the
switch
in
the
office
flicked
off
and
on
impatiently
this
sort
of
petty
vigilance
annoyed
me
i
felt
certain
it
was
self
appointed
it
sprang
from
a
type
of
mentality
i
d
encountered
often
enough
but
certainly
had
not
expected
to
find
here
i
decided
to
see
no
more
of
the
clerk
until
the
processing
of
my
papers
was
completed
i
felt
strongly
attached
to
the
hall
however
and
hardly
a
day
passed
when
i
did
not
go
to
look
at
it
from
a
distance
i
lived
in
a
state
of
suspense
because
of
it
i
could
not
cling
to
my
past
nor
did
i
wish
to
i
had
signed
it
off
on
the
forms
my
future
lay
solely
with
the
hall
yet
what
did
i
know
about
the
hall
at
this
point
although
i
had
been
inside
it
i
had
not
yet
seen
it
functioning
i
wished
to
prepare
myself
but
did
not
even
know
what
sort
of
clothes
i
ought
to
be
wearing
i
did
not
despair
however
far
from
it
i
was
constantly
searching
for
clues
around
the
neighborhood
of
the
hall
though
only
a
relatively
short
walk
separated
it
from
my
own
part
of
town
its
character
was
wholly
foreign
to
me
large
warehouses
flanked
the
street
on
which
the
hall
fronted
the
river
was
only
a
few
blocks
away
but
an
unbroken
line
of
piers
prevented
me
from
seeing
it
sometimes
i
noticed
the
tops
of
ships
masts
and
funnels
reaching
above
the
pier
roofs
the
sounds
issuing
from
beyond
winches
whirring
men
shouting
indicated
great
activity
and
excited
me
the
hall
on
the
other
hand
appeared
lifeless
and
deserted
on
these
long
waterfront
afternoons
it
resembled
nothing
i
d
ever
seen
before
its
front
was
windowless
but
irregularities
in
the
masonry
might
be
an
indication
that
windows
now
blinded
had
once
looked
out
upon
the
street
i
kept
circling
the
block
hoping
to
see
from
the
street
behind
it
the
rear
of
the
hall
but
it
was
not
a
tall
structure
and
other
buildings
concealed
it
for
weeks
i
wandered
about
this
neighborhood
of
warehouses
and
garages
truck
terminals
and
taxi
repair
shops
gasoline
pumps
and
longshoremen
s
lunch
counters
yet
never
did
i
cease
to
feel
myself
a
stranger
there
i
returned
to
the
hall
despite
my
dislike
for
the
clerk
as
i
had
expected
he
insisted
that
my
visits
to
the
hall
would
do
nothing
to
further
the
process
of
my
application
meanwhile
spring
had
passed
well
into
summer
at
last
when
i
put
it
to
him
directly
the
clerk
was
forced
to
admit
that
the
delay
in
my
case
was
unusual
when
i
asked
him
what
if
anything
i
could
do
about
it
he
surprised
me
by
referring
me
to
the
director
of
the
hall
i
could
consult
this
personage
on
any
weekday
morning
though
not
before
ten
o
clock
the
clerk
impressed
this
upon
me
that
i
should
not
arrive
in
the
hall
before
ten
o
clock
when
i
went
for
my
interview
with
the
director
i
saw
why
although
it
was
dark
as
usual
i
could
see
that
the
hall
had
only
recently
contained
a
great
many
people
cigarette
butts
littered
the
floor
the
big
fans
were
going
drawing
from
the
large
room
the
remnants
of
stale
smoke
which
drifted
about
in
pale
strata
underneath
the
ceiling
i
had
felt
the
draft
they
were
making
while
mounting
the
stairs
the
staircase
itself
seemed
still
to
be
echoing
the
heavy
footfalls
of
many
men
i
stopped
by
the
counter
no
one
was
behind
it
but
in
the
rear
wall
of
the
office
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
a
door
which
had
been
left
partially
open
past
it
i
could
see
part
of
a
desk
a
flag
in
a
corner
a
rug
on
the
floor
the
director
s
office
i
rapped
my
knuckles
on
the
counter
the
director
came
to
the
door
i
was
at
once
disappointed
although
just
what
i
had
expected
him
to
look
like
i
could
not
have
explained
he
was
a
man
in
his
late
forties
with
graying
hair
of
medium
height
he
looked
dapper
in
a
lightweight
summer
suit
brown
silk
tie
and
green
tinted
soft
collar
he
wore
perforated
white
topped
shoes
they
somehow
made
me
expect
to
see
him
launch
into
a
vaudeville
tapdance
routine
any
moment
but
he
came
toward
me
sedately
enough
showed
me
around
the
counter
offered
me
a
seat
inside
his
office
then
walked
to
a
file
cabinet
and
got
out
my
application
i
had
the
impression
that
he
had
read
my
forms
perhaps
several
times
he
did
not
look
at
them
now
as
he
lowered
himself
on
the
chair
behind
his
desk
i
wondered
what
this
dapper
slightly
ridiculous
man
could
possibly
have
to
do
with
the
workings
of
the
hall
he
spoke
in
a
voice
as
immaculate
as
his
appearance
why
had
i
registered
begging
my
pardon
he
must
express
his
astonishment
over
seeing
a
person
of
my
background
applying
at
the
hall
he
had
looked
over
my
forms
and
was
impressed
by
what
he
had
seen
there
indeed
my
scholastic
qualifications
were
such
that
he
a
college
graduate
himself
must
envy
me
them
was
i
sure
he
asked
that
i
knew
what
i
was
applying
for
what
sort
of
men
i
would
come
into
contact
with
at
the
hall
these
questions
did
not
surprise
me
i
felt
certain
that
the
director
like
the
afternoon
clerk
seldom
moved
beyond
the
counter
that
the
hall
to
them
was
a
jungle
a
dark
and
unwelcome
place
though
i
doubted
that
he
would
understand
me
i
told
the
director
my
motives
for
applying
i
had
always
i
said
hankered
after
working
hard
with
my
hands
this
desire
i
went
on
growing
voluble
as
my
conviction
was
aroused
had
mounted
at
such
a
rate
recently
that
i
now
found
its
realization
necessary
not
only
to
my
physical
but
also
to
my
spiritual
wellbeing
to
this
effect
i
had
already
severed
all
connections
which
bound
me
to
my
former
existence
the
flat
hard
cap
was
small
but
he
thrust
it
to
the
back
of
his
head
tie
him
up
hell
with
it
before
they
could
guess
his
intention
rankin
stepped
forward
and
swung
the
guard
s
own
gun
against
the
uncovered
head
hard
the
man
went
over
without
sound
falling
to
the
bare
floor
barton
said
harshly
why
did
you
do
that
rankin
sneered
at
him
what
did
you
want
me
to
do
kiss
him
he
dumped
me
in
solitary
twice
barton
caught
the
lighter
man
s
shoulder
and
swung
him
around
let
s
get
one
thing
straight
you
and
me
the
only
reason
we
brought
you
was
to
get
miller
out
if
you
ever
try
anything
without
my
orders
i
ll
kill
you
fred
rankin
looked
at
him
it
seemed
to
barton
that
the
green
eyes
mocked
him
the
thin
lipped
smile
held
insolence
but
he
had
no
time
to
waste
now
come
on
let
s
move
they
filed
out
through
the
guard
room
door
into
the
paved
square
there
were
three
other
men
within
this
prison
whom
barton
would
have
liked
to
liberate
but
they
were
in
other
cell
blocks
there
was
no
chance
they
moved
slowly
toward
the
main
gate
following
the
wall
there
was
no
moon
they
had
chosen
this
night
purposely
they
reached
the
guard
house
without
alerting
the
men
on
the
walls
above
and
powers
slipped
through
the
door
two
men
were
on
duty
inside
playing
pinochle
relaxed
they
looked
up
in
surprise
as
powers
came
in
what
are
you
doing
out
of
the
block
it
s
curtiss
he
said
naming
the
man
rankin
had
hit
i
ve
got
to
have
help
they
stared
at
him
the
sergeant
in
charge
climbed
to
his
feet
what
s
wrong
with
him
he
s
having
some
kind
of
a
fit
the
sergeant
turned
to
the
door
as
he
passed
through
it
barton
shoved
his
gun
against
the
man
s
side
one
sound
and
you
re
dead
the
sergeant
froze
powers
had
not
followed
powers
was
covering
the
remaining
guard
the
man
half
reached
for
the
cord
of
the
alarm
bell
powers
knocked
his
arm
aside
deliberately
with
none
of
rankin
s
viciousness
he
laid
the
barrel
of
his
gun
alongside
the
guard
s
head
they
were
free
even
barton
could
not
quite
believe
it
it
had
gone
without
a
hitch
they
slid
through
the
wicket
in
the
big
gate
ghosted
across
the
dark
ground
five
minutes
later
they
reached
the
horses
barton
was
relieved
to
see
that
carl
dill
and
emmett
foster
had
brought
extra
mounts
he
had
been
worried
that
with
miller
and
rankin
added
to
the
escape
party
they
would
be
short
no
one
hurried
they
walked
the
horses
heading
along
the
river
barton
and
emmett
foster
in
the
lead
seven
men
riding
quietly
through
the
night
the
only
thing
which
would
have
attracted
attention
was
that
two
wore
the
uniform
of
prison
guards
three
the
striped
suits
of
convicts
five
miles
in
a
small
grove
against
the
river
they
halted
turning
deep
into
the
protection
of
the
trees
foster
had
brought
extra
clothing
also
a
good
man
emmett
he
had
been
one
of
the
original
night
riders
one
who
had
escaped
the
trial
it
was
to
him
that
barton
had
sent
carl
dill
on
dill
s
release
from
the
prison
clyde
miller
was
crying
softly
to
himself
shedding
his
striped
suit
and
fumbling
into
the
nondescript
butternut
pants
the
worn
brown
shirt
kid
boyd
was
unusually
silent
rankin
watchful
a
few
paces
apart
barton
finished
his
dressing
and
extended
his
hand
to
powers
i
wo
n
t
even
try
to
thank
you
the
ex
prison
guard
was
embarrassed
he
said
in
a
studied
voice
i
did
n
t
do
it
for
you
i
did
it
for
the
valley
you
re
the
only
man
the
night
riders
will
follow
we
ve
been
starving
and
i
do
n
t
like
to
starve
barton
turned
away
his
eyes
falling
upon
rankin
beside
his
horse
good
luck
the
murderer
lifted
his
head
meaning
you
want
me
to
ride
out
you
are
n
t
one
of
us
there
s
nothing
for
you
here
i
got
no
place
to
go
barton
hesitated
he
did
not
trust
rankin
his
violent
temper
his
killer
instinct
but
ten
years
in
prison
had
taught
him
realities
they
were
in
a
fight
outweighed
in
both
numbers
and
money
it
was
all
right
to
put
a
bunch
of
ranchers
onto
horses
to
call
them
night
riders
to
set
out
to
attack
the
largest
mining
combination
the
country
had
ever
seen
if
all
they
wanted
was
adventure
but
if
they
really
hoped
to
succeed
they
needed
professionals
men
who
knew
how
to
use
a
gun
against
men
who
would
match
the
killers
on
the
other
side
your
choice
he
said
briefly
and
turned
to
kid
boyd
bury
those
uniforms
so
they
wo
n
t
be
found
then
barton
touched
carl
dill
s
arm
and
moved
off
up
the
river
bank
he
wanted
a
careful
uninterrupted
report
from
dill
on
the
conditions
in
the
valley
they
squatted
on
their
heels
in
the
deep
mud
and
dill
found
a
cigar
in
his
breast
pocket
passing
it
over
silently
he
too
knew
the
agony
of
going
for
weeks
sometimes
months
without
the
solace
of
tobacco
mitchell
barton
drew
in
the
fragrance
deeply
letting
the
smoke
lie
warm
and
soothing
in
his
throat
for
a
moment
before
he
exhaled
through
the
gloom
he
could
not
see
the
man
beside
him
clearly
but
he
knew
him
thoroughly
for
his
first
five
years
in
prison
they
had
shared
a
cell
carl
dill
was
neither
a
rancher
nor
a
valley
man
he
had
been
the
auditor
for
the
mining
syndicate
and
he
had
stolen
fifty
thousand
dollars
of
the
syndicate
s
money
he
had
done
time
for
the
theft
the
one
thing
they
had
in
common
was
their
hatred
both
hated
donald
kruger
it
had
drawn
them
together
and
since
his
release
from
prison
dill
had
worked
tirelessly
to
effect
this
night
s
escape
he
said
now
i
ve
got
the
perfect
headquarters
set
up
the
old
haskell
mine
mitch
barton
knew
the
place
twenty
years
before
a
group
of
easterners
had
bought
out
the
haskell
claims
in
the
rocky
hills
south
of
grass
valley
they
had
spent
a
million
dollars
carving
in
a
road
putting
up
buildings
drilling
their
haulage
tunnel
then
the
vein
had
petered
out
and
the
whole
project
had
been
abandoned
the
road
s
washed
badly
said
dill
but
there
s
a
trail
you
can
get
over
with
a
horse
a
company
of
cavalry
could
n
t
come
in
there
if
two
men
were
guarding
that
trail
barton
nodded
how
do
the
valley
people
feel
as
mad
as
ever
but
kruger
s
men
keep
them
off
balance
and
they
do
n
t
trust
me
i
m
an
outsider
when
they
learn
you
re
in
the
hills
though
they
ll
rally
do
n
t
worry
about
that
barton
waited
for
a
long
moment
then
asked
the
question
which
lay
always
uppermost
in
his
mind
my
boy
did
you
find
him
dill
was
silent
as
if
he
hated
to
answer
and
barton
had
a
cold
sick
feeling
of
apprehension
he
s
in
morgan
s
ferry
barton
half
straightened
in
surprise
what
s
he
doing
there
again
dill
hesitated
dealing
faro
dealing
faro
how
come
your
sister
in
law
has
the
faro
bank
in
cap
ayres
saloon
barton
cursed
under
his
breath
after
another
long
pause
he
asked
how
many
people
know
who
they
are
everyone
your
cousin
finley
saw
to
that
he
s
quite
a
rat
you
know
he
sold
out
to
kruger
s
men
he
s
informed
them
of
everything
you
ve
ever
written
him
he
wants
your
ranch
barton
stood
up
he
said
tensely
all
right
let
s
go
get
the
boy
dill
had
come
up
also
i
was
afraid
of
this
i
almost
did
n
t
tell
you
if
you
had
n
t
i
d
have
killed
you
dill
s
voice
tightened
but
you
ca
n
t
ride
into
the
ferry
that
s
what
they
ll
expect
you
to
do
they
ll
be
there
waiting
for
you
i
understand
how
you
feel
about
the
child
the
hell
you
do
barton
s
voice
was
rougher
than
dill
had
ever
heard
it
i
never
saw
him
my
wife
died
in
childbirth
after
i
was
sent
away
i
ca
n
t
leave
him
there
donald
kruger
would
like
nothing
better
than
to
hold
him
as
hostage
and
i
would
n
t
entrust
a
snake
to
his
tender
care
i
ve
got
to
get
the
boy
let

ride
chapter
two
barton
s
men
cut
the
telegraph
wires
in
half
a
dozen
places
carrying
away
whole
sections
to
make
repairs
more
difficult
it
was
over
an
hour
before
their
escape
was
discovered
but
still
the
news
that
barton
was
free
flashed
across
the
central
portion
of
the
state
it
reached
donald
kruger
in
his
massive
home
in
burlingame
it
reached
the
mines
at
north
san
juan
and
bloomfield
it
brought
men
out
of
bed
and
sent
them
into
hurried
conferences
for
everyone
involved
knew
that
the
whole
valley
was
a
powder
keg
and
mitchell
barton
the
fuse
which
could
send
it
into
explosive
violence
creighton
hague
sat
in
his
office
above
the
ione
pit
the
office
was
of
logs
four
rooms
each
heated
by
an
iron
stove
the
building
was
dwarfed
by
the
scene
outside
there
a
dozen
giant
monitors
played
their
seventy
five
foot
jets
of
water
against
the
huge
seam
of
tertiary
gravel
which
was
the
mountainside
the
gravel
was
the
bed
of
an
ancient
river
buckled
in
some
prehistoric
upheaval
of
earth
it
was
partially
cemented
by
ages
and
pressure
yet
it
crumpled
before
the
onslaught
of
the
powerful
streams
the
force
of
a
thousand
fire
hoses
and
with
the
gold
it
held
washed
down
through
the
long
sluices
a
million
dollars
of
gold
a
month
a
million
tons
of
rock
and
soil
and
brush
the
monitors
ran
twenty
four
hours
each
day
their
roar
like
the
swelling
volume
of
a
hundred
tornadoes
could
be
heard
for
miles
hague
like
all
who
worked
near
the
pits
was
partly
deafened
from
the
constant
assault
against
his
eardrums
he
was
a
big
man
wearing
a
neat
flannel
shirt
against
the
cold
foothill
air
fat
showed
in
loose
rolls
beneath
the
shirt
ten
years
older
than
mitch
barton
he
had
clawed
his
way
up
from
mucker
in
the
pits
to
manager
of
the
operation
he
was
proud
of
his
accomplishments
proud
of
his
job
proud
that
donald
kruger
and
his
associates
trusted
him
he
lived
and
breathed
for
the
mining
company
no
man
could
have
reached
his
spot
nor
held
it
without
being
ruthless
and
hague
had
made
a
virtue
of
ruthlessness
all
of
his
life
there
came
a
ghost
of
noise
at
the
office
door
and
hague
swung
to
see
kodyke
in
the
entrance
from
the
outer
room
hague
had
never
accustomed
himself
to
kodyke
the
man
was
tall
thin
with
a
narrow
face
and
a
too
large
nose
the
eyes
always
held
hague
eyes
of
a
dead
man
lidless
as
a
lizard
s
with
the
fixed
intensity
of
a
cobra
even
hague
was
repelled
by
the
machinelike
deadliness
that
was
kodyke
he
knew
nothing
about
the
man
s
history
kodyke
had
appeared
at
the
mine
one
day
bearing
a
letter
from
kruger
kodyke
was
to
head
the
dread
company
police
he
ran
the
change
rooms
he
threw
out
the
hi
graders
he
supervised
the
cleanups
and
handled
the
shipments
of
raw
gold
which
each
week
went
out
to
san
francisco
hague
squeezed
down
his
uneasy
dislike
he
pulled
open
the
top
drawer
of
his
desk
and
drew
out
a
tintype
this
is
mitchell
barton
he
broke
out
of
folsom
last
night
apparently
he
bribed
one
of
the
guards
we
want
him
back
there
or
we
want
him
dead
kodyke
took
the
picture
in
a
lean
hand
studying
it
thoughtfully
dangerous
dangerous
yes
you
know
how
the
ranchers
in
the
valley
are
they
blame
us
for
all
their
troubles
ten
years
ago
they
blew
up
some
of
our
ditches
it
cost
us
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
thirty
days
lost
time
to
fix
them
we
do
n
t
want
barton
s
night
riders
loose
again
the
gunman
nodded
slipping
the
picture
into
his
breast
pocket
saying
nothing
normally
hague
wasted
no
words
but
now
he
found
himself
unable
to
stop
their
flow
although
he
knew
kodyke
was
aware
of
all
he
said
if
she
sensed
any
unusual
preoccupation
on
the
part
of
her
mother
she
did
not
comment
upon
it
after
they
had
finished
eating
melissa
took
sprite
the
kitten
under
her
arm
so
that
auntie
grace
can
teach
it
about
the
whistle
and
climbed
into
the
station
wagon
beside
her
mother
she
had
offered
to
walk
but
pamela
knew
she
would
not
feel
comfortable
about
her
child
until
she
had
personally
confided
her
to
the
care
of
the
little
pink
woman
who
chose
to
be
called
auntie
when
they
reached
their
neighbor
s
house
pamela
said
a
few
polite
words
to
grace
and
kissed
melissa
lightly
on
the
forehead
the
impulse
prompted
by
a
stray
thought
of
the
type
to
which
she
was
frequently
subject
these
days
that
they
might
never
see
one
another
again
then
she
turned
the
station
wagon
around
and
headed
it
back
down
the
hill
with
the
village
as
her
ostensible
destination
as
she
drove
she
thought
about
her
plan
it
was
really
quite
simple
so
simple
in
fact
that
it
might
even
work
although
pamela
now
in
her
new
frame
of
mind
was
careful
not
to
pretend
too
much
assurance
that
mistake
she
thought
had
cost
her
dearly
these
past
few
days
and
she
wanted
to
avoid
falling
into
any
more
of
the
traps
that
the
mountain
might
set
for
her
she
must
be
cautious
so
as
not
to
alert
the
scheming
forest
when
the
station
wagon
drew
abreast
of
the
dusty
dirt
road
that
led
up
to
the
porch
of
the
culver
house
pamela
turned
the
wheel
guiding
the
car
to
its
familiar
parking
spot
close
to
the
house
and
stopped
all
of
her
movements
were
careful
and
methodical
partaking
of
the
stealth
of
a
criminal
who
has
plotted
his
felony
for
months
in
advance
and
knows
exactly
which
step
to
take
next
in
the
course
of
the
final
execution
of
his
crime
she
locked
the
ignition
removed
the
keys
stepped
out
of
the
car
and
went
into
the
house
here
she
dropped
the
keys
on
a
small
table
beside
the
door
and
went
upstairs
to
her
bedroom
on
her
bureau
lay
a
small
brass
ornament
of
simple
design
and
faded
engraving
an
object
which
pamela
believed
now
had
been
the
property
of
her
great
grandfather
major
hiram
munroe
culver
he
had
belonged
to
this
land
and
perhaps
had
desecrated
it
and
this
was
the
only
material
symbol
that
remained
of
him
if
she
pamela
were
being
held
responsible
for
his
crimes
then
hers
must
be
the
final
act
of
expiation
she
would
return
this
symbol
to
the
mountain
as
one
pours
seed
back
into
the
soil
every
spring
or
as
ancient
fertility
cults
demand
annual
human
sacrifice
slowly
and
thoughtfully
she
slipped
the
ornament
into
the
pocket
of
her
slacks
moved
down
the
stairs
and
out
of
the
house
there
was
only
one
place
where
the
mountain
might
receive
her
that
unnamed
unnameable
pool
harbored
in
its
secret
bosom
atonement
if
atonement
were
possible
could
only
be
made
at
that
sacred
sacrificial
basin
it
was
there
that
she
would
have
to
enact
her
renunciation
beg
forgiveness
perhaps
it
was
insane
pamela
thought
perhaps
it
was
all
a
vividly
conceived
dream
but
she
was
caught
in
it
and
she
faced
the
terrible
possibility
that
if
it
were
a
dream
it
was
one
from
which
she
might
never
awaken
facing
the
forest
now
she
who
had
not
dared
to
enter
it
before
walked
between
two
trees
at
random
and
headed
in
what
she
believed
was
the
direction
of
the
pool
she
remembered
little
of
her
previous
journey
there
with
grace
and
she
could
but
hope
that
her
dedication
to
her
mission
would
enable
her
to
accomplish
it
the
forest
was
open
and
freely
welcoming
extending
an
enchanted
hand
the
ground
was
covered
with
soft
pine
needles
and
the
slope
was
gentle
birds
chirped
and
chattered
in
the
trees
and
the
sun
all
dewy
eyed
and
soft
caressed
her
shoulders
warmly
from
time
to
time
it
was
not
thought
pamela
such
an
evil
place
after
all
no
wonder
melissa
responded
so
completely
to
its
beckoning
perhaps
she
had
no
reason
to
fear
these
trees
that
whispered
their
secrets
above
her
head
as
she
passed
was
it
not
possible
after
all
that
the
forest
was
in
league
with
her
and
her
child
that
its
sympathy
lay
with
the
culvers
that
she
had
erred
in
failing
to
understand
this
pamela
felt
calm
and
peaceful
as
she
walked
along
the
slight
flutter
that
had
disturbed
the
motion
of
her
heart
when
she
entered
the
forest
was
gone
now
and
even
the
dim
groves
of
trees
through
which
she
occasionally
passed
did
not
reawaken
her
fear
she
regarded
them
as
signs
that
she
was
nearing
the
glen
she
sought
and
she
was
glad
to
at
last
be
doing
something
positive
in
her
unenunciated
undefined
struggle
with
the
mountain
and
its
darkling
inhabitants
having
persisted
too
long
in
deliberate
ignorance
and
denial
of
the
forces
that
threatened
her
pamela
was
relieved
now
to
admit
their
potency
and
to
be
taking
definite
steps
toward
grappling
with
them
a
few
days
ago
she
would
have
thought
such
an
expedition
as
this
utterly
ridiculous
today
on
the
contrary
it
seemed
utterly
reasonable
she
did
not
pause
to
consider
what
she
would
do
if
her
plan
should
fail
she
directed
all
of
her
mental
and
physical
energy
toward
achieving
this
one
goal
if
as
she
walked
her
steps
fumbled
from
time
to
time
she
chose
to
ignore
that
omen
if
the
slope
grew
steeper
and
the
groves
more
dim
she
tried
not
to
heed
success
depended
upon
maintaining
her
equanimity
she
must
be
poised
and
proud
and
unafraid
in
order
to
prove
to
the
mountain
that
she
was
in
earnest
the
forest
took
on
an
impersonal
aspect
it
did
not
care
what
sort
of
person
prowled
its
woods
plucked
at
its
bark
or
stripped
the
berries
from
its
bushes
unconcerned
indifferent
unmotivated
the
forest
was
simply
there
fighting
man
s
depredations
with
more
abundant
growth
and
man
s
follies
with
its
own
musical
evening
laughter
red
man
or
white
man
pacifist
or
killer
the
forest
would
accept
them
all
knowing
that
it
could
thrive
equally
well
on
slaughter
and
beneficence
knowing
that
its
ageless
mass
would
always
dwarf
the
short
span
of
time
allotted
to
any
man
pamela
shook
her
head
she
must
not
think
about
time
that
was
another
one
of
those
traps
in
her
grim
pursuit
of
tranquillity
pamela
focused
her
thoughts
on
her
husband
if
when
this
was
all
over
she
found
the
words
to
tell
him
about
it
she
wondered
if
he
would
ever
understand
how
could
he
comprehend
her
need
when
he
himself
was
innocent
indian
ghosts
would
not
impinge
upon
his
nights
nor
would
his
days
be
haunted
by
the
dimly
outlined
ill
conceived
figure
of
her
benighted
ancestor
his
bright
daylight
mind
would
whistle
away
such
images
they
would
not
dare
to
face
his
scoffing
pamela
was
glad
jim
was
nowhere
near
his
presence
would
have
interfered
with
her
duty
the
mountainside
grew
steeper
and
she
slipped
once
or
twice
on
the
smooth
pine
needles
the
trees
huddled
more
closely
together
their
limbs
and
leaves
intertwined
in
a
coarse
curtain
against
the
sun
bushes
and
vines
abetted
the
rocks
in
forming
thorny
detours
for
the
struggling
stranger
and
without
the
direct
light
of
the
sun
to
act
as
compass
pamela
could
no
longer
be
positive
of
her
direction
nevertheless
she
continued
to
move
upward
she
was
sure
she
would
reach
the
pool
by
climbing
and
she
clung
to
that
belief
despite
the
increasing
number
of
obstacles
the
forest
had
become
an
alien
world
where
she
strove
alone
unprotected
unguided
to
deal
with
whatever
hindrances
were
offered
it
was
a
bold
dark
castle
of
pine
boughs
that
stood
like
a
medieval
fortress
eclipsing
the
sun
and
human
time
at
one
and
the
same
time
she
was
within
it
but
still
searching
for
the
drawbridge
that
would
give
her
entry
silence
came
into
the
forest
a
solid
being
that
clapped
its
hand
over
the
murmuring
mouths
of
the
birds
and
the
whispered
comfort
of
the
trees
silence
walked
at
pamela
s
side
its
presence
numbingly
close
yet
too
far
for
her
to
hear
silence
stood
in
front
of
her
waiting
and
in
back
of
her
blocking
her
retreat
she
stumbled
over
the
root
of
a
tree
that
protruded
maliciously
above
the
earth
in
spite
of
her
attempt
to
preserve
her
balance
she
fell
bruising
her
arm
on
a
naked
stone
for
a
moment
she
could
not
catch
her
breath
and
then
her
breath
returning
in
short
frightened
spasms
she
lifted
herself
to
her
feet
laboriously
she
started
to
brush
the
dirt
and
bits
of
leaves
off
her
clothes
her
arm
bled
slightly
and
the
offended
skin
cried
out
in
pain
she
looked
around
she
was
bewildered
she
seemed
to
have
come
such
a
long
distance
too
far
for
her
destination
which
had
wilfully
been
swallowed
up
in
the
greedy
gloom
of
the
trees
she
stood
quite
still
trying
to
focus
upon
a
direction
in
which
to
turn
a
path
to
follow
a
clue
to
guide
her
she
was
standing
in
a
thick
grove
the
trees
were
crowded
so
closely
together
that
their
branches
overlapped
virtually
shutting
out
the
sun
completely
the
earth
smelled
moist
and
pungent
as
it
might
in
a
cave
deprived
of
the
cleansing
effect
of
the
sun
s
rays
she
had
the
feeling
that
under
the
mouldering
leaves
there
would
be
the
bodies
of
dead
animals
quietly
decaying
and
giving
their
soil
back
to
the
mountain
the
thought
made
pamela
shudder
a
terrible
chill
swept
through
the
grove
not
a
breeze
exactly
but
a
pocket
of
icy
air
that
settled
with
a
loathsome
familiarity
upon
the
deep
confines
of
the
grove
catching
pamela
in
a
leering
embrace
there
was
a
peculiar
density
about
it
a
thick
substance
that
could
be
sensed
but
never
identified
never
actually
perceived
where
before
had
she
felt
or
dreamt
or
imagined
such
a
scene
she
already
knew
this
unwholesome
chilling
atmosphere
that
was
somehow
grotesquely
alive
it
enclosed
her
clammy
hands
and
twined
around
her
ankles
it
crept
into
the
open
neck
of
her
blouse
and
slid
down
her
body
seeping
into
her
flesh
through
all
the
quivering
pores
of
her
skin
it
crawled
across
her
breasts
suffocating
the
life
in
her
nipples
it
circled
her
thighs
exploring
with
its
icy
tentacles
it
entered
her
body
with
the
ghastly
intimacy
of
an
incubus
and
its
particles
spreading
creeping
crawling
joined
themselves
into
steel
bands
that
constricted
her
knees
so
tightly
that
they
ached
stifled
her
lungs
so
that
her
breath
came
in
harsh
gasps
clutched
her
throat
and
sucked
up
the
moisture
in
her
mouth
so
that
her
tongue
was
dry
and
hard
and
stuck
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
and
her
teeth
were
clenched
together
in
the
rigid
fixture
of
her
jaws
she
had
to
get
away
from
here
before
this
demoniac
possession
swallowed
up
the
liquid
of
her
eyes
and
sank
into
the
fibers
of
her
brain
depriving
her
of
reason
and
sight
but
she
did
not
know
which
way
to
go
the
shadows
of
the
trees
engulfed
her
foreclosing
every
possible
exit
from
the
grove
she
had
been
snared
here
by
a
vile
sensuality
that
writhed
around
her
throat
in
ever
tightening
circles
she
could
not
scream
for
even
if
a
sound
could
take
shape
within
her
parched
mouth
who
would
hear
who
would
listen
does
the
mountain
listen
pamela
groped
blindly
she
had
to
escape
she
had
to
move
in
some
direction
any
direction
that
would
take
her
away
from
this
evil
place
she
thrust
forward
through
the
shadows
and
the
trees
that
resisted
her
and
tried
to
fling
her
back
her
own
body
protested
aching
painfully
where
the
blood
in
her
veins
had
congealed
where
cold
demon
wisps
still
clung
and
caressed
every
movement
she
made
seemed
unnecessarily
noisy
twigs
cracked
loudly
under
her
feet
bushes
swished
and
scratched
at
her
slacks
tree
branches
snapped
as
she
pushed
them
ruthlessly
away
from
her
miraculously
she
found
exactly
the
right
statement
she
began
it
deliberately
so
that
none
of
her
words
would
be
lost
on
him
i
want
to
tell
you
something
thomas
demontez
lord
i
m
well
aware
that
you
ve
got
a
pedigree
as
long
as
my
leg
and
that
i
do
n
t
amount
to
anything
but
but
it
do
n
t
matter
a
tall
lord
supplied
fondly
to
me
you
ll
always
be
the
girl
o
my
dreams
an
the
sweetest
flower
that
grows
beaming
idiotically
he
pooched
out
his
lips
and
attempted
to
kiss
her
she
yanked
away
from
him
furiously
you
shut
up
shu
tt
up
pp
i
ve
got
something
to
say
to
you
and
by
god
you
re
going
to
listen
do
you
hear
me
you
re
going
to
listen
lord
nodded
agreeably
he
said
he
wanted
very
much
to
listen
he
knew
that
anything
a
brainy
little
lady
like
her
had
to
say
would
be
plumb
important
as
well
as
pleasin
to
the
ear
and
he
did
n
t
want
to
miss
a
word
of
it
so
would
she
mind
speaking
a
little
louder
i
think
you
stink
tom
lord
i
think
you
re
mean
and
hateful
and
stupid
and
louder
said
joyce
uh
huh
so
i
can
hear
you
while
i
m
checkin
the
car
looks
like
we
might
be
in
for
a
speck
of
trouble
he
opened
the
door
and
got
out
he
waited
at
the
car
side
for
a
moment
looking
down
at
her
expectantly
well
was
n
t
you
goin
to
say
somethin
then
helpfully
as
she
merely
stared
at
him
in
weary
silence
maybe
you
could
write
it
down
for
me
huh
print
it
in
real
big
letters
an
i
can
cipher
it
out
later
aah
go
on
she
said
just
go
the
hell
on
he
grinned
nodded
and
walked
around
to
the
front
of
the
car
lips
pursed
mournfully
he
stared
down
at
its
crazily
sagging
left
side
then
he
hunkered
down
on
the
heels
of
his
handmade
boots
peered
into
the
orderly
chaos
of
axle
shock
absorber
and
spring
he
went
prone
on
his
stomach
the
better
to
pursue
his
examination
after
a
time
he
straightened
again
brushing
the
red
permian
dust
from
his
hands
slapping
it
from
his
six
dollar
levis
and
his
tailored
twenty
five
dollar
shirt
he
wore
no
gun
a
strange
ommission
for
a
peace
officer
in
this
country
never
he
d
once
told
joyce
had
he
encountered
any
man
or
situation
that
called
for
a
gun
and
he
really
feels
that
way
she
thought
that
s
really
all
he
s
got
all
he
is
just
a
big
pile
of
self
confidence
in
an
almost
teensy
package
if
i
could
make
myself
feel
the
same
way
she
studied
him
hopefully
yearningly
against
the
limitless
background
of
sky
and
wasteland
it
was
easy
to
confirm
her
analysis
here
in
the
god
forsaken
place
the
westerly
end
of
nowhere
tom
lord
looked
almost
insignificant
almost
contemptible
he
was
handsome
with
his
coal
black
hair
and
eyes
his
fine
chiseled
features
but
she
d
known
plenty
of
handsomer
guys
and
conceding
his
good
looks
what
was
there
left
he
was
n
t
a
big
man
rather
on
the
medium
side
neither
was
he
very
powerful
of
build
he
could
move
very
quickly
she
knew
although
he
seldom
found
occasion
to
do
so
but
he
was
more
wiry
than
truly
strong
and
his
relatively
small
hands
and
feet
gave
him
an
almost
delicate
appearance
just
nothing
she
told
herself
just
so
darned
sure
of
himself
that
he
puts
the
indian
sign
on
everyone
but
by
gosh
i
want
him
and
i
m
going
to
have
him
he
caught
her
eye
came
back
around
the
car
with
the
boot
wearer
s
teetering
half
mincing
walk
why
did
these
yokels
still
wear
boots
anyway
when
most
had
scarcely
sat
a
horse
in
years
he
slid
in
at
her
side
tucked
a
cigar
into
his
mouth
and
politely
proffered
one
to
her
oh
cut
it
out
tom
she
snapped
ca
n
t
you
stop
that
stupid
clowning
for
even
a
minute
this
ai
n
t
your
brand
maybe
lord
suggested
or
maybe
you
just
do
n
t
feel
like
a
cigar
i
feel
like
getting
back
to
town
that
s
what
i
feel
like
now
are
you
going
to
take
me
or
am
i
supposed
to
walk
might
get
there
faster
walkin
lord
drawled
seein
as
how
i
got
a
busted
front
spring
on
the
other
hand
howsomever
maybe
you
would
n
t
either
i
figger
it
s
probl
y
a
sixty
five
mile
walk
and
i
c
n
maybe
get
this
spring
patched
up
in
a
couple
of
hours
how
with
what
there
s
nothing
out
here
but
rattlesnakes
now
ai
n
t
it
the
truth
lord
laughed
with
secret
amusement
not
a
danged
thing
but
rattlesnakes
so
i
reckon
i
ll
get
the
boss
rattler
to
help
me
tom
for
god
s
sake
looky
he
pointed
cutting
her
off
see
that
wildcat
she
saw
it
then
the
distant
derrick
of
the
wildcat
a
test
well
in
unexplored
country
and
even
with
her
limited
knowledge
of
such
things
she
knew
that
the
car
could
be
repaired
there
sufficiently
at
least
to
get
them
back
into
town
a
wildcatter
had
to
be
prepared
for
almost
any
emergency
he
had
to
depend
on
himself
since
he
was
invariably
miles
and
hours
away
from
others
well
let
s
get
going
she
said
impatiently
i
she
broke
off
frowning
what
did
you
mean
by
that
rattlesnake
gag
getting
the
boss
rattlesnake
to
help
you
why
i
meant
what
i
said
lord
declared
what
else
would
i
mean
anyways
she
looked
at
him
lips
compressed
then
with
a
shrug
of
pretended
indifference
she
took
a
compact
from
her
purse
and
went
through
the
motions
of
fixing
her
make
up
in
his
mood
it
was
the
best
way
to
handle
him
that
is
to
show
no
curiosity
whatsoever
otherwise
she
would
be
baited
into
a
tantrum
teased
and
provoked
until
she
lost
control
of
herself
and
thus
lost
still
another
battle
in
the
maddening
struggle
of
tom
lord
vs
joyce
lakewood
the
car
lurched
along
at
a
snail
s
crawl
the
left
front
mudguard
banging
and
scraping
against
the
tire
occasionally
scraping
against
the
road
itself
lord
whistled
tunelessly
as
he
fought
the
steering
wheel
he
seemed
very
pleased
with
himself
as
though
some
intricate
scheme
was
working
out
exactly
as
he
had
planned
along
with
this
self
satisfaction
however
joyce
sensed
a
growing
tension
it
poured
out
of
him
like
an
electric
current
a
feeling
that
the
muscles
and
nerves
of
his
fine
drawn
body
were
coiling
for
action
and
that
that
action
would
be
all
that
he
anticipated
joyce
had
seen
him
like
this
once
before
more
than
once
actually
but
on
one
particularly
memorable
occasion
that
was
the
day
that
he
had
practically
mopped
up
the
main
street
of
big
sands
with
aaron
mcbride
field
boss
for
the
highlands
oil
gas
company
tom
had
been
laying
for
aaron
mcbride
for
a
long
time
just
waiting
to
catch
him
out
of
line
mcbride
gave
him
his
opportunity
when
he
showed
up
in
town
with
a
pistol
on
his
hip
he
had
a
legitimate
reason
for
wearing
it
it
was
payday
for
highlands
and
he
was
packing
a
lot
of
money
back
into
the
oil
fields
moreover
as
long
as
the
weapon
was
carried
openly
the
sheriff
s
office
had
made
no
previous
issue
of
it
so
what
s
this
all
about
he
demanded
when
lord
confronted
him
i
m
not
the
only
man
in
town
with
a
gun
or
the
only
one
without
a
permit
it
was
the
wrong
thing
to
say
by
failing
to
do
as
he
was
told
instantly
to
take
out
a
permit
or
return
the
gun
to
his
car
he
had
played
into
lord
s
hands
the
trouble
was
that
he
had
virtually
had
to
protest
the
deputy
had
forced
him
to
by
his
manner
of
accosting
him
so
how
about
it
he
said
why
single
me
out
on
this
permit
deal
well
i
ll
tell
you
about
that
lord
told
him
we
aim
t
be
see
lective
y
know
do
n
t
like
to
bother
no
one
unless
we
have
to
which
i
figger
we
do
in
your
case
figger
we
got
to
be
plumb
careful
with
any
of
you
highlands
big
shots
mcbride
reddened
he
himself
had
heard
that
there
was
gangster
money
in
the
company
but
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
he
was
an
honest
man
doing
a
hard
job
and
the
implication
that
he
was
anything
else
was
unbearable
look
lord
he
said
hoarsely
i
know
you
ve
got
a
grudge
against
me
and
maybe
i
ca
n
t
blame
you
you
think
that
highlands
swindled
you
and
i
helped
em
do
it
but
you
re
all
wrong
man
i
m
no
lawyer
i
just
do
what
i
m
told
and
uh
huh
an
that
could
mean
trouble
with
a
fella
that
s
workin
for
crooks
so
you
get
rid
of
that
pistol
right
now
mis
ter
mcbride
you
do
that
or
take
you
out
a
permit
right
now
mcbride
could
n
t
do
either
of
course
not
immediately
as
the
deputy
demanded
not
without
a
face
saving
respite
of
at
least
a
few
minutes
to
do
so
would
make
his
job
well
nigh
impossible
oil
field
workers
were
a
rough
tough
lot
how
could
he
exert
authority
over
them
make
them
toe
the
line
as
he
had
to
if
he
knuckled
under
to
this
small
town
clown
i
ll
get
around
to
it
a
little
later
he
mumbled
desperately
just
as
soon
as
i
go
to
the
bank
and
huh
uh
now
mis
ter
mcbride
said
lord
and
he
laid
a
firmly
restraining
hand
on
the
field
boss
s
arm
it
was
strictly
the
deputy
s
game
but
mcbride
had
gone
too
far
to
throw
in
now
he
could
only
play
the
last
card
in
what
was
probably
the
world
s
coldest
deck
he
flung
off
lord
s
hand
and
attempted
to
push
past
him
inadvertently
shoving
him
into
a
storefront
it
was
practically
the
last
move
that
mcbride
made
of
his
own
volition
lord
slugged
him
in
the
stomach
so
hard
that
the
organ
almost
pressed
against
his
spine
then
as
he
doubled
gasping
vomiting
the
breakfast
he
had
so
lately
eaten
lord
straightened
him
with
an
uppercut
a
rabbit
punch
redoubled
him
and
then
there
was
a
numbing
blow
to
the
heart
and
another
gut
flattening
blow
to
the
stomach
but
he
could
n
t
keep
up
with
them
no
more
could
he
defend
himself
against
them
he
seemed
to
be
fighting
not
one
man
but
a
dozen
and
he
could
no
longer
think
of
face
saving
of
honor
but
only
of
escape
why
he
s
going
to
kill
me
he
thought
wildly
i
meant
him
no
harm
i
ve
given
willful
hurt
to
no
man
i
was
just
doing
my
job
just
following
orders
and
for
that
he
s
going
to
kill
me
beat
me
to
death
in
front
of
a
hundred
people
somehow
more
terrible
than
the
certainty
that
he
was
about
to
die
was
the
knowledge
that
lord
would
probably
not
suffer
for
it
the
murder
would
go
unpunished
he
mcbride
would
be
cited
as
in
the
wrong
and
he
lord
would
go
scot
free
an
officer
who
had
only
done
his
duty
though
perhaps
too
energetically
mcbride
staggered
into
the
street
flopped
sprawling
in
the
stinging
dust
fear
maddened
fleeing
the
lengthening
shadow
of
death
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
again
he
could
n
t
see
he
was
long
past
the
point
of
coherent
thinking
dimly
he
heard
laughter
hoots
of
derision
but
he
could
not
read
the
racket
properly
he
could
not
grasp
that
lord
had
withdrawn
from
the
fight
minutes
ago
and
that
his
leaden
arms
were
flailing
at
nothing
but
the
air
he
hated
them
too
much
to
understand
the
people
of
this
isolated
law
unto
itself
world
that
was
lord
s
world
this
he
was
sure
was
the
way
they
would
act
laughing
at
a
dying
man
laughing
as
a
man
was
beaten
to
death
and
nothing
would
be
done
about
it
nothing
unless
donna
donna
his
young
wife
the
girl
who
was
both
daughter
and
wife
to
him
donna
was
like
he
was
she
lived
by
the
rules
never
compromising
never
blinded
or
diverted
by
circumstance
and
donna
would
when
he
regained
consciousness
he
was
in
lord
s
house
in
the
office
of
doctor
lord
the
deputy
s
deceased
father
the
brannon
outfit
known
as
the
slash
b
because
of
its
brand
reached
hondo
creek
before
sundown
the
herd
was
watered
and
then
thrown
onto
a
broad
grass
flat
which
was
to
be
the
first
night
s
bedground
two
of
the
new
hands
a
mexican
named
jose
amado
and
a
kid
known
only
as
laredo
were
picked
for
the
first
trick
of
riding
night
herd
the
rest
of
the
crew
offsaddled
their
mounts
and
turned
them
into
the
remuda
they
got
tin
cups
of
coffee
from
the
big
pot
on
the
coosie
s
fire
rolled
and
lighted
brown
paper
cigarettes
lounged
about
there
was
some
idle
talk
a
listless
discussion
of
this
or
that
small
happening
during
the
day
s
drive
but
they
deliberately
avoided
the
one
subject
that
had
them
all
curious
the
failure
of
the
boss
s
wife
and
son
to
join
the
outfit
it
especially
bothered
the
older
hands
the
cook
mateo
garcia
had
arrived
there
long
before
the
herd
he
d
started
a
fire
and
put
coffee
on
and
now
was
busy
at
the
work
board
of
his
chuck
wagon
he
was
readying
a
batch
of
sourdough
biscuits
for
the
dutch
oven
supper
would
be
ready
within
the
hour
the
maguire
family
was
setting
up
a
separate
camp
nearby
billie
had
unhitched
the
mules
from
both
tom
brannon
s
and
his
father
s
wagon
hank
had
gathered
wood
for
a
cookfire
and
his
wife
was
busy
at
it
now
conchita
kept
an
eye
on
the
twins
and
little
elena
trying
to
keep
them
from
falling
into
the
creek
by
which
they
persisted
in
playing
conchita
nagged
at
the
younger
children
attempting
without
success
to
keep
her
thoughts
off
tom
brannon
tom
brannon
had
caught
up
with
the
outfit
shortly
after
the
maguires
joined
it
which
had
been
at
midday
he
d
come
alone
without
his
wife
and
child
he
d
been
in
an
angry
mood
conchita
had
thought
his
face
almost
ugly
with
the
anger
in
him
she
wondered
what
had
taken
place
in
town
between
him
and
his
wife
she
wished
that
she
could
talk
to
her
mother
about
it
not
that
her
mother
knew
what
had
happened
but
they
could
speculate
upon
it
but
her
mother
would
rebuke
her
if
she
mentioned
it
and
say
that
it
was
none
of
her
concern
pat
get
out
of
that
creek
you
too
sean
elena
you
ll
get
mud
all
over
your
dress
even
as
she
called
to
the
children
conchita
let
her
gaze
seek
tom
brannon
tomas
she
called
him
as
the
mexican
hands
did
he
was
in
earnest
conversation
with
her
father
and
the
old
vaquero
luis
hernandez
whatever
they
are
talking
about
conchita
wondered
it
bothered
her
that
she
probably
would
never
know
certainly
she
would
n
t
dare
ask
her
father
afterward
he
would
tell
her
not
to
pry
into
grownups
affairs
as
though
she
were
a
little
kid
like
elena
at
the
moment
the
three
men
were
not
saying
much
of
anything
they
were
sitting
on
their
heels
rider
fashion
over
by
the
still
empty
calf
wagon
brannon
was
hunkered
down
with
his
broad
back
to
the
left
rear
wheel
with
the
other
two
facing
him
he
held
a
cigarette
in
his
right
hand
it
was
burning
away
forgotten
his
face
was
clouded
with
unhappiness
he
d
told
hank
maguire
and
luis
hernandez
about
his
wife
s
refusal
to
come
with
him
and
about
what
he
now
intended
to
do
they
were
considering
it
gravely
neither
seeming
to
like
what
he
planned
finally
hernandez
said
i
could
offer
you
advice
tomas
but
you
would
n
t
heed
it
let
s
hear
it
anyway
wait
a
little
while
let
senora
brannon
live
in
her
father
s
house
for
a
time
give
her
time
to
miss
you
maybe
she
will
then
come
to
you
after
all
you
want
the
senora
as
much
as
you
want
the
boy
you
need
her
even
more
than
you
need
him
she
wo
n
t
change
her
mind
brannon
said
john
clayton
will
see
to
that
but
after
a
time
away
from
you
a
year
luis
five
ten
how
long
should
i
wait
maybe
in
a
year
tomas
in
a
year
she
ll
like
living
in
clayton
s
house
too
much
to
come
back
to
me
brannon
said
flatly
and
the
boy
will
be
too
much
under
his
influence
by
then
i
ve
got
to
take
danny
away
from
clayton
before
i
lose
him
altogether
hell
in
a
year
or
five
or
ten
the
boy
will
have
forgotten
me
his
own
father
but
to
take
him
and
leave
his
mother
behind
is
not
good
in
my
place
you
d
follow
such
advice
as
you
give
me
hernandez
looked
suddenly
uncertain
that
i
ca
n
t
answer
for
i
ca
n
t
imagine
something
like
this
happening
to
me
maybe
i
should
withdraw
my
advice
no
brannon
looked
at
hank
maguire
and
you
what
would
you
do
in
my
place
hank
shook
his
head
i
do
n
t
know
tom
like
luis
i
ca
n
t
see
something
like
this
happening
to
me
with
maria
and
me
there
s
never
any
problem
where
i
go
she
goes
and
the
kids
with
us
you
re
going
to
need
your
woman
and
the
boy
will
need
his
mother
if
you
take
the
one
you
d
better
take
both
brannon
shook
his
head
i
wo
n
t
force
beth
to
come
against
her
will
but
i
m
going
to
have
my
son
they
were
silent
for
a
little
while
each
looking
glum
finally
luis
hernandez
said
what
must
be
must
be
i
am
with
you
of
course
tomas
and
hank
maguire
added
so
am
i
tom
all
right
brannon
said
rising
we
ll
ride
out
as
soon
as
we
ve
had
chuck
brannon
timed
it
so
that
they
rode
in
an
hour
after
nightfall
they
had
for
cover
both
darkness
and
a
summer
storm
during
much
of
the
fifteen
mile
ride
they
had
watched
a
lurid
display
of
lightning
in
the
sky
to
the
east
later
they
d
heard
the
rumble
of
thunder
and
then
just
outside
rockfork
they
ran
into
rain
those
who
had
slickers
donned
them
the
others
put
on
old
coats
or
ducking
jackets
whichever
they
carried
behind
their
saddle
cantles
there
were
seven
of
them
enough
for
a
show
of
strength
to
run
a
bluff
it
was
to
be
nothing
more
than
that
there
was
to
be
no
gunplay
if
the
bluff
failed
and
they
ran
into
trouble
brannon
had
told
the
others
they
would
withdraw
and
he
would
come
after
his
son
another
time
he
did
n
t
want
to
put
himself
outside
the
law
with
him
were
hank
maguire
luis
hernandez
and
luis
s
son
pedro
the
ramirez
brothers
were
also
along
the
seventh
man
was
red
hogan
a
wiry
little
puncher
with
a
wild
streak
and
a
liking
for
hell
raising
they
were
all
good
men
it
was
dark
early
because
of
the
storm
also
because
of
the
storm
the
streets
of
rockfork
were
deserted
lighted
windows
glowed
jewel
bright
through
the
downpour
they
reined
in
before
the
town
marshal
s
office
a
box
sized
building
on
main
street
a
lamp
burned
inside
but
brannon
peering
through
the
window
saw
that
the
office
was
empty
he
d
hoped
to
catch
jesse
macklin
there
probably
just
stepped
out
he
said
maybe
to
have
supper
red
come
along
the
rest
of
you
wait
here
with
red
hogan
he
rode
to
the
welcome
cafe
hogan
got
down
from
the
saddle
and
had
a
look
inside
not
there
he
said
getting
back
onto
his
horse
maybe
he
s
at
the
hotel
they
rode
to
the
rockfork
house
a
little
farther
along
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
they
reined
in
there
brannon
remaining
in
the
saddle
while
hogan
went
to
look
for
jesse
macklin
in
the
hotel
dining
room
brannon
had
no
slicker
he
d
put
on
his
old
brown
corduroy
coat
and
it
was
already
soaked
but
he
felt
no
physical
discomfort
he
was
only
vaguely
aware
of
the
sluicing
rain
he
hardly
noticed
the
blue
green
flashes
of
lightning
and
the
hard
claps
of
thunder
hogan
reappeared
stopped
on
the
hotel
porch
lifted
a
hand
in
signal
brannon
dismounted
and
climbed
the
steps
he
s
finished
eating
hogan
said
sitting
with
a
cup
of
coffee
now
it
should
n
t
be
long
it
seemed
long
at
least
to
tom
brannon
he
and
hogan
waited
by
the
door
one
to
either
side
macklin
was
the
third
man
to
come
out
and
he
came
unhurriedly
he
was
puffing
on
a
cigar
and
he
was
turning
up
his
coat
collar
against
the
rain
it
was
not
until
he
moved
across
the
porch
that
he
became
aware
of
them
and
then
it
was
too
late
they
closed
in
fast
kept
him
from
reaching
inside
his
coat
for
his
gun
just
come
along
brannon
told
him
do
n
t
start
anything
you
ca
n
t
finish
now
listen
macklin
began
we
ll
talk
over
at
your
office
brannon
i
warn
you
let
s
go
marshal
brannon
said
and
took
him
by
the
arm
hogan
gripped
the
lawman
s
other
arm
they
escorted
him
down
from
the
porch
and
through
the
rain
to
his
office
the
other
five
slash
b
men
followed
them
inside
crowding
the
small
room
his
face
was
stiff
with
anger
when
they
let
go
of
his
arms
he
looked
at
each
of
them
in
turn
brannon
last
of
all
i
ll
remember
you
he
said
every
last
one
of
you
as
for
you
brannon
put
your
gun
on
the
desk
marshal
now
hold
on
damn
it
i
wo
n
t
red
hogan
s
patience
ran
out
he
lifted
the
skirt
of
macklin
s
coat
took
his
gun
from
its
holster
tossed
it
onto
the
desk
too
much
fooling
around
he
said
do
n
t
press
your
luck
badge
toter
brannon
said
now
the
key
to
the
lockup
marshal
key
macklin
said
what
for
ca
n
t
you
guess
brannon
said
we
re
putting
you
where
you
wo
n
t
come
to
harm
come
on
the
key
get
it
out
damned
if
i
will
brannon
you
ve
assaulted
a
law
officer
and
they
moved
in
on
him
crowded
him
from
all
sides
no
man
laid
a
hand
on
him
but
the
threat
of
violence
was
there
his
face
took
on
a
sudden
pallor
became
beaded
with
sweat
and
he
seemed
to
have
trouble
with
his
breathing
he
held
out
a
moment
longer
then
his
nerve
gave
under
the
pressure
he
swore
and
said
all
right
it
s
here
in
my
pocket
get
it
out
brannon
ordered
then
as
macklin
obeyed
now
let
s
go
out
back
resignedly
macklin
turned
to
the
back
door
they
followed
him
into
the
rain
and
across
to
the
squat
stone
building
fifty
feet
to
the
rear
the
door
of
the
lockup
was
of
oak
planks
and
banded
with
strap
iron
it
was
secured
by
an
oversized
padlock
macklin
balked
again
not
wanting
to
unlock
and
open
the
door
they
crowded
him
in
that
threatening
way
once
more
forced
him
to
give
in
once
the
door
was
open
they
crowded
him
inside
the
dark
building
he
was
uttering
threats
in
a
low
but
savage
voice
when
they
closed
and
padlocked
the
door
they
returned
to
the
street
mounted
their
horses
rode
through
the
rain
to
the
big
house
on
houston
street
its
windows
glowed
with
lamplight
deputy
marshal
luke
harper
still
stood
guard
on
the
veranda
a
forlorn
scarecrowish
figure
in
the
murky
dark
he
came
to
the
edge
of
the
veranda
peered
down
at
them
with
his
hand
on
his
gun
do
n
t
try
it
brannon
told
him
dismounting
and
starting
up
the
steps
with
his
men
following
do
n
t
get
yourself
killed
for
something
that
does
n
t
concern
you
he
strode
past
the
now
frightened
man
entered
the
house
miguel
and
arturo
ramirez
remained
on
the
veranda
to
keep
harper
from
interfering
the
others
followed
brannon
inside
they
trailed
him
across
the
wide
hallway
to
the
parlor
four
roughly
garbed
and
tough
looking
men
who
probably
had
never
before
ventured
into
such
a
house
they
brought
to
it
all
the
odors
that
clung
to
men
like
themselves
that
of
their
own
sweat
of
campfire
smoke
of
horses
and
cattle
they
tracked
mud
on
the
oaken
floor
on
the
carpet
their
presence
fouled
the
elegance
of
that
room
and
their
arrival
caught
john
clayton
and
charles
ansley
off
guard
the
author
of
the
anonymous
notes
seemed
to
be
all
knowing
for
men
who
had
left
cattle
alone
after
getting
their
first
notices
had
received
no
second
but
the
day
of
the
deadline
came
and
passed
and
the
men
who
had
scoffed
at
the
warnings
laughed
with
satisfaction
for
with
a
single
exception
nothing
had
happened
to
them
the
exception
was
an
iron
mountain
settler
named
william
lewis
after
walking
out
to
his
corral
that
morning
he
d
been
amazed
to
see
the
dust
puff
up
in
front
of
his
feet
a
split
second
later
the
distant
crack
of
a
rifle
had
sounded
he
d
mounted
up
immediately
and
raced
with
a
revolver
ready
toward
the
spot
from
which
he
d
estimated
the
shot
had
come
but
he
had
found
all
of
the
thickets
and
points
of
cover
deserted
there
had
been
no
sign
of
a
rifleman
and
no
track
or
trace
to
show
that
anyone
had
been
near
lewis
was
a
man
who
had
made
a
full
time
job
of
cow
stealing
he
had
n
t
even
pretended
to
be
farming
his
spread
his
land
had
never
been
plowed
he
had
done
his
rustling
openly
and
boasted
about
it
he
had
received
both
first
and
second
anonymous
notices
and
each
time
he
had
accused
his
neighbors
of
writing
them
he
had
cursed
at
them
and
threatened
them
he
was
a
man
those
neighbors
testified
later
who
did
n
t
have
a
friend
in
the
world
william
lewis
made
the
rounds
of
all
who
lived
near
him
again
that
august
morning
after
a
bullet
landed
at
his
feet
and
once
more
he
accused
and
threatened
everyone
i
ll
be
ready
next
time
he
raged
i
ll
be
shootin
right
back
he
had
his
chance
the
very
next
morning
for
exactly
the
same
thing
happened
again
this
time
lewis
had
his
own
rifle
in
his
hands
and
he
threw
some
answering
fire
back
at
the
mysterious
far
off
shot
then
spent
most
of
the
day
searching
out
the
area
he
found
nothing
but
he
still
refused
to
give
up
and
move
out
just
let
me
meet
up
with
that
damned
bushwhackin
coward
face
to
face
he
exploded
that
s
all
i
ask
he
never
got
that
chance
for
the
unseen
ghostlike
rifleman
aimed
a
little
higher
the
third
time
a
bullet
smashed
directly
into
the
center
of
william
lewis
chest
he
slumped
against
a
log
fence
rail
then
tried
to
lift
himself
two
more
shots
followed
in
quick
succession
dropping
him
limp
and
huddled
on
the
ground
an
inquest
was
held
and
after
a
good
deal
of
testimony
about
the
anonymous
notes
the
county
coroner
estimated
that
the
shooting
had
been
done
from
a
distance
of
yards
rumors
of
the
offer
tom
horn
had
made
at
the
stockgrowers
association
meeting
had
leaked
out
by
then
and
as
a
grand
jury
investigation
of
the
murder
got
underway
the
prosecuting
attorney
a
colonel
baird
ordered
that
the
tall
stock
detective
be
summoned
for
questioning
it
took
some
time
to
locate
horn
he
was
finally
found
in
the
bates
hole
region
of
natrona
county
two
counties
away
prosecutor
baird
immediately
assumed
he
was
hiding
out
there
after
the
shooting
and
began
preparing
an
indictment
but
that
indictment
was
never
made
for
tom
horn
it
turned
out
had
a
number
of
rancher
and
cowboy
witnesses
ready
and
willing
to
swear
with
straight
faces
that
he
had
been
in
bates
hole
the
day
of
the
killing
the
former
scout
s
alibi
could
n
t
be
shaken
the
authorities
had
to
release
him
he
immediately
rode
on
to
cheyenne
threw
a
ten
day
drinking
spree
and
dropped
some
very
strong
hints
among
friends
dead
center
at
three
hundred
yards
that
coroner
said
he
d
grin
three
shots
in
that
fella
fore
he
hit
the
ground
you
reckon
there
s
two
men
in
this
state
can
shoot
like
that
publicly
he
denied
everything
privately
he
created
and
magnified
an
image
of
himself
as
a
hired
assassin
for
a
blood
chilling
ring
of
terror
to
the
very
sound
of
his
name
was
the
tool
he
needed
for
the
job
he
d
promised
to
do
tom
horn
was
soon
back
at
work
giving
his
secret
employers
their
money
s
worth
a
good
many
beef
hungry
settlers
were
accepting
the
death
of
william
lewis
as
proof
that
the
warning
notes
were
not
idle
threats
the
company
herds
were
being
raided
less
often
and
cabins
and
soddies
all
over
the
range
were
standing
deserted
but
there
were
other
homesteaders
who
passed
the
lewis
murder
off
as
a
personal
grudge
killing
the
work
of
one
of
his
neighbors
the
rustling
problem
was
by
no
means
solved
even
in
the
very
area
where
the
shooting
had
been
done
cattle
were
still
disappearing
for
less
than
a
dozen
miles
from
the
unplowed
land
of
the
dead
man
lived
another
settler
who
had
ignored
the
warnings
that
his
existence
might
be
foreclosed
on
a
blatant
and
defiant
rustler
named
fred
powell
fred
was
mighty
crude
about
the
way
he
took
in
cattle
his
own
hired
man
andy
ross
mentioned
later
everyone
knew
it
but
he
sort
of
acted
like
he
did
n
t
care
who
knew
it
even
after
them
notes
came
even
after
he
d
heard
about
lewis
even
after
he
d
been
shot
at
a
couple
o
times
hisself
on
the
morning
of
september
powell
and
ross
rose
at
dawn
and
began
their
day
s
work
haying
time
was
close
at
hand
and
they
needed
some
strong
branches
to
repair
a
hay
rack
harnessing
a
team
to
a
buckboard
they
drove
out
to
a
willow
lined
creek
about
a
half
mile
off
then
climbed
down
and
began
chopping
andy
ross
had
just
started
swinging
an
ax
at
his
second
willow
when
the
distant
blast
of
a
rifle
sounded
he
looked
around
in
surprise
then
noticed
that
fred
powell
was
clutching
his
chest
the
hired
man
ran
over
to
help
his
boss
my
god
i
m
shot
powell
gasped
and
he
collapsed
and
died
instantly
ross
had
no
intention
of
searching
for
the
assassin
he
heaved
the
dead
man
onto
the
buckboard
yelled
and
lashed
at
the
team
and
got
out
of
there
fast
but
he
brought
back
the
sheriff
and
several
deputies
and
to
the
lawmen
the
entire
affair
seemed
a
repetition
of
the
lewis
killing
a
detailed
scouring
of
the
entire
area
revealed
nothing
beyond
a
ledge
of
rocks
that
might
have
been
the
rifleman
s
hiding
place
there
were
no
tracks
of
either
hoofs
or
boots
not
even
an
empty
cartridge
case
could
be
found
once
again
tom
horn
was
the
first
and
most
likely
suspect
and
he
was
brought
in
for
questioning
immediately
once
again
he
shook
his
head
kept
his
face
expressionless
and
his
voice
very
calm
and
had
a
strongly
supported
alibi
ready
later
riding
in
for
some
lusty
enjoyment
of
the
liquor
and
professional
ladies
of
cheyenne
he
laid
claim
to
the
killing
with
the
vague
insinuations
he
made
exterminatin
cow
thieves
is
just
a
business
proposition
with
me
he
d
blandly
announce
and
i
sort
o
got
a
corner
on
the
market
tom
a
friend
asked
him
once
how
come
you
bushwhacked
them
rustlers
they
would
n
t
o
stood
no
chance
with
you
in
a
plain
straight
out
shoot
down
he
had
lots
of
friends
then
as
always
even
as
he
became
widely
known
as
a
professional
killer
nearly
every
cowboy
and
rancher
in
wyoming
seemed
proud
to
call
him
a
friend
no
man
s
name
brought
more
cheers
when
it
was
announced
in
a
rodeo
well
he
explained
s
posin
you
was
a
nester
swingin
the
long
rope
which
would
you
be
most
scairt
of
a
dry
gulchin
or
a
shoot
down
yeah
i
can
see
that
the
friend
was
forced
to
agree
but
well
it
just
do
n
t
seem
sportin
somehow
sportin
the
tall
sunburnt
rustler
hunter
stared
in
amazement
sportin
he
echoed
again
in
soft
wonder
i
seen
a
lot
o
things
in
my
time
i
found
a
trooper
once
the
apache
had
spread
eagled
on
an
ant
hill
and
another
time
we
ran
across
some
teamsters
they
d
caught
tied
upside
down
on
their
own
wagon
wheels
over
little
fires
until
their
brains
was
exploded
right
out
o
their
skulls
i
heard
o
texas
cattlemen
wrappin
a
cow
thief
up
in
green
hides
and
lettin
the
sun
shrink
em
and
squeeze
him
to
death
but
there
s
one
thing
i
never
seen
or
heard
of
one
thing
i
just
do
n
t
think
there
is
and
that
s
a
sportin
way
o
killin
a
man
after
the
first
two
murders
the
warning
notes
were
rarely
ignored
the
lesson
had
been
learned
the
examples
were
plain
when
fred
powell
s
brother
in
law
charlie
keane
moved
into
the
dead
man
s
home
the
anonymous
letter
writer
took
no
chances
on
charlie
taking
up
where
fred
had
left
off
and
wasted
no
time
on
a
first
notice
if
you
do
n
t
leave
this
country
within
days
your
life
will
be
taken
the
same
as
powell
s
was
this
was
the
message
found
tacked
to
the
cabin
door
keane
left
within
three
days
all
through
albany
and
laramie
counties
other
men
were
doing
the
same
houses
of
settlers
who
d
treated
the
company
herds
as
a
natural
resource
free
for
the
taking
were
sitting
empty
with
weeds
growing
high
in
their
yards
the
small
half
heartedly
tended
fields
of
men
who
d
spent
more
time
rustling
cattle
than
farming
were
lying
fallow
no
cow
thief
could
count
on
a
jury
of
his
sympathetic
peers
to
free
him
any
longer
jury
judge
and
executioner
were
riding
the
range
in
the
form
of
a
single
unknown
figure
that
could
materialize
anywhere
at
any
time
to
dispense
an
ancient
brand
of
justice
the
men
of
the
new
west
had
believed
long
outdated
for
three
straight
years
tom
horn
patrolled
the
southern
wyoming
pastures
and
how
many
men
he
killed
after
lewis
and
powell
if
he
killed
lewis
and
powell
will
never
be
known
it
is
possible
although
highly
doubtful
that
he
killed
none
at
all
but
merely
let
his
reputation
work
for
him
by
privately
claiming
every
unsolved
murder
in
the
state
it
is
also
possible
but
equally
doubtful
that
he
actually
shot
down
the
hundreds
of
men
with
which
his
legend
credits
him
for
that
legend
was
growing
explosively
rumor
was
insisting
he
received
a
price
of
a
man
the
best
evidence
is
that
he
received
a
monthly
wage
of
about
very
good
money
in
an
era
when
top
hands
worked
for
and
found
rumor
had
it
he
slipped
two
small
rocks
under
each
victim
s
head
as
a
sort
of
trademark
a
detailed
search
of
old
coroner
s
reports
fails
to
substantiate
this
in
the
slightest
one
thing
was
certain
his
method
was
effective
so
effective
that
after
a
time
even
the
warning
notices
were
often
unnecessary
the
mere
fact
that
the
tall
figure
with
the
rifle
and
field
glasses
had
been
seen
riding
that
way
was
enough
to
frighten
three
rustling
homesteaders
out
of
the
upper
laramie
country
in
a
single
week
my
reputation
s
my
stock
in
trade
tom
mentioned
more
than
once
he
evidently
could
n
t
foresee
that
it
might
be
his
downfall
in
the
end
he
had
made
himself
the
personification
of
the
devil
to
the
homesteaders
but
to
the
cattlemen
who
had
been
facing
bankruptcy
from
rustling
losses
and
to
the
cowboys
who
had
been
faced
with
lay
offs
a
few
years
earlier
he
was
becoming
a
vastly
different
type
of
legendary
figure
such
ranchers
as
coble
and
clay
and
the
bosler
brothers
carried
him
on
their
books
as
a
cowhand
even
while
he
was
receiving
a
much
larger
salary
from
parties
unknown
he
made
their
spreads
his
headquarters
and
he
helped
out
in
their
roundups
in
the
cow
camps
tom
horn
was
regarded
as
a
hero
as
the
same
kind
of
champion
he
was
when
he
entered
and
invariably
won
the
local
rodeos
the
hands
and
their
bosses
saw
him
as
a
lone
knight
of
the
range
waging
a
dedicated
crusade
against
a
lawless
new
society
that
was
threatening
a
beloved
way
of
life
the
wailing
guitar
strumming
minstrels
of
the
cattle
kingdom
made
up
songs
about
him
by
rustling
losses
had
been
driven
down
to
the
lowest
level
ever
seen
in
wyoming
when
several
minutes
had
passed
and
curt
had
n
t
emerged
from
the
livery
stable
brenner
reentered
the
hotel
and
faced
summers
across
the
counter
i
have
a
little
job
for
you
charlie
i
m
sure
you
wo
n
t
mind
doing
me
a
small
favor
brenner
s
voice
was
oily
but
summers
was
n
t
fooled
he
moistened
his
lips
uneasily
what
is
it
you
want
me
to
do
mr
brenner
brenner
shrugged
carelessly
it
s
very
simple
i
just
want
you
to
take
a
message
to
diane
molinari
tell
her
to
come
here
to
the
hotel
vastly
relieved
summers
nodded
and
started
toward
the
door
one
thing
summers
brenner
said
you
re
not
to
mention
my
name
tell
her
curt
adams
wants
to
see
her
summers
pulled
up
short
and
turned
around
i
do
n
t
know
mr
brenner
he
said
haltingly
beginning
to
get
an
inkling
of
brenner
s
plans
it
does
n
t
seem
quite
right
telling
her
a
thing
like
that
could
n
t
i
just
his
voice
trailed
off
into
silence
brenner
continued
to
smile
but
his
eyes
were
cold
he
turned
and
looked
around
at
the
lobby
as
though
seeing
things
he
had
n
t
before
noticed
you
know
summers
he
said
thoughtfully
eagle
s
nest
ought
to
have
a
fire
company
if
someone
were
to
drop
a
match
in
here
this
place
would
go
up
like
a
haystack
he
started
toward
the
stairway
then
turned
to
add
tell
her
to
come
to
adams
s
room
that
adams
is
in
trouble
tell
her
to
hurry
yes
sir
his
face
pale
summers
headed
for
the
street
curt
s
visit
to
the
livery
stable
had
been
merely
a
precaution
in
case
anyone
should
be
watching
he
paused
only
long
enough
to
ascertain
that
jess
s
buckskin
was
still
missing
and
that
his
own
gray
was
all
right
then
climbed
through
a
back
window
and
dropped
to
the
ground
outside
the
fact
that
jess
s
horse
had
not
been
returned
to
its
stall
could
indicate
that
diane
s
information
had
been
wrong
but
curt
did
n
t
interpret
it
this
way
a
man
like
jess
would
want
to
have
a
ready
means
of
escape
in
case
it
was
needed
probably
his
horse
would
be
close
to
where
he
was
hiding
from
the
back
of
the
barn
it
was
a
simple
matter
to
reach
black
s
house
without
using
the
street
curt
approached
the
place
cautiously
and
watched
it
several
minutes
from
the
protection
of
a
grove
of
trees
there
was
a
light
in
black
s
front
room
but
drawn
curtains
prevented
any
view
of
the
interior
curt
circled
the
house
and
located
a
barn
out
back
he
could
hear
horses
moving
around
inside
and
nothing
else
there
was
no
lock
on
the
door
only
an
iron
hook
which
he
unfastened
he
opened
the
door
and
went
in
pulling
it
shut
behind
him
again
he
stood
in
the
darkness
listening
but
there
was
only
the
scrape
of
a
shod
hoof
on
a
plank
floor
he
moved
ahead
carefully
his
left
hand
in
front
of
him
and
came
to
a
wooden
partition
horse
smell
was
very
strong
and
he
could
hear
the
crunch
of
grain
being
ground
between
strong
jaws
he
found
a
match
in
his
pocket
and
lit
it
there
were
two
horses
in
the
barn
a
sway
backed
dun
and
jess
crouch
s
buckskin
curt
snuffed
out
the
match
it
was
certain
now
that
jess
was
in
the
house
but
also
presumably
was
stacey
black
curt
wanted
to
get
jess
alone
without
interference
from
anyone
even
as
spineless
a
person
as
the
store
owner
he
studied
the
problem
for
a
few
seconds
and
thought
of
a
means
by
which
it
might
be
solved
reaching
across
the
side
of
the
stall
he
slapped
the
buckskin
on
the
rump
the
startled
animal
let
out
a
terrified
squeal
and
thrashed
around
in
the
stall
as
curt
had
hoped
the
house
door
banged
open
he
slapped
the
buckskin
again
and
it
kicked
wildly
its
hoofs
rattling
the
side
of
the
stall
curt
moved
over
beside
the
door
and
waited
presently
he
heard
footsteps
crossing
the
yard
and
jess
s
smothered
curses
the
door
swung
open
and
jess
said
sourly
what
the
hell
s
the
matter
with
you
the
horse
continued
to
snort
curt
doubted
that
any
animal
belonging
to
jess
would
find
much
reassurance
in
its
owner
s
voice
jess
cursed
again
and
entered
the
barn
a
match
flared
and
he
reached
above
his
head
to
light
a
lantern
which
hung
from
a
wire
loop
as
he
crossed
to
the
side
of
the
stall
curt
drew
his
gun
and
clicked
back
the
hammer
before
you
try
anything
he
said
remember
what
happened
to
gruller
jess
caught
his
breath
in
surprise
he
started
to
reach
for
his
gun
but
apparently
thought
better
of
it
that
s
the
stuff
curt
said
just
hold
it
that
way
he
reached
out
to
pull
the
door
shut
and
fasten
it
with
a
sliding
bolt
you
and
i
have
a
little
talking
to
do
jess
you
wo
n
t
be
needing
this
he
moved
up
and
lifted
jess
s
pistol
out
of
its
holster
damn
you
adams
jess
was
beginning
to
recover
from
his
initial
shock
we
ai
n
t
got
nothing
to
talk
about
if
i
do
n
t
come
back
in
the
house
breed
s
going
to
your
trigger
happy

the
house

he
s
probably
having
supper
that
long
ride
the
four
of
you
took
must
ve
given
him
a
good
appetite
now
turn
around
so
i
can
see
your
face
jess
turned
there
was
raw
fury
in
his
eyes
and
the
veins
of
his
neck
were
swollen
you
re
about
as
dumb
as
they
come
adams
i
do
n
t
know
what
you
re
up
to
but
when
brenner
you
can
forget
about
brenner
too
curt
said
it
s
ben
arbuckle
we
re
going
to
talk
about
arbuckle
jess
stiffened
i
do
n
t
know
nothin
about
him
no
i
suppose
you
do
n
t
know
anything
about
a
piece
of
two
by
four
either
one
with
blood
all
over
it
arbuckle
s
blood
curt
s
fingers
put
a
little
more
pressure
on
the
trigger
of
his
gun
so
help
me
crouch
i
d
like
to
kill
you
where
you
stand
but
before
i
do
i
m
going
to
hear
you
admit
killing
him
now
start
talking
who
told
you
to
do
it
was
it
dutch
brenner
curt
was
holding
jess
s
gun
in
his
left
hand
he
drew
back
his
arm
to
slash
the
gunbarrel
across
jess
s
face
but
did
n
t
finish
the
motion
pistol
whipping
an
unarmed
man
might
come
easy
to
someone
like
jess
but
curt
could
n
t
bring
himself
to
do
it
apparently
sensing
this
and
realizing
that
it
gave
him
an
advantage
jess
became
bold
having
all
the
guns
makes
you
a
big
man
do
n
t
it
adams
if
we
was
both
armed
you
would
n
t
talk
so
tough
no
curt
reached
out
and
dropped
jess
s
pistol
back
into
the
holster
he
retreated
a
step
and
holstered
his
own
all
right
crouch
we
re
on
even
terms
now
draw
sweat
bubbled
out
on
jess
s
swarthy
face
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
twisted
into
a
claw
but
he
did
n
t
reach
for
the
gun
curt
angry
enough
to
be
a
little
reckless
raised
his
hands
shoulder
high
does
this
make
it
any
easier
coward
i
ai
n
t
drawin
against
you
jess
said
thickly
i
heard
how
you
outdrew
chico
i
ai
n
t
a
gunslinger
no
you
re
the
kind
of
bastard
who
sneaks
up
on
a
man
from
behind
and
hits
him
with
a
club
i
just
wanted
to
hear
you
say
so
jess
stared
at
him
without
answering
and
let
his
hands
fall
to
his
sides
he
had
found
curt
s
weakness
or
what
to
jess
was
a
weakness
and
was
smart
enough
to
take
advantage
of
it
somewhere
in
the
distance
a
woman
screamed
curt
was
too
involved
in
his
own
problems
to
pay
much
attention
he
had
to
make
jess
talk
and
he
had
to
do
it
before
stacey
black
got
curious
and
came
to
investigate
once
more
he
lifted
jess
s
gun
from
its
holster
only
this
time
he
tossed
it
into
the
stall
with
the
frightened
buckskin
he
dropped
his
own
beside
it
we
ll
do
it
another
way
then
he
said
harshly
jess
s
coarse
features
twisted
in
a
surprised
grin
which
was
smashed
out
of
shape
by
curt
s
fist
with
a
roar
of
pain
and
fury
jess
made
his
attack
curt
managed
to
duck
beneath
the
man
s
flailing
fist
and
drove
home
a
solid
left
to
jess
s
mid
section
it
was
like
hitting
a
sack
of
salt
pain
shout
up
curt
s
arm
clear
to
the
shoulder
but
jess
seemed
hardly
aware
that
he
had
been
hit
he
slammed
into
the
wall
bounced
back
and
caught
curt
with
a
roundhouse
right
which
sent
him
spinning
an
inch
lower
and
it
would
have
knocked
him
out
as
it
was
his
vision
blurred
and
for
a
moment
he
was
unable
to
move
when
his
eyes
began
to
focus
he
saw
jess
charging
at
him
with
a
pitchfork
curt
twisted
to
one
side
and
the
tines
of
the
fork
bit
into
the
floor
jess
wasted
a
few
seconds
trying
to
yank
them
loose
it
gave
curt
time
to
stagger
to
his
feet
the
tines
broke
off
under
jess
s
twisting
and
he
swung
the
handle
in
an
attempt
to
knock
curt
s
brains
out
his
aim
was
hurried
so
the
pitchfork
whistled
over
curt
s
head
by
now
curt
was
seeing
clearly
again
he
stepped
inside
jess
s
guard
and
landed
two
blows
to
the
big
man
s
belly
putting
everything
he
had
behind
them
they
made
jess
double
over
when
his
head
came
down
curt
grabbed
him
by
the
hair
and
catapulted
him
head
first
into
the
wall
the
building
shook
setting
the
lantern
to
swaying
and
the
buckskin
to
pitching
again
even
black
s
old
crowbait
began
to
snort
and
from
the
house
black
yelled
jess
what
s
going
on
out
there
jess
did
n
t
seem
too
sure
himself
he
lurched
drunkenly
to
his
feet
lowered
his
head
and
took
one
step
away
from
the
wall
curt
caught
him
flush
on
the
nose
with
a
blow
which
started
at
the
floor
jess
had
had
enough
blood
gushed
from
his
nose
and
he
backed
off
as
rapidly
as
he
could
stumbling
over
his
own
feet
in
his
frantic
haste
to
get
away
from
curt
s
fists
curt
was
in
almost
as
bad
shape
but
he
would
n
t
quit
he
backed
jess
into
a
corner
grabbed
a
handful
of
the
man
s
shirtfront
and
drew
back
his
right
fist
tell
me
about
arbuckle
you
killed
him
did
n
t
you
it
was
brenner
s
idea
jess
mumbled
dabbing
at
his
nose
he
found
out
about
you
and
arbuckle
talking
he
wanted
to
show
the
town
what
happened
to
anyone
who
tried
to
start
trouble
you
mean
anyone
who
stood
up
for
his
rights
curt
said
he
let
go
of
the
shirt
and
jess
slumped
to
the
floor
turning
his
back
curt
crossed
to
the
stall
reached
over
to
untie
the
buckskin
s
halter
rope
and
waved
his
hand
in
the
animal
s
face
the
buckskin
bolted
out
of
the
stall
curt
moved
in
and
picked
up
his
gun
he
shook
loose
straw
out
of
the
action
and
placed
the
gun
in
his
holster
leaving
jess
s
where
it
lay
he
left
the
stall
get
up
crouch
we
re
going
someplace
jess
painfully
got
to
his
feet
as
someone
rattled
the
door
who
s
in
there
black
called
fearfully
curt
opened
the
door
grabbed
black
by
the
shoulder
and
pulled
him
into
the
barn
you

staying
right
here
for
a
while
this
dirty
coward
just
admitted
killing
arbuckle
i
m
going
to
let
him

it
to
somebody
else
he
shoved
black
toward
the
stall
and
pointed
his
pistol
at
jess
get
out
of
here
you
re
coming
along
peacefully
or
i
ll
put
a
bullet
in
your
leg
jess
stumbled
through
the
door
curt
followed
reaching
behind
him
to
shut
the
door
and
hook
it
black
would
have
little
trouble
getting
out
but
it
might
delay
him
a
few
minutes
where
re
you
takin
me
jess
asked
worriedly
we
re
going
to
marshal
woods
s
house
maybe
if
the
marshal
hears
this
himself
it
ll
make
a
difference
somebody
in
this
town

still
have
some
backbone
over
his
shoulder
he
could
see
max
s
loose
grin
and
the
burnsides
glowering
faces

he
whispered
soon
as
we
send
them
on
their
way
and
make
camp
let

you
and

go
for
a
walk

sally
admonished
her
mother
you

got
all
evening
to
visit
with
dan
his
wounds
need
dressing
now
mrs
jackson
s
words
recalled
dan
to
his
lack
of
fitness
for
courting
what
a
spectacle
he
was
caked
with
dirt
and
sweat
and
blood
filthy
as
a
pig
and
naked
as
an
indian
kissing
the
finest
the
sweetest
the
bravest
and
absolutely
the
prettiest
girl
in
this
whole
wonderful
world
he
released
her
reluctantly
for
her
enthusiastic
reunion
with
old
hap
got
a
lot
to
tend
to
but
i
ll
get
back
quick
as
i

he
assured
her
dan
could
hear
clayton
burnside
and
eben
jackson
summing
up
their
final
reckoning
for
rental
on
the
oxen
jackson
was
doing
most
of
the
talking
so
long
as
sally
s
pa
was
coming
out
best
on
the
haggle
dan
did
n
t
feel
the
need
of
putting
in
his
two
bits
worth
soon
as
the
burnsides
moved
on
he
d
lead
rex
down
by
the
river
there
he
could
shave
and
scrub
himself
up
for
the
evening
damn
it
he
thought
bitterly
picking
up
his
shirt
and
staring
at
the
fresh
bullet
hole
in
the
sleeve
if
i
had
n
t
got
nate
stopped
when
i
did
my
duds
d
all
be
shot
plumb
to
hell
he
stooped
picked
up
his
ruined
hat
and
pursed
his
lips
thoughtfully
from
the
way
the
wound
in
his
head
was
itching
dan
knew
that
it
would
heal
but
his
only
hat
was
something
else
again
nate
nate
he
shouted
the
burnsides
now
ready
to
roll
were
purposefully
deaf
to
his
cry
nate
he
bellowed
to
the
retreating
back
directly
in
front
of
him
i
ai
n
t
going
to
fight

more
nate
turned
his
head
attempting
to
speak
in
a
soothing
voice

t

affirmed
feeling
ten
feet
tall
he
moved
in
close
jerked
the
handsome
broad
brimmed
beaver
hat
from
nate
s
head
and
clamped
it
on
his
own
here
s
a
present
for
you
he
said
shoving
his
bullet
riddled
hat
down
over
nate
s
purpling
forehead
me
and
you
s
trading
hats
so
s
you
ll
have
something
permanent
to
remember
me
by
sally
left
her
choring
to
stand
beside
dan
slipping
her
hand
in
his
they
silently
watched
the
burnsides
make
the
bend
in
the
road
and
disappear
from
sight
much
as
they
had
to
look
forward
to
they
did
n
t
begrudge
a
moment
of
the
time
they
spent
seeing
them
go
at
first
matilda
could
not
believe
her
own
eyes
she
had
spent
too
many
hours
looking
ahead
hoping
and
longing
to
catch
even
a
glimpse
of
dan
and
finding
nothing
but
emptiness
and
now
she
could
see
him
looking
uncommon
handsome
standing
there
beside
sally
jackson
and
her
folks
in
front
of
their
trail
worn
wagon
seeing
them
waiting
there
at
the
foot
of
emigrant
rock
was
so
overwhelming
that
for
a
good
minute
after
they
rounded
the
bend
and
started
down
the
grade
leading
toward
them
matilda
could
not
speak
at
all
then
with
a
glory
that
almost
wiped
out
the
deep
downward
sags
in
her
careworn
face
matilda
leaned
over
the
wheel
and
shouted
to
hez
who
was
stumbling
along
in
the
heat
and
the
dust
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
wagon
pa
pa
i
can
see
dan
and
he
s
with
the
jacksons
what
about
burnsides
hez
asked
who
still
believed
they
d
have
them
to
lick
they
ai
n
t
even
in
sight
she
replied
by
then
hez
could
see
for
himself
and
so
could
the
others
soon
they
were
all
shouting
greetings
exchanging
smiles
and
rejoicing
to
think
that
they
were
all
back
together
again
but
even
a
reunion
as
joyous
as
this
one
did
not
make
a
break
in
the
routines
of
the
day
nor
could
they
stop
and
find
out
about
all
that
had
happened
until
they
made
circle
tended
the
cattle
tethered
the
horses
gathered
fuel
carried
water
and
started
their
cooking
fires
then
and
only
then
with
the
jacksons
and
dan
as
their
true
guests
of
honor
did
the
harrows
take
time
to
catch
up
on
the
news
no
sooner
did
they
hear
of
dan
s
injury
than
both
gran
and
matilda
went
into
immediate
action
the
wound
in
his
scalp
was
examined
pronounced
healing
and
well
doctored
with
simples
before
they
dished
up
the
victuals
from
then
on
in
keeping
with
the
traditions
they
had
followed
since
childhood
the
whole
group
settled
down
to
relish
their
food
even
sally
in
spite
of
her
gaiety
and
obvious
welcome
followed
the
old
taboo
of
quitting
the
gab
when
wearing
the
nosebag
after
their
supper
the
evening
turned
into
a
regular
hoe
down
only
they
carefully
substituted
old
country
folk
dances
for
the
virginia
reels
and
square
dances
that
were
so
popular
among
more
worldly
trains
in
the
great
westward
migration
but
with
bill
o
connor
on
the
fiddle
and
gran
harrow
exuberantly
shouting
glory
be
and
hallelujah
above
their
united
chant
of
the
lilting
old
ballads
they
played
their
quaint
folk
games
with
all
the
fervor
and
abandon
of
a
real
celebration
golly
rod
exclaimed
to
harmony
as
he
dutifully
stood
by
her
side
among
the
ringed
spectators

gave
her
a
warm
pat
on
the

before
he
replied

kicking
up
your
heels
and
feeling
coltish
again
too
gal
at
these
words
of
sympathy

generously

settled
on
the
edge
of
the
grub
box
to
ease
the
pressure
of
her
swollen
body
on
her
bone
weary
legs
and
worried
about
all
that
might
have
happened
to
sally

she
was
deeply

that
she
could

dell
at
the
sight
of
sally
s
happy
face
and
carefree
expression
harmony
s
dark
brooding
eyes
quickly
brightened
with
unshed
tears
she
was
glad
completely
and
unselfishly
glad
to
see
that
things
were
working
out
the
right
way
for
both
sally
and
dan
and
she
really
tried
to
go
a
step
further
and
say
she
hoped
they
d
be
just
as
right
as
they
now
were
for
her
and
for
rod
but
she
could
n
t
not
yet
not
with
the
memory
of
her
folks
and
the
lost
conestoga
still
holding
her
close
out
in
the
center
of
the
circle
the
farmer
who
was
dan
wasted
no
time
when
they
came
to
the
line
the
farmer
choose
his
wife
with
a
swift
swoop
of
his
big
arms
he
grabbed
sally
out
of
the
circle
surrounding
him
and
then
kissed
her
soundly
before
setting
her
down
so
she
could
stand
by
his
side
while
they
jointly
chose
the
rest
of
their
outfit
soon
the
child
the
dog
the
cat
and
even
the
cheese
all
joined
them
out
there
in
the
circle
by
now
harmony
could
see
that
most
of
the
adults
in
the
train
were
winded
and
resting
or
else
siphoned
off
from
the
games
by
the
challenging
lure
of
the
great
cliff
towering
above
them
no
matter
how
many
registry
rocks
they
came
to
on
this
journey
each
one
exerted
its
own
appeal
even
strange
names
seemed
to
make
them
feel
closer
to
some
kind
of
civilization
when
stumbled
across
out
here
in
this
wilderness
already
a
few
hardy
folk
from
their
own
train
were
zealously
chipping
away
at
the
register
rocks
leaving
their
own
records
along
with
those
made
by
the
earlier
trains
soon
she
saw
rod
and
hez
moving
over
to
join
them
no
sooner
were
they
through
and
the
guards
posted
than
the
whole
camp
turned
in
for
a
night
of
sound
sleep
for
matilda
it
was
the
first
she
had
known
in
many
a
night
even
the
knowledge
that
she
was
losing
another
boy
as
a
mother
always
does
when
a
marriage
is
made
did
not
prevent
her
from
having
the
first
carefree
dreamless
sleep
that
she
had
known
since
they
dropped
down
the
canyon
and
into
bear
valley
way
way
back
there
when
they
were
crossing
those
other
mountains
next
morning
they

on
again

watching

up

dan
released
their
holds
on
the
arms
of
her
hickory
rocker
and
exchanged
embarrassed
grins

said
almost
in

that

by

out

this

town
had
the
appearance
of
being

busier
and
more
prosperous
men
crowded
the
streets
and
freight
rigs
and
teams
were
moving
about
although
they
were
forced
to
maintain
a
sharper
watch

activity

to
ride
in
and

their
broncs

if

declared
glancing
along
the
street
as
they
stretched
their
legs
there
were
no
less
than
six
or
seven
saloons
in
ganado
not
counting
the
lower
class
dives
all
vying
for
the
trade
of
celebrating

and

of

and
i

take

proposed
if
you

a
yell
before
you

in
cobb
s
assent
was
tight
you
do
the
same
it
s
all
i
ask
stevens
separating
they
took
different
sides
of
the
main
drag
and
systematically
combed
the
bars
russ
visited
two
places
without
result
and
his
blood
pressure
was
down
to
zero
suddenly
it
seemed
to
him
insane
that
they
might
hope
to
locate
gyp
carmer
so
casually
even
were
he
to
prove
the
thief
he
tramped
out
of
the
miners
rest
with
his
hopes
plummeting
and
headed
doggedly
for
the
palace
saloon
the
last
place
of
any
consequence
on
this
side
of
the
street
the
palace
was
an
elaborate
establishment
built
practically
on
stilts
in
front
with
long
flights
of
wooden
steps
running
up
to
the
porch
behind
its
ornate
facade
the
notorious
dive
clung
like
a
bird
s
nest
to
the
rocky
ribs
of
the
canyonside
russ
ran
up
the
steps
quickly
to
the
plank
porch
the
front
windows
of
the
place
were
long
and
narrow
reaching
nearly
to
the
floor
and
affording
an
unusually
good
view
of
the
interior
heading
for
the
batwings
cobb
glanced
perfunctorily
through
the
nearest
window
and
suddenly
dodged
aside
nerves
tight
as
a
bowstring
he
paused
to
gather
his
wits
against
all
expectation
carmer
was
inside
clearly
enjoying
himself
to
the
hilt
and
already
so
tipsy
that
it
seemed
unlikely
he
was
bothering
to
note
anything
or
anyone
about
him
fierce
anger
surged
through
russ
he
fought
down
the
impulse
to
rush
in
and
collar
the
vicious
puncher
on
the
spot
reaching
the
porch
rail
beyond
view
of
the
bar
windows
he
feverishly
scanned
the
busy
street
below
stevens
was
nowhere
in
sight
muffling
an
exclamation
russ
sprang
to
the
nearest
steps
and
ran
down
as
luck
had
it
he
had
not
gone
twenty
feet
in
the
street
before
pat
appeared
what
luck
cobb
he
said
swiftly
russ
pointed
upward
he
s
there
he
got
out
tersely
curbing
his
rising
excitement
hitching
his
cartridge
belt
around
pat
glanced
upward
briefly
at
the
palace
and
started
that
way
with
cobb
at
his
side
climbing
the
steps
steadily
they
reached
the
top
and
headed
for
the
door
pat
pushed
through
first
forced
behind
him
momentarily
russ
followed
at
once
and
halted
two
steps
inside
his
eyes
widened
while
five
minutes
ago
the
place
had
presented
a
scene
of
easy
revelry
with
gyp
carmer
a
prominent
figure
it
was
now
as
somnolent
and
dull
as
the
day
before
payday
carmer
himself
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
a
man
knocked
the
roulette
ball
about
idly
in
its
track
and
another
dozed
at
one
of
the
card
tables
two
men
murmured
with
their
heads
together
at
the
end
of
the
bar
while
the
sleek
headed
bartender
absently
polished
a
glass
looking
the
setup
over
stevens
started
coolly
for
the
rear
of
the
place
where
yuh
goin
it
was
the
barkeep
halting
pat
turned
to
survey
him
deliberately
he
did
not
reply
going
on
toward
the
back
less
assured
than
the
tall
wide
shouldered
man
in
the
lead
cobb
followed
alertly
a
hand
on
his
gun
butt
the
bartender
measured
this
situation
with
heavy
eyes
and
decided
he
wanted
no
part
of
it
he
said
no
more
a
hall
opened
in
back
of
the
bar
running
toward
an
ell
pat
moved
into
it
small
rooms
probably
for
cards
opened
off
on
either
side
all
the
doors
were
open
at
this
hour
except
one
and
it
was
toward
this
that
stevens
made
his
way
with
russ
close
at
his
shoulder
the
door
was
locked
a
single
kick
made
it
spring
open
shuddering
pat
saw
gyp
carmer
staggering
forward
a
half
filled
bottle
upraised
as
if
to
strike
russ
sprang
through
to
bat
it
nimbly
aside
with
a
bellow
carmer
lunged
at
him
but
he
was
more
than
half
drunk
and
his
faculties
were
dulled
cobb
unleashed
a
single
powerful
jab
that
sent
gyp
reeling
wildly
and
crashing
down
with
a
whining
groan
he
started
to
struggle
up
heaving
desperately
russ
gave
him
a
brutal
thrust
that
tumbled
him
over
flat
on
his
stomach
kneeling
cobb
planted
a
sturdy
knee
in
the
small
of
his
back
holding
him
pinned
okay
stevens
i
ve
drawn
his
fangs
he
snapped
go
through
his
pockets
will
you
if
we
have
to
we
ll
take
him
apart
and
see
what
he
s
made
of
complying
methodically
pat
pulled
pocket
after
pocket
inside
out
without
finding
a
thing
cobb
watched
this
with
hunted
eyes
his
desperate
hope
waning
by
the
moment
stevens
was
grunting
over
the
last
empty
pocket
when
russ
abruptly
rose
and
lunged
toward
carmer
s
hat
which
had
tumbled
half
a
dozen
feet
away
when
he
first
fell
cobb
got
it
straightening
up
his
eyes
ablaze
he
held
out
the
battered
stetson
look
at
this
inside
the
crown
stuffed
behind
the
stained
sweatband
could
be
seen
thin
crumpled
wads
of
currency
carmer
s
ingenious
cache
for
his
loot
had
been
found
by
golly
stevens
you
were
right
russ
exclaimed
tearing
the
loose
bills
out
of
carmer
s
hat
that
is
if
we
can
be
sure
this
is
colcord
s
money
pat
grunted
where
else
would
he
get
it
count
what
you
ve
got
there
cobb
we
can
soon
tell
russ
ran
through
the
bills
and
named
an
amount
it
was
highly
unlikely
any
cowpuncher
would
come
by
honestly
pat
nodded
it
s
within
a
hundred
of
what
crip
had
he
declared
we
know
penny
spent
some
and
carmer
must
have
dropped
a
few
dollars
getting
that
load
on
handing
the
money
over
russ
wiped
his
hands
on
his
pants
legs
as
if
ridding
himself
of
something
unclean
his
glance
at
gyp
carmer
was
disdainful
shall
we
get
out
of
here
leaving
the
card
room
they
moved
back
through
the
palace
the
way
they
had
come
glowering
looks
met
them
in
the
bar
but
there
was
no
attempt
to
halt
them
pausing
in
the
outside
door
to
glance
behind
him
pat
looked
his
unspoken
warning
and
stepped
out
he
and
cobb
clattered
down
the
high
steps
to
the
street
neither
spoke
till
they
reached
their
horses
pat
paused
there
looking
across
at
the
young
fellow
it
ll
be
a
pleasure
for
you
to
return
this
money
to
colcord
and
tell
him
about
it
russ
he
started
to
return
it
to
his
faint
surprise
russ
held
up
his
hand
not
me
he
ruled
decidedly
i
ve
had
enough
it
was
you
that
tracked
it
down
anyway
stevens
he
pursued
strictly
i
ll
shove
along
home
whatever
you
say
pat
swung
into
the
saddle
yet
still
he
delayed
his
brows
puckered
you
owe
it
to
penny
to
give
her
a
chance
to
explain
that
she
was
defending
you
really
he
observed
mildly
old
crip
was
n
t
retorted
cobb
tartly
he
ll
know
when
you
tell
him
but
i
want
this
to
sink
in
awhile
then
maybe
next
time
he
wo
n
t
be
so
quick
on
the
trigger
pat
had
never
pretended
to
give
advice
in
such
affairs
you
re
the
doctor
he
returned
with
a
smile
but
i
still
think
penny
s
an
awful
nice
girl
russ
you
do
n
t
have
to
tell
me
flashed
cobb
giving
the
other
a
dark
look
he
hauled
his
bronc
around
and
trotted
down
off
the
street
pat
let
him
go
following
more
leisurely
at
the
first
restaurant
he
sensibly
pulled
up
to
go
in
for
his
dinner
and
as
a
consequence
did
not
see
cobb
strike
the
open
range
at
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
and
head
straight
across
the
swells
for
antler
the
truth
was
the
puncher
was
both
bewildered
and
dismayed
by
his
own
mixed
luck
penny
s
always
glad
to
see
me
over
there
he
mused
bleakly
yet
had
he
not
visited
the
girl
at
saw
buck
he
would
never
have
been
involved
in
this
latest
tangle
over
and
above
that
however
was
his
growing
suspicion
of
chuck
stober
s
part
in
recent
events
gyp
carmer
could
n
t
have
known
about
colcord
s
money
unless
he
was
told
and
who
else
would
have
told
him
he
asked
himself
it
s
the
second
time
war
ax
hands
made
a
play
for
that
money
how
much
of
an
accident
could
that
be
nearing
home
he
jerked
to
attention
at
the
distant
crack
of
a
gun
in
town
no
one
paid
much
attention
to
an
occasional
shot
but
on
the
range
gunfire
had
a
meaning
hauling
up
russ
listened
carefully
two
minutes
later
it
came
again
a
double
explosion
followed
by
a
third
sounding
more
distant
as
near
as
cobb
could
determine
the
shots
came
from
the
direction
of
the
antler
ranch
house
he
tightened
up
in
a
twinkling
so
far
as
he
knew
only
his
father
could
be
there
what
did
it
mean
clapping
spurs
to
the
bronc
he
set
off
at
a
sharp
canter
with
growing
alarm
his
first
glimpse
of
the
ranch
house
across
the
brushy
swells
told
him
nothing
still
a
quarter
mile
away
the
fresh
clap
of
guns
only
served
to
increase
his
speed
setting
a
course
straight
for
the
house
he
was
covering
ground
fast
when
an
angry
bee
buzzed
past
close
to
his
face
when
it
was
followed
by
a
second
whining
even
closer
cobb
swerved
sharply
aside
into
a
depression
he
knew
now
what
he
was
up
against
whoever
was
out
there
hiding
in
the
brushy
cover
was
besieging
the
antler
house
and
having
spotted
his
approach
was
determined
to
drive
him
off
before
he
could
get
into
the
fight
cursing
himself
for
having
ridden
out
the
last
few
days
without
a
rifle
in
his
saddle
boot
russ
drew
his
colt
and
examined
it
briefly
if
he
wondered
whether
the
attackers
would
allow
him
to
pull
away
unmolested
he
had
his
answer
a
moment
later
over
this
way
he
ai
n
t
gone
far
a
harsh
cry
floated
to
him
across
the
brush
a
carbine
cracked
more
loudly
and
a
slug
clipped
fragments
from
the
brush
off
at
one
side
the
would
be
assassin
had
his
position
figured
pretty
close
dismounting
russ
looked
about
hastily
toward
the
west
this
depression
led
toward
a
draw
leading
his
pony
he
hurried
that
way
not
remounting
till
he
was
well
below
the
level
of
the
surrounding
range
swinging
up
then
and
bending
forward
over
the
horn
he
urged
his
mount
down
the
meandering
draw
he
had
not
covered
a
hundred
yards
before
a
gun
crashed
from
somewhere
behind
he
had
been
sighted
and
his
attacker
pumping
shot
after
shot
a
shot
or
two
went
wild
before
cobb
felt
something
tug
at
his
foot
a
slug
had
torn
half
of
his
stirrup
guard
away
a
second
twitched
his
shirtsleeve
and
he
felt
a
brief
burn
on
his
upper
arm
another
snarled
close
overhead
jumping
jerusalem
let
s
get
out
of
here
at
the
first
shot
russ
had
hurled
his
mount
to
the
left
toward
the
side
of
the
winding
draw
the
long
minute
before
he
reached
effective
cover
seemed
endless
sweeping
a
look
around
he
saw
that
he
was
safe
for
the
moment
he
heard
cries
from
behind
him
but
he
could
make
out
no
words
he
dashed
madly
for
the
next
elbow
turn
in
the
draw
and
made
it
recklessly
hurling
the
bronc
sidewise
into
an
intersecting
draw
he
plunged
forward
with
undiminished
speed
gradually
the
wash
climbed
upward
forcing
him
toward
open
range
yet
he
must
chance
it
he
clambered
out
of
the
dwindling
wash
the
loose
dirt
flying
behind
him
and
flashed
a
look
about
early
in
november
the
clouds
lifted
enough
to
carry
out
the
assigned
missions
and
sweeney
squadron
put
its
first
marks
on
the
combat
record
every
plane
that
could
fly
was
sent
into
the
air
cricket
took
eight
ships
and
went
south
across
the
straits
and
along
the
north
coast
of
mindanao
to
cagayan
anything
the
enemy
flew
or
floated
was
his
target
fleischman
with
eight
was
to
patrol
the
leyte
gulf
area
with
his
main
task
to
get
any
kamikaze
before
they
got
to
the
ships
greg
himself
took
two
flights
with
todman
leading
the
second
to
patrol
and
look
for
targets
of
opportunities
around
ormoc
on
the
east
coast
of
leyte
each
plane
carried
two
five
hundred
pound
bombs
a
weapons
carrier
took
greg
todman
belton
banjo
ferguson
and
walters
and
the
others
the
two
miles
from
the
bivouac
area
to
the
strip
it
was
a
rough
long
ride
through
the
mud
and
pot
holes
no
one
had
much
to
say
the
sky
glowered
down
at
them
there
was
a
feeling
that
this
mission
would
be
canceled
like
all
the
others
and
that
this
muddy
wet
dark
world
of
combat
would
go
on
forever
the
truck
dropped
them
off
at
the
various
revetments
spread
through
the
jungle
donovan
snatched
greg
s
chute
from
him
with
a
belligerent
motion
and
almost
ran
to
the
plane
with
it
his
face
was
dark
as
the
sky
above
it
as
he
stood
on
the
wing
and
waited
for
his
pilot
greg
climbed
into
the
cockpit
feeling
as
if
he
had
never
been
in
one
before
but
his
hands
and
those
of
donovan
moved
automatically
adjusting
and
arranging
in
the
check
out
procedure
i
ve
got
her
as
neat
as
i
can
donovan
said
as
he
dropped
the
straps
of
the
seton
harness
over
greg
s
shoulders
but
this
goddamn
climate
it
s
for
carabao
not
airplanes
we
ll
make
out
do
n
t
you
worry
chief
greg
replied
wondering
if
he
himself
believed
it
yeah
see
you
donovan
said
as
he
jumped
off
the
wing
the
expression
was
his
trade
mark
his
open
sesame
to
good
luck
and
his
prayer
that
pilot
and
plane
would
always
return
at
the
prearranged
time
greg
started
the
engine
and
taxied
out
from
the
time
the
chocks
were
pulled
until
the
plane
was
out
of
sight
he
knew
donovan
would
keep
his
back
to
the
strip
he
wondered
where
the
superstition
had
originated
that
it
was
bad
luck
for
a
crew
chief
to
watch
his
plane
take
off
on
a
combat
mission
yet
long
before
the
scheduled
time
for
return
donovan
would
be
watching
for
every
speck
in
the
sky
greg
rumbled
down
the
rough
metal
taxi
strip
and
one
by
one
the
seven
members
of
his
flight
fell
in
behind
him
the
dark
brown
bombs
hanging
under
each
wing
looked
large
and
powerful
the
pilots
heads
looked
ridiculously
small
the
control
tower
gave
him
immediate
take
off
permission
and
the
clean
roar
of
the
engine
that
took
him
off
the
rough
strip
spoke
well
of
the
skill
of
donovan
greg
s
mission
was
the
last
to
leave
and
as
he
circled
the
ships
off
tacloban
he
saw
the
clouds
were
dropping
down
again
to
the
west
the
dark
green
hills
of
leyte
were
lost
in
the
clouds
about
halfway
up
their
slopes
underneath
him
the
sea
was
a
dark
and
muddied
gray
water
splashed
against
his
windshield
as
he
led
the
flight
in
and
out
of
showers
the
metal
strip
they
had
taken
off
from
was
coal
black
against
the
green
jungle
around
it
he
possessed
the
fighter
pilot
s
horror
of
bad
weather
and
instrument
flying
and
he
wondered
if
the
ceiling
did
drop
whether
he
and
the
other
flights
would
be
able
to
find
their
way
back
in
this
unfamiliar
territory
he
shivered
in
the
warm
cockpit
the
overcast
was
solid
above
him
as
far
as
he
could
see
there
was
no
hole
to
climb
through
it
they
would
have
to
go
west
through
the
narrow
river
valley
that
separated
leyte
from
samar
and
hope
that
it
did
n
t
close
in
before
they
returned
greg
pushed
the
radio
button
on
his
throttle
todman
let
s
try
to
go
under
this
stuff
stay
in
close
and
we
ll
go
up
the
valley
roger
sweeney
todman
called
back
and
pulled
his
four
in
and
slightly
above
greg
greg
took
the
formation
wide
around
three
a
attack
bombers
that
were
headed
north
over
the
gulf
he
dropped
down
to
five
hundred
feet
swinging
a
little
north
of
the
city
of
tacloban
and
punched
into
the
opening
that
showed
against
the
mountain
the
valley
was
only
a
few
hundred
yards
wide
with
just
about
room
enough
for
a
properly
performed
hundred
and
eighty
degree
turn
it
was
only
a
fifteen
minute
flight
but
before
it
was
through
greg
felt
himself
developing
a
case
of
claustrophobia
the
ceiling
stayed
solid
above
them
at
about
eight
hundred
feet
and
at
times
the
sheer
cliffs
seemed
about
to
close
in
if
the
other
pilots
were
worried
they
did
not
show
it
the
formation
remained
perfect
when
the
sea
was
visible
ahead
of
them
the
relief
was
as
great
as
if
the
sun
had
come
out
he
spread
the
flight
out
and
led
them
across
a
point
of
land
and
then
down
the
coast
although
they
drew
light
ground
fire
they
saw
no
signs
of
activity
once
todman
thought
he
had
spotted
a
tank
and
went
down
to
investigate
while
greg
covered
him
somebody
beat
us
to
it
todman
said
over
the
radio
as
he
came
back
up
in
formation
visibility
continued
to
be
limited
and
greg
was
never
able
to
get
above
a
thousand
feet
it
was
frustrating
his
earphones
were
constantly
full
of
the
sounds
of
enemy
contacts
made
by
other
flights
he
thought
once
that
he
identified
the
somewhat
hysterical
voice
of
fleischman
claiming
a
kill
but
greg
s
area
remained
as
placid
as
a
florida
dawn
finally
as
time
began
to
run
out
he
headed
into
ormoc
and
glide
bombed
a
group
of
houses
that
intelligence
had
thought
might
contain
japanese
supplies
the
low
clouds
made
bombing
difficult
there
was
not
enough
room
to
make
the
usual
vertical
bomb
run
the
accuracy
was
deplorable
one
of
greg
s
bombs
hung
up
and
he
was
miles
from
the
target
before
he
could
get
rid
of
it
only
one
of
the
flight
scored
a
direct
hit
and
the
rest
blew
up
jungle
with
their
load
of
bombs
gone
the
planes
moved
swiftly
and
easily
greg
went
up
tight
against
the
ceiling
and
led
them
back
to
their
pass
to
home
mercifully
it
was
still
open
like
a
man
making
a
deep
dive
greg
took
full
breath
and
plunged
back
into
the
valley
he
was
about
to
make
a
gas
check
on
his
flight
when
todman
s
voice
broke
in
sweeneys
three
bogies
twelve
o
clock
level
greg
s
eyes
flicked
up
from
his
instrument
panel
he
saw
them
specks
against
the
gray
but
closing
fast
they
were
headed
straight
for
each
other
on
a
collision
course
friend
or
enemy
the
same
old
question
and
only
a
few
seconds
to
answer
it
zeros
todman
said
excitedly
and
hopefully
and
then
he
thought
todman
might
be
right
his
mind
flicked
through
the
mental
pictures
he
had
from
the
hours
of
aircraft
identification
he
narrowed
the
shape
down
to
two
either
a
zero
or
a
u
s
navy
type
aircraft
if
it
were
the
enemy
tactically
his
position
was
correct
japanese
aircraft
were
strong
on
maneuverability
american
on
speed
and
firepower
his
present
maximum
altitude
up
against
the
overcast
gave
him
the
opportunity
to
exploit
his
advantages
but
it
also
made
him
conspicuous
to
the
enemy
if
it
was
the
enemy
and
he
had
n
t
been
spotted
already
but
the
closing
aircraft
showed
no
sign
of
deviating
from
their
original
course
in
seconds
greg
made
his
decision
he
pushed
the
radio
button
sweeney
blue
hit
the
deck
lots
of
throttle
todman
you
take
the
one
on
the
left
i
ll
take
the
middle
belton
the
one
on
the
right
if
if
they
re
japs
let
s
make
sure
first
greg
had
the
stick
forward
and
the
throttle
up
before
he
heard
the
two
rogers
the
planes
light
with
most
of
the
gas
burned
out
responded
beautifully
greg
s
airspeed
indicator
was
over
when
he
leveled
off
just
above
the
trees
the
opposing
aircraft
continued
to
come
on
they
appeared
to
be
the
enemy
greg
wished
the
air
corps
had
continued
to
camouflage
planes
there
was
of
course
no
way
for
the
other
planes
to
get
by
them
it
was
a
box
but
they
could
turn
and
escape
to
the
east
greg
pushed
the
radio
button
again
todman
drop
your
second
element
back
if
any
of
us
miss
they
can
pick
up
the
pieces
now
let
s
make
sure
they
re
japs
even
as
he
said
it
greg
knew
they
had
found
the
enemy
the
shapes
were
unmistakable
and
the
rising
suns
were
showing
up
slightly
brighter
pinpoints
in
the
gray
gloom
greg
slapped
his
hand
across
the
switches
that
turned
on
the
guns
and
gun
camera
and
gun
sight
the
circle
with
the
dot
in
the
center
showed
up
yellow
on
the
reflector
glass
in
front
of
him
his
hands
shook
arm
your
guns
sweeneys
they
re
japs
they
re
japs
came
a
high
pitched
voice
greg
to
sweeney
blue
one
pass
only
no
turns
you
ll
bust
your
ass
in
this
canyon
that
s
an
order
he
moved
the
flights
over
against
one
wall
it
gave
them
all
a
chance
to
make
a
high
speed
climbing
turn
attack
and
a
break
away
that
would
not
take
them
into
the
overcast
or
force
a
tight
turn
recovery
if
the
turn
was
too
tight
a
barrel
roll
would
bring
them
out
a
hell
of
an
altitude
for
a
barrel
roll
but
it
could
be
done
greg
slammed
his
throttle
to
the
fire
wall
and
rammed
up
the
rpm
and
the
engine
responded
as
if
it
had
been
waiting
the
clearly
identifiable
enemy
continued
on
as
if
no
one
else
were
around
they
have
n
t
seen
us
greg
yelled
to
himself
over
the
engine
noise
they
have
n
t
seen
us
he
hit
the
radio
button
now
sweeneys
now
let
s
take
em
home
he
hauled
back
on
the
stick
and
felt
his
cheeks
sag
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
watched
his
wingman
move
out
a
bit
and
shoot
up
with
him
perfect
he
thought
with
the
rapid
rate
of
closure
the
approach
from
below
the
side
and
ahead
there
would
be
only
a
moment
when
damage
could
be
done
just
like
shooting
at
a
duck
while
performing
a
half
gainer
from
a
diving
board
he
tightened
his
turn
his
nose
up
it
was
going
to
be
dangerous
eight
aircraft
in
this
small
box
please
dear
god
make
my
pilots
good
he
prayed
he
took
a
lead
on
the
enemy
using
a
distance
of
five
of
the
radii
in
his
circular
sight
and
then
added
another
the
enemy
did
not
veer
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
they
had
n
t
been
spotted
blind
fools
now
greg
s
fingers
closed
on
the
stick
trigger
the
plane
rumbled
and
slowed
six
red
lines
etched
their
way
into
the
gray
and
vanished
as
if
drawn
by
a
wire
the
enemy
flew
into
them
greg
tightened
his
turn
until
the
plane
shuddered
luck
was
with
him
his
burst
held
for
a
second
on
the
engine
section
of
the
plane
the
jap
s
propeller
flew
off
in
pieces
a
large
piece
of
engine
cowling
vanished
it
was
all
greg
had
time
to
see
his
maneuvering
for
the
shot
had
placed
him
near
the
overcast
almost
inverted
and
heading
up
into
the
clouds
his
speed
was
dropping
rapidly
if
he
spun
out
now
he
would
join
his
opponent
on
the
ground
wingman
stay
clear
he
prayed
he
pushed
stick
and
rudder
and
entered
the
overcast
on
his
back
he
fought
the
panic
of
vertigo
he
had
no
idea
which
was
up
and
which
was
down
he
held
the
controls
where
they
had
been
sweat
popped
out
over
him
and
he
felt
the
slick
between
his
palm
and
the
stick
grip
his
air
speed
dropped
until
he
thought
he
would
spin
out
too
many
people
think
that
the
primary
purpose
of
a
higher
education
is
to
help
you
make
a
living
this
is
not
so
for
education
offers
all
kinds
of
dividends
including
how
to
pull
the
wool
over
a
husband
s
eyes
while
you
are
having
an
affair
with
his
wife
if
it
were
not
for
an
old
professor
who
made
me
read
the
classics
i
would
have
been
stymied
on
what
to
do
and
now
i
understand
why
they
are
classics
those
who
wrote
them
knew
people
and
what
made
people
tick
i
worked
for
my
uncle
an
uncle
by
marriage
so
you
will
not
think
this
has
a
mild
undercurrent
of
incest
who
ran
one
of
those
antique
shops
in
new
orleans
vieux
carre
the
old
french
quarter
the
arrangement
i
had
with
him
was
to
work
four
hours
a
day
the
rest
of
the
time
i
devoted
to
painting
or
to
those
other
activities
a
young
and
healthy
man
just
out
of
college
finds
interesting
i
had
a
one
room
studio
which
overlooked
an
ancient
courtyard
filled
with
flowers
and
plants
blooming
everlastingly
in
the
southern
sun
i
had
come
to
new
orleans
two
years
earlier
after
graduating
college
partly
because
i
loved
the
city
and
partly
because
there
was
quite
a
noted
art
colony
there
when
my
uncle
offered
me
a
part
time
job
which
would
take
care
of
my
normal
expenses
and
give
me
time
to
paint
i
accepted
the
arrangement
turned
out
to
be
excellent
i
loved
the
city
and
i
particularly
loved
the
gaiety
and
spirit
of
mardi
gras
i
had
seen
two
of
them
and
we
would
soon
be
in
another
city
wide
joyous
celebration
with
romance
in
the
air
and
when
you
took
a
walk
you
never
knew
what
adventure
or
pair
of
sparkling
eyes
were
waiting
around
the
next
corner
the
very
faces
of
the
people
bore
this
expectation
of
fun
and
pleasure
it
was
as
if
they
could
hardly
wait
to
get
into
their
costumes
cover
their
faces
with
masks
and
go
adventuring
my
uncle
and
i
were
not
too
close
socially
because
of
the
difference
in
our
ages
sometimes
i
wondered
vaguely
what
he
did
about
women
for
my
aunt
by
blood
had
died
some
years
ago
but
neither
of
us
said
anything
one
monday
morning
i
saw
him
approach
the
store
with
a
woman
and
introduce
me
to
her
as
my
new
aunt
they
were
married
over
the
week
end
though
he
was
easily
sixty
and
she
could
not
have
been
even
thirty
she
looked
more
like
twenty
five
or
six
it
was
really
a
may
and
december
combination
my
new
aunt
was
perhaps
three
or
four
years
older
than
i
and
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
i
had
seen
as
gorgeous
a
woman
who
oozed
sex
there
was
something
about
the
contour
of
her
face
her
smile
that
was
like
new
orleans
sunshine
the
way
she
held
her
head
the
way
she
walked
there
was
scarcely
anything
she
did
which
did
not
fascinate
me
her
legs
were
the
full
sexy
kind
full
bodied
like
a
rare
wine
and
just
as
tantalizing
to
the
appetite
the
calf
was
magnificent
the
ankle
perfect
you
must
forgive
me
if
i
seem
to
dwell
too
much
on
her
physical
aspects
but
i
am
an
artist
accustomed
to
studying
the
physical
body
the
true
artist
is
like
one
of
those
scientists
who
from
a
single
bone
can
reconstruct
an
animal
s
entire
body
the
artist
looks
at
an
ankle
a
calf
a
bosom
and
in
his
mind
s
eye
the
clothes
drop
away
and
he
sees
her
as
she
really
is
and
that
is
the
way
i
first
saw
her
when
my
uncle
brought
her
into
his
antique
store
that
she
impressed
me
instantly
was
obvious
i
was
aware
that
when
our
eyes
met
we
both
quickly
averted
them
i
thought
i
saw
a
faint
surge
of
color
rise
to
her
neck
and
quickly
suffuse
her
cheeks
true
she
was
my
aunt
married
to
an
uncle
related
to
me
only
by
marriage
but
why
she
had
married
a
man
twice
her
age
and
more
perhaps
i
did
not
know
or
much
care
she
was
standing
with
her
back
to
the
glass
door
her
form
was
silhouetted
and
with
the
strong
light
i
could
see
the
outlines
of
her
body
a
body
that
an
artist
or
anyone
else
would
have
admired
as
it
is
in
so
many
affairs
of
the
heart
a
man
and
a
woman
meet
and
something
clicks
something
clicked
in
this
instance
but
i
treated
her
circumspectly
and
i
felt
that
she
knew
it
for
we
both
kept
our
distance
when
she
appeared
at
the
store
to
help
out
for
a
few
hours
even
my
looking
at
her
was
surreptitious
lest
my
uncle
notice
it
and
then
i
became
aware
that
she
too
glanced
at
me
surreptitiously
i
felt
that
her
eyes
were
undressing
me
as
if
she
were
a
painter
and
i
a
nude
model
i
dismissed
these
feelings
as
wishful
thinking
but
i
could
not
get
it
out
of
my
head
that
we
had
a
strong
physical
attraction
for
one
another
and
we
both
feared
to
dwell
on
it
because
of
our
relationship
when
our
eyes
met
the
air
was
filled
with
an
unuttered
message
of
me
too
you
have
probably
experienced
this
it
is
nothing
you
can
put
your
fingers
on
but
the
air
suddenly
fills
with
a
high
charge
of
electricity
why
she
married
him
i
do
not
know
i
myself
was
fond
of
him
but
what
a
young
woman
half
his
age
saw
in
him
was
a
mystery
to
me
he
already
had
that
slow
pace
that
comes
over
the
elderly
while
she
herself
had
all
the
signs
of
one
who
appreciates
the
joys
of
living
perhaps
with
my
uncle
she
found
a
measure
of
economic
security
that
she
needed
or
maybe
she
liked
men
old
enough
to
be
her
father
some
women
with
father
fixations
do
for
several
weeks
we
eyed
one
another
almost
like
sparring
partners
and
then
one
day
uncle
was
slightly
indisposed
and
stayed
home
his
bride
opened
the
store
i
was
waiting
in
front
of
it
when
she
showed
up
and
told
me
of
my
uncle
s
indisposition
even
as
she
was
telling
me
about
it
i
became
aware
of
a
give
away
flush
that
suffused
her
neck
and
moved
upwards
to
her
cheeks
and
subconsciously
i
realized
that
when
she
entered
the
store
she
did
not
switch
on
the
lights
the
cavernous
depth
cluttered
with
antiques
echoed
to
her
hard
heels
as
she
walked
directly
to
the
office
in
the
rear
and
took
the
seat
at
his
desk
she
placed
her
palms
fingers
outspread
on
the
desk
in
an
odd
gesture
as
if
to
say
now
what
next
i
was
aware
of
a
humid
look
in
her
eyes
that
told
me
the
time
was
opportune
there
was
little
likelihood
of
any
customers
walking
in
at
that
hour
i
was
standing
beside
her
watching
the
outspread
palms
and
wondering
about
the
old
horsehair
sofa
against
the
wall
on
which
he
sometimes
napped
i
bent
and
kissed
the
still
pink
neck
and
suddenly
she
jumped
up
and
her
two
arms
encircled
me
in
a
bear
like
crush
her
mouth
which
had
been
so
much
in
my
thoughts
was
warm
and
moist
and
tender
i
heard
her
murmur
we
d
better
lock
the
door
it
did
not
take
me
long
to
slip
the
bolt
securely
and
return
to
the
rear
and
its
couch
when
we
opened
the
door
again
for
business
and
switched
on
the
lights
she
said
he
will
not
always
be
indisposed
i
know
i
was
thinking
about
that
how
will
we
work
it
out
i
do
n
t
know
she
said
you
re
the
man
you
figure
it
out
i
ve
noticed
the
way
you
ve
been
looking
at
me
ever
since
we
met
i
guess
we
both
felt
it
i
said
i
guess
so
she
said
but
now
what
even
as
i
said
it
i
realized
that
an
education
can
be
invaluable
i
know
what
we
can
do
i
said
tell
him
i
made
a
pass
at
you
she
raised
a
protesting
hand
with
a
startled
air
what
are
you
trying
to
do
get
thrown
out
if
i
even
hint
at
it
do
you
think
it
will
matter
that
you
are
his
nephew
and
not
even
a
blood
nephew
i
do
n
t
want
to
be
thrown
out
and
i
do
n
t
think
i
will
i
think
i
have
a
way
so
we
can
carry
on
without
his
suspecting
us
by
telling
him
you
are
making
passes
at
me
she
said
incredulously
when
i
was
in
college
i
grinned
i
remember
a
poem
i
had
to
read
in
my
lit
class
i
do
n
t
even
remember
who
wrote
it
but
it
was
one
of
those
th
or
th
century
poets
in
those
days
poems
often
told
a
story
in
verse
and
those
boys
had
some
corkers
to
tell
and
now
i
think
we
can
use
the
knowledge
they
passed
on
to
us
tomorrow
mardi
gras
opens
officially
a
lot
of
people
will
roam
the
streets
in
costumes
and
masks
and
having
a
ball
there
will
be
romance
and
flirtation
if
you
tell
him
i
made
a
pass
at
you
he
might
think
you
misunderstood
something
i
said
or
did
so
instead
of
just
telling
him
i
made
a
pass
say
i
tried
to
date
you
and
that
you
agreed
so
you
could
prove
to
him
what
a
louse
i
really
am
we
made
a
rendezvous
tomorrow
evening
at
nine
on
some
street
near
lake
ponchartrain
and
to
prove
what
you
tell
him
about
me
you
suggest
that
he
keep
the
date
instead
you
are
both
the
same
size
he
could
use
your
clothes
for
a
costume
and
a
heavy
veil
for
a
mask
when
i
show
up
he
will
know
you
are
a
good
wife
to
have
told
him
about
it
but
you
she
began
do
n
t
worry
about
me
it
will
turn
out
all
right
i
do
n
t
understand
she
insisted
are
you
trying
to
cut
your
throat
no
i
chuckled
i
m
just
beginning
to
collect
dividends
on
my
investment
in
education
as
we
expected
on
the
following
day
my
uncle
was
completely
recovered
and
opened
the
store
as
usual
at
in
the
morning
i
felt
that
he
looked
at
me
coldly
and
appraisingly
and
seemed
to
be
uncertain
what
his
attitude
towards
me
should
be
but
he
did
not
say
one
word
which
might
indicate
that
he
had
been
told
of
advances
to
his
wife
i
quit
work
at
my
usual
hour
as
if
this
day
was
no
different
from
other
days
i
heard
subsequently
that
my
uncle
and
aunt
had
dinner
in
a
nearby
restaurant
in
the
french
quarter
after
which
he
went
home
to
get
into
his
costume
to
keep
the
date
shortly
before
nine
i
drove
my
jalopy
to
the
street
facing
the
lake
and
parked
the
car
in
shadows
far
enough
away
from
the
rendezvous
corner
but
near
enough
to
keep
the
corner
in
clear
view
a
few
minutes
later
i
saw
my
uncle
s
car
drive
up
and
a
woman
s
figure
emerge
and
walk
to
the
corner
i
must
say
the
figure
was
well
made
up
if
it
were
not
that
i
knew
who
it
was
i
could
have
mistaken
it
for
my
aunt
so
well
did
her
clothes
fit
him
in
one
hand
he
gripped
firmly
a
parasol
though
there
had
been
no
indication
of
rain
i
suspected
why
he
brought
it
along
in
the
half
darkness
i
approached
cautiously
making
sure
he
did
not
see
me
he
was
looking
out
on
the
dark
waters
of
the
lake
when
i
came
upon
him
and
without
wasting
words
i
smacked
him
hard
across
the
face
you
cheap
bitch
i
exclaimed
you
cheap
no
good
two
timing
bitch
you
get
a
good
loyal
husband
smack
and
you
fall
for
a
pass
by
his
own
nephew
you
should
smack
be
ashamed
of
yourself
