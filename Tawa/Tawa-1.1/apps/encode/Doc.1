codelength
    Prints out the cost of encoding the input string (with respect to each model
    that is listed in the file whose filename is specified by the -m argument).
    See models.dat for an example.

codelength1
    Prints out the cost of encoding the input string specified by the -s
    argument with respect to the model specified by the -m argument.

    Prints out the list of probabilities for the entire alphabet at each stage
    of the encoding of the input file. Just one model is used.
