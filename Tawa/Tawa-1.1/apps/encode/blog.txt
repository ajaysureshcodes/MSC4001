the trip was fantastic, plimoth was old and there were real live pilgrims everywhere, salem was cute and adorable but very touristy, ithaca was gorgeous and adorable and joel was there so the whole thing made me very happy and clearly that was the highlight of the trip, niagara was fantastically beautiful but boring once you’ve seen the falls, buffalo was sketchy but had great wings and now im home, and i think it’s the most wonderful place ive ever been and i dont ever want to leave!
