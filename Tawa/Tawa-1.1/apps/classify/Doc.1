This directory contains source for the executables "ident_lang" and "ident_file":

difference
    compares how well two models do on the same input file.
    prints out varying length contexts and the two models' codelength
    differences which can then be sorted later.

ident_lang
    identifies the language of the input string (with respect to each model
    that is listed in the file whose filename is specified by the -m argument).
    See ident_models.dat for an example.

ident_file
    identifies the language of the input file (with respect to each model
    that is listed in the file whose filename is specified by the -m argument).
    See ident_models.dat for an example.

ident_file1
    identifies the language of the input file (with respect to each model
    that is listed in the file whose filename is specified by the -m argument).
    See ident_models.dat for an example. Prints out results in
    (codelength, filename, model-tagname) format, one per line.

ident_file2
    Analyzes a succession of files to find when there is the greatest
    jump in entropy by computing the sum of the compressed lengths
    of the current file using the previous file's model plus the
    prevous file using the current file's model

ident_file3
    Same as ident_file, but only performs calculations on a single test file
    (this is needed when using dynamic models as the model adapts to the
    text being tested so subsequent loadings of a different file will depend
    on which file was tested previously (not desirable)

radius_file
    Computes the information radius for a succession of files
    based on the average distribution of two models, the positive
    and negative models for each topic

radius_file1
    Computes the information radius for a succession of files
    based on the average distribution between the collection
    model and all the topic models

leave_one_out
    Classifies a set of files using a set of models plus a model
    built from the set of files with the test file being "left out"

leave_one_out1
    Classifies a set of files using a set of models plus a model
    built from the set of files with the test file being "left out"
    - Uses codelength difference rather than just codelength as
    for leave_one_out
