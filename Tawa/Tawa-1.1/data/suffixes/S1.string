South Kivu Deputy Governor Lwasi Ngabo Lwabanji who gave some 200,000 Tutsis or Banyamulenges a week to leave, expiring on Tuesday, said he was told by telephone he had been suspended.
"I know of no operation against the Banyamulenge people as a whole, but certainly the Zairean army will continue operations against those of them who have taken up arms," government spokesman Boguo Makeli said.
