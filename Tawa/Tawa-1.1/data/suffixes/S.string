South Kivu Deputy Governor Lwasi Ngabo Lwabanji who gave some 200,000 Tutsis or Banyamulenges a week to leave, expiring on Tuesday, said he was told by telephone he had been suspended.
"I know of no operation against the Banyamulenge people as a whole, but certainly the Zairean army will continue operations against those of them who have taken up arms," government spokesman Boguo Makeli said.
It is not clear if the government has control of military operations against Banyamulenge, who settled in the region about 200 years ago from Rwanda.
The official, who asked not to be identified, said the Banyamulenge had made a grave mistake by taking up arms against the Zairean army, fuelling tension in an already tense region.
"Traditionally the Banyamulenge Tutsis are dynamic and wealthy so there is a tendency among other groups to recent them," he said. "By taking up arms the Banyamulenge are paving the way for other communities to chase them away."
The official added that indigenous Zaireans had volunteered to help the army in battling Banyamulenge rebels.
Clashes between Banyamulenges and indigenous peoples have degenerated into virtual civil war since more than a million rival Rwanda Hutus fled violence into the same region in 1994.
