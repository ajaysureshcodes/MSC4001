    Scientists are concerned about reports that the US has denied 
entry to R. Chidambaram and possibly other Indian scientists 
attending open scientific conferences, and to scientists
and physics students accepted into US graduate schools.  Tensions 
are high over India's nuclear program, but Cold War scientific 
exchange between the US and the USSR "is generally credited
with being a major factor in keeping the war cold."

    California is considering a bill -- SB 2189 by Sen. John 
Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara) -- that would let state-regulated 
venture funds bring in more small investors, thus encouraging 
venture deals too small or risky to interest large pension fund 
managers.  (A 1996 Federal law opened up the possibility of funds 
with more than 100 investors, for investments chiefly within
one state.)  The bill would likely open up VC funding in the range 
of $250K-$5M.  Lawmakers are still debating how to enforce
quality management and protect investors.  [Sacramento Bee.
