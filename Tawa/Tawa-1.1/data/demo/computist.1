    AFOSR and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at WPAFB 
are seeking proposals by 09Sep98 on Hybrid Evolutionary Learning 
for Pattern Recognition.  (PRDA 98-04-SNK; Alan Struckman,

    The Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is planning a FY99-00
broad agency announcement for experimental, developmental,
and research work in  1) information science/technology -- 
including fuzzy logic, DB, SE, distributed hypermedia, knowledge 
interchange, simulation, and probably anything else useful to
the Army -- and in  2) sensors, electron devices, and signal 
processing;  3) warfare and e-warfare survivability analyses;
4) weapons and materials research; and  5) corporate information 
and computing, including HPCC.  SOL DAAL01-99-ARLBAA; Shirley 
Harvey <sharvey@arl.mil>, (301) 394-2889.  The 2-year BAA
will be issued in late Sep98, online only, for response
at any time but preferably by 15Dec98 for FY99 funding.

.solicitations, 09Jul98.]  (Pre-announcements such as this
give researchers a chance to add their own fields to
the solicited topics, and give minority schools
and small businesses a chance to influence their set-asides.)

    DARPA/ETO and the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center,
San Diego (SPAWARSYSCEN) are seeking R&D proposals through 30Jun99 
for microelectronics, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), 
opto-electronics and/or photonics technology.  "The current focus 
of ETO is with research of engineered microsystems to perceive
and control the physical world."  <http://www.darpa.mil>.
SOL N66001-98-X-6904; Maureen Battern <battern@spawar.navy.mil>, 
(619) 553-4489, or Dr. Cynthia Hanson <chanson@spawar.navy.mil> 
for scientific questions.  [CBD, gov.us.fed.doc.cbd.solicitations,

    The USMC Maritime Prepositioning Program/MARCORSYSCOM
is soliciting Windows 95/98/NT software for automated
container load planning (or bin packing, in research terms).

    NSF/CISE's Connections to the Internet program has
annual deadlines of 31Jul and 31Jan.  It can cover
"connections for research and education institutions and 
facilities that have meritorious applications with special
network requirements (such as high bandwidth and/or bounded 
latency) that cannot readily be met through commodity network 
service providers," in addition to connections for schools, 
libraries, and museums.  <http://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin

(NSF also funds supercomputer time, and can help arrange 
collaborations with schools that have high-speed connections
or unique resources.  Collaborations are a great way to get
into mainstream research.)

    NSF and Brazil have a new pilot program for cooperative
CS research.  See <http://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?nsf98139>
for NSF-CNPq Collaborative Research Opportunities for FY 1998,
due the first Friday in October each year.  [<nsf-braz@nsf.gov>.
