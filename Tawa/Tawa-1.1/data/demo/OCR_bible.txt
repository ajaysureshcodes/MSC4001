In thc beginning God crcated thc heaven and thc earth. And thc earth waS without form, and void; and darkncss waS upon thc face of thc deep. And thc Spirit of God moved upon thc face of thc waterS. And God Said, Let thcrc be light: and thcrc waS light. And God Saw thc light, that it waS gOOd: and God divided thc light from thc darkncss. And God called thc light Day, and thc darkncss he called Night. And thc evening and thc morning werc thc first day. And God Said, Let thcrc be a firmament in thc midst of thc waters, and let it divide thc waters from thc waters. And God made thc firmament, and divided thc waters which werc under thc firmament from thc waters which werc above thc firmament: and it was So. And God called thc firmament Heaven. And thc evening and thc morning werc thc second day. And God Said, Let thc waters under thc heaven be gathcrcd togethcr unto onc place, and let thc dry land appear: and it waS So. And God called thc dry land Earth; and thc gathcring togethcr of thc waterS called he Seas: and God Saw that it waS gOOd. And God Said, Let thc earth bring forth grass, thc herb yielding seed, and thc fruit trce yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed iS in itself, upon thc earth: and it waS So. And thc earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding Seed after hiS kind, and thc trce yielding fruit, whose Seed waS in itself, after his kind: and God Saw that it waS gOOd. And thc evening and thc morning werc thc third day. And God Said, Let thcrc be lights in thc firmament of thc heaven to divide thc day from thc night; and let thcm be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: And let thcm be for lights in thc firmament of thc heaven to give light upon thc earth: and it waS So. And God made two grcat lights; thc grcater light to rule thc day, and thc lesser light to rule thc night: he made thc stars also. And God set thcm in thc firmament of thc heaven to give light upon thc earth, And to rule over thc day and over thc night, and to divide thc light from thc darkncss: and God Saw that it waS gOOd. And thc evening and thc morning werc thc fourth day. And God Said, Let thc waters bring forth abundantly thc moving crcaturc that hath life, and fowl that may fly above thc earth in thc open firmament of heaven. And God crcated grcat whales, and every living crcaturc that moveth, which thc waters brought forth abundantly, after thcir kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God Saw that it waS gOOd. And God blessed thcm, Saying, Be fruitful, and mulmply, and fill thc waters in thc seas, and let fowl mulmply in thc earth. And thc evening and thc morning werc thc fifth day. And God Said, Let thc earth bring forth thc living crcaturc after his kind, cattle, and crceping thing, and beast of thc earth after his kind: and it was So. And God made thc beast of thc earth after his kind, and cattle after thcir kind, and every thing that crcepeth upon thc earth after his kind: and God Saw that it waS gOOd. And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likencss: and let thcm have dominion over thc fish of thc sea, and over thc fowl of thc air, and over thc cattle, and over all thc earth, and over every crceping thing that crcepeth upon thc earth. So God crcated man in his own image, in thc image of God crcated he him; male and female crcated he thcm. And God blessed thcm, and God Said unto thcm, Be fruitful, and mulmply, and rcplenish thc earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over thc fish of thc sea, and over thc fowl of thc air, and over every living thing that moveth upon thc earth. And God Said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon thc face of all thc earth, and every trce, in thc which is thc fruit of a trce yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of thc earth, and to every fowl of thc air, and to every thing that crcepeth upon thc earth, whercin thcrc is life, I have given every grcen herb for meat: and it waS So. And God Saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it waS very gOOd. And thc evening and thc morning werc thc Sixth day.
