Greetings, Computists!

    I'm back to my editing work, and will fill out this week
with the newsletter issues that I skipped last week.

    Brandon's mishap with a car turning across his path
was fortunately limited to abrasions on his right knee
and forearm plus some glass shards, one slight tendon nick,
and some air/bacteria contact with his joint tissues.  No spinal 
or neural problems detected so far.  The hospital cleaned him up, 
administered IV antibiotics, and started him on physical therapy.  
He's home now, watching videos and finding excuses not to stretch 
the skin where they stitched it over the wounds.  He can sit in
a wheelchair -- with his right leg braced and extended --
and can hobble a bit on one crutch.  Thanks for your concern;
Brandon is more aware of his support network now, and more 
appreciative.  A significant growing-up experience.

    One of the hardest parts of this week was dealing with
the UC Berkeley class reservation system on Brandon's behalf.
The touchtone interface must be hell, as even the Web version
is hard to use.  We only had a two-day window, half the classes he 
wanted were full (including Intro to Programming), the system 
terminates each session after 10 minutes, and we were only allowed 
25 sessions -- which we discovered after using about 20 of them.  
Brandon's calculus course had shifted from an afternoon slot
to a morning one -- not shown in the printed catalog, or in
the teleBears sign-up system -- and we had to keep switching 
between teleBears and the infoBears online course catalog
to see how many people were waiting for each lecture, lab,
and discussion session.  It seems to me that UCB could offer
an operations research or AI-based scheduling system to help 
students find conflict-free schedules (with favored teachers
and classrooms, no classes before 9am, and other desiderata),
or with conflicts limited to classes that are most likely
to open additional sections.  Maybe a Computist could win
funding to develop such a system, as a testbed for
soft constraint-based reasoning under dynamic conditions.
