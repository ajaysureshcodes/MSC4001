Jefferson the Virginian
by Dumas Malone

I
Jeffersons and Randolphs
1679-1745

Thomas Jefferson was born in a simple wooden house in
what is now Albermarle County, Virginia. At that time the district
was in the County of Goochland, and Virginia was a province of King
George II of Great Britain. By the calendar then in effect the birthday
was April 2, 1743, but according to the New Style, which was adopted
when Jefferson was still a boy, it was April 13, and thus it has been
celebrated through the years. This was a delicious season, for the air of
the Virginia Piedmont is soft in April, the dogwood soon opens in the
woods, and the wild honeysuckle begins to bloom. The house has long
since vanished, but the site is marked and anybody who goes there now
can see that it was well chosen. To the southward it overlooks the
Rivanna River, often referred to then as the North River or North
Branch of the James. This is now a muddy and unimpressive stream
but it once was purer. The prospect to the west is finer, for on any
clear day the distant Blue Ridge can be seen through a gap in the
Southwest Mountains.

The place was called Shadwell. Peter Jefferson, who owned it, had
named if for the parish in London where his wife, Jane Randolph, had
been christened twenty-three years before. The setting did not suggest
the Thames Basin or Hanoverian England, however. This was not a
rainy but generally a sunny land, and it had no antiquity or mellowness,
for as a seat of settlement it was almost wholly new. The hardwood
forests which covered the bottom lands and steep hillsides were
broken by only a few clearings where the red soil glowed, and the first
wails of this newborn infant could have been echoed by the howling
of the wolves. The earliest surroundings of this natural philosopher
were beautiful but they were wild. Jefferson was born on the fringe
of western settlement, and some will say that he thus became a child
of the American frontier.

No influence upon him was more abiding than that of Nature,
and throughout life he deeply loved this region of wooded hills and
lavender-tinted mountains. But Shadwell was not the home of his
earliest memories. When he was two or three years old he was taken
from it to Tuckahoe on the James, to an older and better house in a
more thickly settled district. At that time no parts of Virginia
were thickly settled; with a few exceptions the entire Province was a vast
forest. Tobacco plantations and their seats were strung loosely along
the rivers, but to all European observers the clearings seemed small
and the country looked uninhabited. The vastness of this physical
setting was not lost upon Thomas Jefferson; it was reflected in the
largeness of the mind. Furthermore, this society as a whole was closer
to the frontier than later generations might at first realize. But Jefferson
was in Albemarle only intermittently during his boyhood, and he
knew the region best after the fringe of settlement stretched well
beyond it. He as used to sparsely settled country, but he did not know
the frontier by experience; and though he was always aware of the
wilderness, he was not in the physical sense an explorer.


Peter Jefferson, a man of huge stature and legendary strength, was
in his mid-thirties in 1743. He performed memorable deeds as a surveyor
in uncharted country in later years, but at no time was he a typical
frontiersman. He was not yet at the height of his fortunes, though
he was a slaveowner and he had other lands below the James thirty
miles or so to the southeast, where he had previously lived. He was no
landless pioneer but an enterprising young planter who may have
ventured a bit too far to the westward in this instance. He had been
there several years, however; he had intended to stay; and he may
already have planned the extensive group of plantation buildings he
eventually erected. He built only a modest unit at first, and it was to
this plain house that he had brought his wife and two little daughters
the year before his third child and first son was born. Jane Randolph
may not have liked the extreme remoteness of Shadwell, and probably
was glad that her first stay there was short.

The most important early fact about Thomas Jefferson is not that
he appeared on the edge of settlement but that he was born in the
Province of Virginia and that, from his first days, he was numbered
among its gentry. He was not born to physical hardship as Abraham
Lincoln was; he did not know town life from boyhood as Benjamin
Franklin did; in the ordinary meaning of the term he was no self-made
man. He grew up in the generous society which had been created in a
new country and a warm climate by a group of planters, cultivating
tobacco and relying on slave labor. From his earliest memories his
financial position was assured, and the best educational opportunities
which the Colony afforded were later available to him. He gave chief
thanks to his father for all this, and he himself would have made Peter
Jefferson the dominant character in his early history. But this plantation
society centered in families, and Thomas Jefferson's history necessarily
begins as a story of a family -- or rather of two families, and
how they merged.


Jefferson's connections stood him in good stead while he was growing
up and he always valued them on personal grounds, but he never
spent much of his previous time on the remote subject of genealogy.
As a young man he was not wholly indifferent to his ancestry, but in
the ripeness of age he made light of it and there are a number of people
now living who know more about it than he did. To him the degree
of their interest would seem surprising, for he was more interested in
the origins of laws and institutions than in the beginnings of any
particular family, and he belonged to the school of thought which
magnified the influence of environment and minimized heredity -- too much,
probably. The progenitor in whom he took greatest pride was his
father, and this because of what Peter Jefferson did rather than what
he inherited.

His father was a man of deeds, not words, but there is indication that
this inarticulate squire set considerable store by family traditions. The
Naming of Shadwell showed that, although Jane Randolph may have
made the original suggestion. Furthermore, he afterwards had a place
on the Fluvanna River which he called Snowdon after a mountain in
Wales near which the Jeffersons were supposed once to have lived.
Whether they ever did seems to be beyond the possibility of historical
verification and the matter is of no real importance. If they were
originally Welsh, they had become predominantly English after they had
lived for several generations in Virginia.

Thomas Jefferson's own knowledge of his paternal ancestry went
back only to his grandfather, after whom he was named. The line can
be traced with certainty only one step further -- to an obscure man
whom we shall call Thomas Jefferson I for the purposes of this story.
He was a farmer, naturally enough, and by the year 1679 he was living
in Henrico County (which was then much larger than it now is),
considerably below the present location of Richmond. He was in the
Curls region -- so called because of the eccentricities of the James River,
which in one stretch of six miles managed to meaner through sixteen.
This was in the low and level Tidewater country, overspread with
heavy forests and flowering shrubs, where practically all of the
Virginians then were.

As far to the west as settlers dared go lived an exceedingly
enterprising man named William Byrd. From the falls of the James he
dispatched traders into the Carolinas to barter with the Indians. In
1682 Thomas Jefferson I, who himself had moved further westward,
had a small business transaction with this magnate. He bought from
him a "parcel" of land, consisting of about one hundred and sixty-seven
acres. Technically he was then a squatter on this very piece of
property, though the presumption is that nobody thought his conduct at
all reprehensible. The Governor, finding that the land had escheated
to the King, had granted it to another -- who had assigned it to the
acquisitive Byrd, and the latter at length sold it to the occupant for
a "valuable consideration". The real moral of the tale is that neither
in financial power nor worldly wisdom were the early Jeffersons a
match for the early Byrds. On the other hand, this ancestor of a
President must have had some capital, and apparently he was not the sort of
farmer who could be easily evicted by a richer man. Presumably this
was the place where his son lived afterwards; if so, it was on the south
bank of the river some twenty miles below the falls and strategically
situated for a landing.

At this time there were land barons in Virginia to whom such
holdings seemed small and such a man inconsequential, but the heyday of
the plantation aristocracy had not yet arrived. Though the economic
and social structure of the Colony was taking form it had not attained
rigidity. Life was dispersed and fluid in this spacious country, and
here, for many years yet, vigorous and ambitious men had an excellent
chance to rise. This was an unequal society in an age of recognized
inequality but, except for the lowest group, the slaves, it was not one
of rigid caste. The road to riches and power lay open to those who
acquired land while it was still easy to get, and who somehow found
labor with which to exploit it. The distinct advantage lay with those
who had influence and capital. Labor was always scarcer than land, and
slaves rather than acreage came to be the major criterion of prosperity.
But no one had many slaves or much ready money in the late seventeenth
century, and the status of a small landowner who tilled a virgin
soil was far from degraded. His life was undoubtedly crude, but nature
was prodigal and the future beckoned.

The first Thomas Jefferson probably had little capital or influence
but he went forward  on the road to fortune and a genteel station.
Besides bearing and transmitting a good name, he increased his holdings
and became a man of respectable estate. He acquired no military
title but, judging from the number of wolf bounties he collected, he
had some prowess as a hunter. He became one of "ye surveyours of ye
highways," thus establishing a tradition in the family; he frequently
did jury duty, and as a man of recognized integrity he served several
times as an executor of wills. His wife, Mary Branch, brought him some
property, and when he dies in 1697 he had several slaves. Besides his
widow, Mary, he left a son Thomas and a daughter Martha. These
three names kept reappearing in the family with unfailing regularity;
they were all present at Monticello.

It would be easy to make too much of the fact that Mary Branch
Jefferson, three years after she became a widow, married a man who
could sign the wedding contract only by making his mark, for her
second husband, Joseph Mattocks, had property and she herself could
write her name. There is no reason to suppose, however, that either
she or her first husband was a cultivated person. Probably there was no
time in the history of this Province when it was more difficult to
become one. Before the establishment of the College of William and
Mary, practically the only educational opportunities were those that
England provided a few of the very rich. The result was a generation
of men who, if they had the good fortune to read and write, "had no
further commerce with the Muses, or learned sciences; but spent their
life ignobly at the hoe and spade, and other employments of an
uncultivated and unpolished country." Not until the greatest of the name
appeared did any of the Jeffersons have much learning, but the lack of
it was too general at this time to constitute an insuperable bar to
admission into the lesser gentry.


Whether or not the first Thomas Jefferson should be called a yeoman
is a question of definition and a matter of no real consequence. The
second of the name as officially a gentleman. Before the end of the
century Thomas II owned a racing mare, and racing was generally a
prerogative of the gentry. More significant than this is the fact that
he became one of the "gentleman justices" of Henrico County before
he was thirty, and that he continued to be one for almost twenty
years. Among his "honorable" associates were the second William
Randolph and an early Francis Eppes. These highly reputable names
reappear in the story of his descendants. Besides being a local
magistrate he was a captain of the militia. The officers generally dined
together after muster, and upon one of these occasions Colonel William
Byrd, second of the name and the elegant master of Westover, ate
roast beef at Jefferson's house. For at least two years the Captain held
the important post of sheriff at Henrico, as a justice might have been
expected to do, and he was once recompensed for extraordinary services.
He is said to have built a church in Bristol Parish which was called
"Jefferson's Church" for half a century. There is no clue to his
personality but he must have been vigorous; and there can be no question
of his official standing or sense of public responsibility. In this society
the two were inseparable.

Soon after his father's death and shortly before he attained his
majority, he married Mary Field, daughter of Major Peter Field of
New Kent County and his wife Judith, who was the widow of Henry
Randolph and the daughter of a former speaker of the House of
Burgesses. From both the financial and social point of view this was
an advantageous alliance. He received grants of land on several occasions
for the importation of persons into the Colony; and he engaged
in numerous land transactions after the manner of the enterprising
planters of his day, though not on the vast scale of the Byrds, the
Randolphs, and the Carters. The grant of fifteen hundred acres on Fine
Creek, south of the James, and well above the falls, which was made
to him and three others by Governor Spotswood in 1718, anticipated
the westward movement in which his son took part. He himself had
his house at what was repeatedly referred to as Jefferson's Landing,
later described as Osborne's.

Here, on the last day of February, 1707/1708, his son Peter was born.
There were three children already -- Judith, Thomas, and Field -- and
later there were two more daughters, bearing the inevitable names Mary
and Martha. When Peter was eight he lost his mother, and his father
appears to have remarried later, though the Captain was again a widower
when he died. Long years afterward, writing his autobiography
at Monticello, Thomas Jefferson said that his father's mind was
naturally strong but that his education had been neglected. In comparison
with Thomas's superior opportunities, Peter's was unquestionably
limited, as were those of so many others in that dispersed society.
He did not grow up in such ignorance as to be seriously handicapped
in practical affairs, but the accident of his position within the
family may have caused him to be relatively neglected. He lost his
mother while he was still a child, and as the youngest of three sons
he had only modest expectations in his youth. Attention was probably
centered in the heir apparent, the third Thomas, who was born in
1700 and dies twenty-three years later on a ship commanded by
Captain Isham Randolph. Peter Jefferson himself afterwards married
this Captain Randolph's daughter.

Though there can be no question of the honorable standing of Peter's
father, the second Thomas Jefferson, there is considerable doubt about
the degree of his prosperity in the last decade of his life. He suffered
a heavy loss from fire which occasioned him to petition the House of
Burgesses for relief; and a few years later, when he failed to context
a suit against him for #6,480 of tobacco, the court ordered an
attachment of his property sufficient to satisfy his debt. The will
which he drew six years before his death in 1731, and the inventory
which ultimately went with it, show that he had considerably more
household goods, livestock, and servants than Thomas Jefferson I had
had, but they leave many unanswered questions about his land.

Neither Peter nor his elder brother Field lived on the ancestral acres
after their father died. As a justice of the peace in Lunenburg, Field
maintained the connection of the family with the county gentry.
Peter, who was named his father's executor, got the holdings on Fine
and "Manikin" Creeks in Goochland County, and if he did not already
live on them he soon began to. His inheritance of land was probably
fair-sized, though certainly not princely. Besides this he received the
bulk of his father's personal possessions, including half of the livestock,
a couple of horses, and two slaves, presumably body servants. To a
modest extent he was a slaveowner, and by birth and association he
was a member of the country gentry. He cannot be described as a completely
self-made man, but the enhancement of his fortunes, like the
improvement of his mind, must be chiefly attributed to his own
exertions.

Soon after he presented his father's will and had it approved in the
county court he removed, or returned to Fine Creek. He was then
about twenty-five years old and at the peak of his great physical
strength. The County of Goochland, to which he went, had recently
been set off from Henrico; it lay above the fall line and straddled the
James. Peter's place was on a minor tributary to the south of the river.
Here he lived some ten years, until about 1741, developing his plantation,
acquiring claims and titles elsewhere, and gaining for himself a
recognized standing in the district. The date of his definite establishment
as a local leader was 1734, when he followed in his father's footsteps
by becoming a justice of the peace; three years later, when he was
thirty, he became sheriff; later still, after he had wandered far and
gained laurels elsewhere, he was county surveyor.

When Peter first came to Goochland, the strategic post of surveyor
was held by one of his near neighbors, William Mayo, probably the
foremost Virginia surveyor of his time. Mayo helped run the
dividing line between Virginia and North Carolina, immortalized by
the second William Byrd. Peter Jefferson, who afterwards helped
extend this dividing line, appears to have accompanied his neighbor on
some of his later trips and from him he probably acquired the elements
of surveying. Such knowledge was immensely useful to any planter
and it played an important part in Peter's successful career, as it did
in that of George Washington. He engaged in surveying throughout
the rest of his life and by means of it won for himself an honorable if
minor place in the history of American exploration.


On the other side of the James from Fine Creek, and fifteen miles
or more to the eastward, was Tuckahoe. The house had been built by
Thomas Randolph, now dead, who had been the foremost citizen of
the new County. He as one of the seven sons of William Randolph of
Turkey Island and is generally known as "Thomas of Tuckahoe." The
custom of designating individuals by their plantation seals arose
naturally in a society which made a practice of repeating Christian names
from generation to generation, and it has proved a boon to confused
antiquarians ever since. It became a virtual necessity among the
innumerable Randolphs. No inappropriately have William of Turkey Island
and his wife Mary Isham been termed "the Adam and Eve of Virginia."
Bearers of the Randolph name sprouted like so many pine
trees in an abandoned field and many of them became monarchs of the
forest. If descendants through maternal lines are counted, the long roll
of this remarkable clan falls little short of comprising the entire body
of the gentry. It includes the names of Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall,
and Robert E. Lee, and if viewed comprehensively it defies comparison
with any other American family.

Peter Jefferson's first close contact with the Randolphs came through
the young master of Tuckahoe, the son of Thomas, who was names
William like his grandfather and one of his uncles, thus adding to the
genealogical confusion. According to the second William Byrd, this
William Randolph was "a pretty young man" who had the misfortune
to become his own master too soon. Perhaps he was not sufficiently
deferential to the Colonel. That urbane gentleman remarked that he
had a strange conceit of his won sufficiency which was accentuated
by a small smattering of learning. William of Tuckahoe was five or
six years younger than Peter Jefferson, who by all accounts was modest.
The friendship of these county neighbors may have been a case of the
attraction of opposites, or merely the result of propinquity in a fluid
and friendly society. The two young men became magistrates in the
same year, and their names were linked from that time forward. They
were intimate for more than a decade, and almost a half-century later
their lines were joined by the marriage of their grandchildren. There
was instability in this branch of the Randolphs and, beginning with
Peter, the Jeffersons served to offset it.

On the same side of the river as Tuckahoe and somewhat west of
Fine Creek was a place called Dungeness, belonging to Isham Randolph,
uncle of young William. The eldest of the many children there was
a girl named Jane. She was nineteen and Peter Jefferson was thirty-two
when he married her in October, 1739. Perhaps the courtship began
a couple of years earlier, for her father and William of Tuckahoe had
shared Peter's bond for one thousand pounds sterling when he became
sheriff. Isham probably knew and trusted him even before that, but
he himself had not yet settled down at Dungeness when Peter first
came to Goochland. Isham's daughter had been born in England, and
he was no man of the back country. He had had greater opportunities
and a more colorful life than Peter's father.


Isham Randolph and five of his brothers attended the College of
William and Mary. His grandson observed afterwards that in this
family they never hesitated to employ their considerable means for
the purposes of education. It is not necessary to add that their social
connections were of the best. While Isham was in his twenties, yet
unmarried and still living at Turkey Island, he frequently visited Westover
and was on intimate terms with Captain Jefferson's superior officer
in the militia, the second and most famous William Byrd, who was
twelve years older than young Randolph. For some weeks in the winter
of 1710, after the colonel had indiscreetly offered to teach him French,
Isham was almost continuously at Westover and had lessons from his
host, making some progress. But his chief yearning was for the sea, and
Byrd helped him satisfy it by recommending him for the command of
a ship. By the fall of that year he was referring to Isham as "Captain"
and putting tobacco aboard his vessel. Intimate social relations between
the two men were maintained during Byrd's later residence in London.

It was probably in 1718 that Captain Randolph found a wife in England.
His marriage to Jane, daughter of Charles and Jane Lilburne
Rogers, took place in the "parish of White Chapel," London. She appears
to have been living with her widowed mother, a distant relative of
"Freeborn John" Lilburne. For his times and circumstances Isham had
married late, but his wife proved to be as prolific as the other Randolph
matrons; they had nine children who survived infancy. The first of
these, Jane, was baptized at St. Paul's, Shadwell, on February 20, 1720,
when her future husband was about thirteen. Her father was referred
to as "Isham Randolph, in Shakespeare's Walk, merchant"; but he was
known as "Captain" for almost twenty years longer, and not until the
last decade of his life did he wholly abandon the sea. Thus there was
a nautical strain in the ancestry of President Jefferson which the critics
of his commercial policy quite overlooked; he himself employed nautical
terms in figures of speech though he was not a good sailor.

Captain Randolph probably made lengthy sojourns in England after
his marriage, and upon at least one important occasion he acted there
as agent for his native Province. Sometime before the spring of 1736,
he made his last voyage. William Byrd, then back in Virginia, wrote
to an agent in England: "Sir John Randolph is dead, and unless his
brother Isham return to his own element the sea, I fear he won't survive
him many years." Captain Randolph and his family were established
at Dungeness before this time and had become acquainted with
Peter Jefferson.

By inheritance and grant Isham had become a large landholder in
Goochland. In the year that Peter Jefferson became a magistrate
Randolph got a patent for three thousand acres, and in connection with it
he certified to the importation of forty-nine persons into the Colony.
Two years later he entered into agreements whereby two bond servants,
in return for the time of servitude due him, should make for him
respectively one hundred thousand bricks and two hundred and fifty
pairs of shoes. He was carrying on extensive building operations and
supporting a large establishment. In the year of his daughter's marriage
he shared a consignment of three hundred and eighty Negroes. His
son-in-law had preceded him as a pioneer but had not been in a position
to conduct affairs on such a scale.

His circle of friends was wider than that of the Jeffersons. To
Dungeness in 1738 came John Bartram the Pennsylvania botanist, at
the suggestion of Peter Collinson, who had became acquainted with
Isham in London. The correspondent of Benjamin Franklin had recommended
to Friend Bartram that on one leg of his projected journey to
Virginia he stop to see Colonel Byrd at Westover and Colonel John
Custis, Junior, at Williamsburg, "both curious men," and that he then
proceed to Isham's place, where he would receive a warm welcome.
Of Bartram's comments on his visit to Dungeness, and on the botanical
excursions which he centered there, the following would probably
have been the greatest interest to Jane Randolph's plant-loving son.
"There grows on the other side of the James River," said Bartram to
Colonel Custis, "a little above Isham Randolph's, a tree, the kind of
which is known in Europe by the name of Thuyja, or Arbor Vitae,
which if thee could procure some seed thereof, if it growed, would be
a curious ornament in thy garden. I doubt not, if thee was to write
or speak to Isham, he would procure thee some." His description of
his host to Collinson as "a generous, good-natured gentleman, and
well-respected by most who are acquainted with him," may sound like faint
praise, but at least it reveals that Isham had the characteristic social
virtues of his class. This friendly man afterwards regretted that he
could not entertain his former guest by sending him the account of
some new discovery, and confessed "the want of a penetrating genius
in the curious beauties of nature." Perhaps he was unduly modest, but
unquestionably his scientific curiosity fell short of that of his grandson.

Public service was expected of one with Isham Randolph's family
connections and landed possessions, and he would probably have been
drafted sooner had he settled earlier upon the land. About a year before
his daughter's marriage he was elected a burgess for Goochland County,
but his entire legislative career actually extended to only a few weeks.
His military service was more conspicuous. In the same month that he
was chosen a burgess he was appointed adjutant general of the Colony,
and he held this office until his death four years later. He was expected
to go into various counties and give instruction in the "form of
exercise" that had been prepared for the soldiers. The Council which
appointed him described him as a well-known gentleman and universally
acceptable in the country. Greater military responsibilities soon
fell to his lot. In the year 1740, a contingent of Virginia troops was
raised to serve with the British on the expedition against the Spanish at
Carthagena. Governor Gooch took charge of these and left the Colony
for a year. During his absence Isham Randolph acted as chief officer
of the local militia, and for this reason it has sometimes been said that
he was designated as lieutenant general of the Colony. There were
plenty of military titles in Thomas Jefferson's ancestral record. His
maternal grandfather may not have been a conspicuously martial figure,
but at least Isham was a link in a highly honorable military tradition.
His successor as adjutant general was Lawrence Washington, and when
the latter died three years later, the Colony was divided into districts
and four adjutants were appointed. Among these was Lawrence's
brother George.

It is difficult to recover the personality of a man from his portrait or
his epitaph. It may be reported, however, that Isham Randolph appeared
in a picture frame as a gentleman in conventional costume,
wearing a wig, and with ruffles at his writs. His full face implied good
living, but it was also long, and some people might see in it a
resemblance to Thomas Jefferson, even though the latter's nose was rather
more uplifted. The epitaph on his tombstone at Turkey Island says that
he possessed the distinguishing qualities of a gentleman to an eminent
degree, and gives further testimony to his good nature. "By an easy
compliance and obliging deportment he knew no enemy, but gained
many friends, thus in his life meriting an universal esteem." He died
at the age of fifty-seven, in November, 1742 -- three years after the
marriage of his daughter to Peter Jefferson, and only a few months
before the birth of their first son.


Peter was older than the average when he married, just as his
father-in-law had been. His wife had been promised a dowry of two hundred
pounds sterling, but Isham had not paid it by the time he made his will.
Jane Randolph probably took a body servant or so with her but she
seems to have brought her husband no land. That was generally left to
sons if there were any. The rising young planter acquired no fortune
by his marriage, but he gained for his unborn children a far more
extensive and influential family connection than he himself had enjoyed.
It is likely that the couple began their married life comfortably but
modestly at Fine Creek and that their first two children were born
there.

Four or five years before his marriage Peter had staked out a claim
on the Rivanna below the gap in the Southwest Mountains. The date
of his earliest known grant in this remote region was June 14, 1734,
when his future wife was only fourteen. He may have made his surveys
before the leaves fell, and he certainly received a patent for one
thousand acres before the passing of another summer. His tract extended
southward from Secretary's Ford just above the mountains and included
the late site of Monticello and a body of bottom land below
the little river. Within a year he began to look for a more suitable
homesite than his own lands afforded. His friend William Randolph of
Tuckahoe, who had probably interested him in this region in the first
place, had acquired lands north of the Rivanna which were still
undeveloped. Peter made a deal whereby he acquired two hundred acres
of these in return for a bowl of arrack punch concocted by Henry
Wetherburn of the Raleigh Tavern in Williamsburg. Not until two
years after his marriage, however, did Peter round out the home tract.
He then acquired two hundred acres more from his friend and made
a cash payment for the whole. Meanwhile, he had patented another
small body of land south of the river. It was probably in the year 1741
that he began building on a spot whence he could look downward at
a stream or upward toward the mountains; and it was here that Thomas
was born two years later.

The domain in this district to which the boy became heir apparent
was modest. The acreage to which Peter had title was not extensive by
Virginia standards and was not immediately increased. In that era of
land-grabbing he received large grants elsewhere but there is no certain
way of knowing how many of these he was ever able to perfect; and
on one occasion the all-powerful Council administered a distinct rebuff
by rejecting one of his petitions as unreasonable. He may have
over-reached himself, but in view of the success of others it seems more
probable that, despite his connection with the Randolphs, he lacked
influence at the seat of power. On the whole, he was a modest speculator
in land, in comparison with his mighty contemporaries in the
Province, and even with certain of his near neighbors.

In the Rivanna region, however, he had the distinction of being one
of the first settlers, and this was always a matter of pride to his son.
Though unexpected events interrupted his stay, Peter played an important
part in the organization of a County which boasts many distinguished
sons but has been most glorified by the name of Jefferson. In
September, 1744, because of the inconvenience attending the upper
inhabitants of Goochland, the Assembly provided that after the last
day of December the existing County should be divided and a new one
bearing the euphonious name of Albemarle be formed. Peter Jefferson,
who had been a magistrate in the old County, attended the first meeting
for organization in February, 1745, and took oath as a justice of the
peace and a judge of the court of chancery, thus becoming one of the
first magistrates and first gentlemen of the new one. Associated with
him on this occasion was Joshua Fry, a former teacher of mathematics
at the College of William and Mary, who was now living on Hardware
River, near Carter's Bridge. In March, Fry became county surveyor
and county lieutenant -- that is, the chief officer -- while Peter Jefferson
became lieutenant colonel. After a few weeks, however, he practically
ceased attending meetings of the county court in Albemarle, and he
soon returned to the Goochland side, taking his young family with
him.


His return was at the request of his friend William Randolph, now
also referred to as "Colonel," who had suffered other misfortunes than
that of becoming his own master too soon. He had married early and
well, but by the age of thirty had become a widower. His wife was
the daughter of Mann Page, whose house at Rosewell in Gloucester
County is said to have contained thirty-five rooms. John Page, the
companion of Thomas Jefferson's youth and young manhood, was her
nephew. She had borne William Randolph two daughters and a son,
who was given the names of his two grandfathers. Thomas Mann Randolph
was a couple of years older than Thomas Jefferson, who could
say afterwards that he had known him all his life. After his wife died,
William of Tuckahoe made a will wherein he named Peter as one of
his executors. Three years later, foreseeing his approaching death, he
added a codicil in which he included the request that his "dear and
loving friend" should move down with his own family to the Tuckahoe
house and remain there until Randolph's son was grown.

In the technical sense Peter Jefferson was not the guardian of Thomas
Mann Randolph, but the children remained at Tuckahoe with the
Jefferson family. Large monetary bequests had been made to the girls
and the balance of the estate was to go to the son. As the resident
executor Peter was the custodian of the land, and in the practical sense
he was far more than a guardian. His economic status was considerably
more modest than that of William Randolph, but in view of his
standing as magistrate and friend it seems impossible that he could have
been asked to assume an undignified position. In general he did such
things at Tuckahoe as the master himself would have done had he been
there, doubtless doing most of them a good deal better. It is surprising,
however, that he should have been willing to leave his own lands in
order to care for those of another. Besides being an act of loyal friendship,
his move must have seemed advantageous to both families.

He directed the activities of at least seven overseers at Tuckahoe and
reported the production of far more tobacco on Colonel Randolph's
quarters than he could have expected from his own fields in Albemarle.
His smaller holdings there were still largely forested and he
probably thought it desirable to leave the task of pioneering to an
overseer and his gang. Planters often did that before moving their
families into new lands in the Piedmont. While at Tuckahoe he could
keep his eye on his Fine Creek property, which lay near one of the
Randolph quarters. Peter Jefferson kept his accounts methodically, as
his son did afterwards, but those which remain do not reveal how much
he received for his services to the estate. The traditional report that
he got only his living expenses is probably correct, but the food and
lodging of his growing family constituted a considerable item and
he was unquestionably a more prosperous man after this period than
he had been before.

Though he did not stay as long as William of Tuckahoe had desired,
he guarded the land and the heir for six or seven years altogether.
Thus it came about that the home of Thomas Jefferson's earliest
remembrance was a Randolph place. The Colonel achieved his reputation
as an explorer while they were all living there. Then, during the few
years that remained to him after their return to Albemarle, he gained
greater local prominence and developed the estate which his son
inherited.


II
The Services of Peter Jefferson

1745-1757

THE EARLIEST recollection of Thomas Jefferson was of being
carried on a pillow by a mounted slave on the journey from
Shadwell to Tuckahoe. The circumstances must have been specially
impressive, for he was only two or three years old at the time. He
had now ceased to be the youngest member of the family but he was
still the only boy. At the age of twenty months he had acquired a
third sister, and a fourth was born shortly after he turned three. Two
more boys were born at Tuckahoe, but one lived only a few weeks
and the other did not survive a day. The five young Jeffersons and
the three young Randolphs comprised a good-sized group of children,
and doubtless a lively one.

If the house was then completed in its historic external form, as
seems probable, they could have lived almost as two separate families,
thereby diminishing domestic confusion to some degree. It had two
distinct wings which were connected by a large room or salon, and
thus it assumed the shape of the letter "H." One of the wings had brick
ends, but otherwise it was a frame structure, painted white. At that
time it may not have contained the fine panelling and rich stairways
which were seen in it later, but the rooms had high ceilings and were
airy. Jefferson was there as a little boy and he often stopped with
Thomas Mann Randolph after he grew up, but he saw no reason to
describe such a familiar house in letters. Architecture of this sort did
not impress him after he was attracted to classic columns and had
begun to dream of stateliness; but this home of his first memories, set
above a greater stream than the Rivanna, always must have seemed an
exceedingly pleasant place.

Colonel Jefferson was directly charged to carry out William Randolph's
instructions about the education of his son. The heir was not
to be sent to the College of William and Mary or to England on any
account whatever, but private tutors were to be employed for his
instruction. Thus the credible tradition arose that young Tom Jefferson
first studied under young Tom Randolph's teacher in a little house
still standing in the yard. This part of his education he afterwards
described as "the English school," without giving any details. Presumably,
the tutor taught the boys and girls together, as Philip Fithian
did in the household of Councillor Robert Carter at Nomini Hall; but
even in that case this class, like all the others he was ever a member of,
was small. In the absence of authentic information, his boyhood and
schooldays at Tuckahoe must be left to the imagination. It is said that
once, when desperate with hunger, he fervently repeated the Lord's
Prayer in the hope of hastening a meal. The implication is clear that
he received conventional religious instruction, but there is certainly no
suggestion that there was any shortage of food. In this and in other
respects his father was a good provider.


Peter Jefferson was more than that. He was not merely providing
a comfortable home for his family while doing a service to a dead
friend. He was also venturing far from the tobacco fields upon occasion
and carving a reputation for himself out of the wilderness. If his
career is at all memorable for its own sake, and not solely as a brief
prologue to one that was illustrious, it is because of what he did as a
surveyor of boundaries and a maker of maps during the years that he
had headquarters at Tuckahoe. This record of exploits and achievements
constituted, also, the most distinctive part of the heritage that he
transmitted to his descendants.

We have a detailed account of one of the expeditions he went on.
His son was not yet four years old when Peter helped mark what was
known afterwards as the Fairfax Line. It is a pity that the boy was
not old enough to hear the story of this hazardous adventure while
the father's memory of it was fresh. The Colonel was never much of
a talker, however; he was a man of action.


Between the Potomac and the Rappahannock lay the vast domain of
Lord Fairfax known as the Northern Neck. It was a part of the Province
of Virginia so far as government was concerned, but title to the
soil lay with the Proprietor. The western limits of this princely estate
were long the subject of dispute; but finally, by order of the Privy
Council, the boundary was drawn for seventy-six miles between the
headspring of the Rappahannock, that is, the source of the Conway or
Rapidan, across mountain ranges and primeval wilderness to the headspring
of the Potomac, which was already marked. This was the Fairfax
Line.

The members of the expedition who assembled below the Blue Ridge
in September, 1746, comprised some forty men, and at the start they
had about that many horses. There were commissioners for the Crown
and for Lord Fairfax, the former including Joshua Fry of Albemarle
County, and there were surveyors who had been deputed by these
gentlemen. Colonel Jefferson and Robert Brooke had been named for
the Crown, Captain Benjamin Winslow and Thomas Lewis for the
Proprietor. It was Lewis who recorded in crude but graphic language
the story of the journey. The journey out, from the head of the Conway
(Rapidan) to the headspring of the Potomac, where they drank
the King's health and set up the Fairfax stone, required four weeks.
The trip back to the starting point, where they drank healths even
more lustily and set up another stone, took three.

The preparations had been elaborate but this was no pleasure trip
even for the commissioners, who generally went with the baggage by
the easiest route. Colonel Jefferson and the other surveyors had to
follow the direct line wherever it went, though they always remained
mounted as long as they could. It took them over successive ranges of
mountains that were "prodigiously full of fallen timber and ivey," up
and down precipices where the horses slipped and fell, and through
swamps of laurel which appeared impenetrable. One dreadful place
they called Purgatory and one stream, dismal enough "to strike terror
in any human creature," they named the Styx. Several of the
unfortunate horses were killed, and all of them nearly starved. The surveyors
suffered repeated falls and were in constant danger. One of them
fainted in a swamp, which almost became his tomb. Colonel Jefferson
and Captain Winslow were older than the other two and they generally
went together when the group worked in pairs. For Peter at thirty-nine
the expedition was a feat of endurance, but the only sign of weakness
he gave was that once he was "much indisposed."

Thomas Jefferson never stood on the top of the Alleghanies where
his father crossed, nor saw the initials "P. J." carved on a beech near the
Fairfax Stone. The information about the topography of his native
region which he incorporated in his Notes on Virginia was gained
from several sources, but from his father he could have learned that
the mountains are "not solitary and scattered confusedly over the face
of the country," but are "disposed in ridges one behind another." He
appears not to have referred in writing to his father's connection with
the Fairfax Line, but undoubtedly he knew of Peter's victories over the
wilderness and was heartened by them, though he himself was an
explorer and a pioneer of another sort.

On November 15, 1746, after the senior surveyor for the Crown had
carved his initials on a birch tree near the head of Conway, he set out
for home. The other surveyors joined him at Tuckahoe early in the
new year, and by the last week in February their joint labors were
completed. At a greater age Tom would have been deeply interested
in their doings. The map of the Northern Neck that was sent to England
was described as drawn by Peter Jefferson and Robert Brooke.
For the region east of the Blue Ridge they followed the earlier map
of Mayo but they incorporated enough new material about the Valley
of Virginia to give their own map the value of a source record.
Needless to say, this map showed for the first time the Fairfax
Line.

The name of Joshua Fry is linked with that of Peter Jefferson in
the most important of the latter's activities as a surveyor. In effect if
not in fact the two men constituted a partnership. Somewhat more than
three years after they helped set up the Fairfax Stone, they surveyed
the dividing line between Virginia and North Carolina for ninety miles
beyond the point where William Byrd and his fellow commissioners
had left it a score of years before. Unfortunately, no chronicler was
present to record their exploits, and, except for his "plan," such documents
as the junior surveyor left appear to have been destroyed.

The Byrd party had carried the line to Peter's Creek. In the fall of
1749 Colonel Fry and Colonel Jefferson extended it to Steep Rock
Creek, in what is now Washington County. The plan itself shows that
they crossed New River and many small streams and several ranges of
mountains. The hardships and perils that they met must have been
talked about in Tom's presence, for they became a tradition in his
family. Years later his grandchildren repeated stories which must have
come through him: that these men had to defend themselves against
wild beasts by day, and to sleep in the trees at night; that their
provisions ran low and they had to live on raw flesh; that Peter's courage
did not fail when his companions fainted from exhaustion beside him.

He and Fry went further than they had gone when drawing the
Fairfax Line and both of them were now older. For their extraordinary
trouble and painful service, however, they did not go unrewarded.
Before the end of the year they reported their proceedings to the
Council, produced an account of their expenses, and presented their
maps. Then the members of that body unanimously agreed that each
of them was deserving of three hundred pounds sterling beyond all
expenses. Nor were their abilities forgotten. Some months later the
Acting Governor, following a directive from the Lords of Trade,
selected them as the best qualified persons to draw a map of the
inhabited part of Virginia. In October, 1751, the Honorable Lewis Burwell,
whose daughter was wooed unsuccessfully by the son of Peter
Jefferson, asked the opinion of the Council in regard to their
compensation. Each was thought deserving of one hundred and fifty pounds
sterling for his expense and trouble.

Their map was done by that time, and, unlike the original materials
on which it was based, it has withstood the ravages of fire and time for
the simple reason that it was printed. It appeared in London in 1751;
and a second edition, containing improvements by John Dalrymple,
chiefly in the form of wagon roads, was issued four years later. This
second map was reproduced in successive atlases, and its superiority to
all others up to the time that Thomas Jefferson compiled his Notes on
Virginia was generally recognized. For geographical knowledge of his
native country, therefore, he and his contemporaries were deeply indebted
to his father. John Henry, father of Patrick, published a map
in 1770, but this was not based on original surveys and it has generally
been regarded as an inaccurate compilation. Jefferson subscribed for
it, but he probably had no more respect for it than he had for the legal
training of John Henry's son.

Soon after his map was published, Peter returned to Shadwell from
Tuckahoe. His record of the tobacco crops on Colonel Randolph's
quarters ends with 1751; thenceforth he farmed his own lands and
rounded out his own estate. He drew no more major boundary lines,
but he was county surveyor in Goochland that year; he was again a
magistrate of Albemarle by the following spring, and a couple of years
after that he became county surveyor there in succession to Joshua
Fry, who had just died at Fort Cumberland while commanding the
Virginia forces on the frontier. George Washington was his lieutenant.
Fry has been credited with being the chief constructive influence in
the life of Peter Jefferson, and not improperly. His good will continued
to manifest itself after he was dead. He named his associate an executor
of his will, left him the surveying instruments which they had used
together, and in effect bequeathed him his major public offices.

Colonel Jefferson had been made the second military officer of
Albemarle when the County was formed. He now succeeded Fry as
county lieutenant and also as a member of the House of Burgesses.
He served during two sessions of the Assembly in 1754 and 1755 but
presumably he did not stand for re-election. His legislative career was
approximately as brief and unimportant as that of his father-in-law
Isham Randolph, but his service as county lieutenant appears to have
lasted until the end of his life. He did nothing in particular in the
French and Indian War, but he was the chief officer and the first citizen
of the County. During much of this time Tom was away from
home, at school in Goochland, but when the boy returned to look at
the mountains and flourish in the sunshine of Albemarle there could
be no doubt of his established position in the community.


Tom was about nine years old when the family moved back to
Shadwell. Not until after his father's death five years later did he
observe the full procession of the seasons in Albemarle; but he was here
during vacations at least, and henceforth this place was home. It
provided the domestic background of his life until he was twenty-seven.
No mansion ever stood on this homesite but his father erected a substantial
group of plantation buildings before he died. He either enlarged
the little house in which the boy had been born or built another
wooden structure for the central unit; and he added a dairy, smoke-house,
and other outbuildings of the sort until he had a frontage of
more than two hundred feet above the river. To the southward the
land sloped for several hundred yards to the Rivanna, where he had a
water mill. This occupied a good deal of his son's attention, later on.
The Three Notched Road passed the place on the north much as the
highway does today and, proceeding westward through the gap,
crossed the stream at the Secretary's Ford.

The ridge of the Southwest Mountains, which is broken at this gap,
enters the present County in the extreme northeast and there it reaches
its greatest height, fifteen hundred feet, in a knob which came to be
called Peter's Mountain for Colonel Jefferson. As his son said, all the
Virginia mountains run in the same direction, from northeast to southwest,
but these, being the first discovered, appropriated the latter name
to themselves. The range roughly parallels the Blue Ridge, about
twenty miles away. On its slopes Tom hunted, and beneath them many
of the first plantation houses nestled. There may have been better sites
on the western side, whence the eye could command the Blue Ridge,
but settlers had been attracted first to the eastern, which faced the
sunrise. Properties ran in generous strips from the wooded summits to
the lowlands. The largest of these dated back to a grant of more than
thirteen thousand acres to Nicholas Meriwether which was referred to
as "the Grant" because it was so early and so huge. This included the
site of Castle Hill, some eight miles from Shadwell, though no plantation
house had been erected there as yet. A considerable part of this
lordly estate eventually came into the possession of Dr. Thomas
Walker. Wherever he may have been living when the Jeffersons
came back, he soon served Peter as a friend and his son John afterwards
became intimate with Tom. Closer at hand was John Harvie, who had
bought lands adjoining the William Randolph property. It is uncertain
just when he built Belmont but from an early time he was a near neighbor
 -- as nearness was understood in Albemarle.

The Shadwell tract proper consisted of only four hundred acres but
Colonel Jefferson soon purchased the place on the same side of the river
that was later known as Pantops. His son always liked this because of
its magnificent view. South of the river Peter's lands stretched toward
Carter's Mountain and included not only the site of Monticello but also
a small tract which he had patented in 1740 and which was known as
Partibello. To this he now added another of the same size called
Tufton. He also patented a body of woodland which is identified on
Thomas Jefferson's land roll as "Pouncey's." Approximately two thousand
six hundred and fifty acres that the latter afterwards held in this
part of the County were acquired by his father. Peter Jefferson was
also increasing his holdings and developing his lands in another part of
Albermarle. Three more children joined the family after the removal
from Tuckahoe, including the twins, one of whom was a boy named
Randolph. Peter built up for his sons two estates of practically the
same size, one centering at Shadwell and the other on the South Fork
of the James, sometimes called the Fluvanna.

Soon after the County was formed the Assembly had empowered
him, Joshua Fry, and others to expend one hundred pounds in clearing
the latter stream of rocks, which in several places obstructed navigation.
It was broader there than the North Branch or Rivanna and, unlike it,
served an important function in starting the money crop on the way
to market. While the Jeffersons were still at Tuckahoe there had been
a notable advance in the use of canoes above the fall line. This was
owing to the ingenuity of the Reverend Robert Rose, a large planter,
who lashed two of these "tottering vehicles" together and thus enabled
them to carry eight or nine hogsheads of tobacco at a time without
tipping. Peter's tobacco from the Rivanna district had to go by land,
either by wagon or by the crude method of rolling in specially
constructed hogsheads, but he was able to employ water transportation
on the Fluvanna. His main place there he named Snowdon after the
mountains in Wales near the reputed home of his ancestors. In his lifetime
the Fluvanna district was the more important part of the County.
The courthouse was there, near the present town of Scottsville. He
was one of the persons who had determined the location, and he owned
houses at the ferry crossing which he leased to the keeper of an ordinary.
This was about twenty-five miles from Shadwell.

Not until the region below the Fluvanna had been separated from
Albemarle, after Thomas Jefferson went to college, was the town of
Charlottesville established by law and the courthouse located there.
It was built on its present site, about four miles west of Shadwell. This
was too late to do Peter Jefferson any good but it was a convenience
to his son as a practising lawyer. Even during the Revolution the county
seat contained little besides a courthouse, a tavern, and a dozen houses.
A traveler then observed that the region, when viewed from one of its
many eminences, appeared as a vast forest, interspersed with plantations
four or five miles apart and resembling small villages. This was no
land of bustling towns, nor predominantly of small farms. As a rule
holdings were larger than in the Shenandoah Valley, though smaller
than in Tidewater. When Peter Jefferson knew the region and his son
was a boy, this was a silent country of far-flung patriarchal seats, though
these were without architectural pretension. Afterwards, plain farmhouses
on smaller clearings increased in number.

In the bottoms and on the lower slopes the red soil was rich in its
virginal state, before it was exhausted by tobacco or ravaged by
erosion. The temperate climate was favorable to Virginia's historic crop,
and also to the fruit trees and grains which Peter Jefferson's son
afterwards encouraged, while the dogwood, the redbud, and the shadbush
made this a sylvan Paradise in spring. By all prevailing standards the
district was healthful. The inhabitants often spoke of themselves as
mountaineers and congratulated themselves on their freedom from
agues and fevers. Before Thomas Jefferson was grown one of them
said: "The descent of our lands is so quick, that morasses are scarcely
known among us, and the rapidity of our waters so great that none of
them has leisure to stagnate." But the very rapidity of these waters
increased the difficulties of transportation -- which, more than any
other single factor, distinguished the Piedmont from the region of the
lower James. The large planters had slaves to perform the cruder tasks
of pioneering, and they brought with them the agricultural economy
and the social traditions of Tidewater; but in this isolated region they
could not reproduce precisely the life of Westover or Turkey Island,
or even of Tuckahoe. Styles were simpler here, self-sufficiency was
more imperative, and one might expect an even more notable spirit
of personal independence to be engendered.

For years after Peter Jefferson became a magistrate wolf bounties
were listed at sessions of the county court -- seventy pounds of tobacco
for a young wolf and twice that much for an old one. There were no
Indians here when the first settlers came, and during the French and
Indian War this was not among the frontier counties but in the tier
just before them. Fears of raids were voiced at that time but this had
ceased to be a frontier region in the precise sense. Despite its vast body
of uncleared lands it had an ordered, if dispersed, society. Nevertheless,
residents of Albemarle remembered that Joshua Fry and Peter
Jefferson had penetrated uncharted country, and men associated with
the County followed their example. Thomas Walker of Castle Hill
carried on the dividing line from the point where they had left it; and
George Rogers Clark, who was born across the Southwest Mountains
from Shadwell just about the time that Peter returned, conquered the
Northwest during the Revolution. His younger and equally redheaded
brother, William Clark, was born in another county after his family had
left this one, but Meriwether Lewis, whose name is linked with his in
the history of exploration, was a native. Under the direction of President
Jefferson they crossed a continent. The tradition of the wilderness
persisted in Albemarle.

In this congenial locality Peter Jefferson kept on surveying lands and
developing his farms until his great strength began to fail. Despite his
reputed ability to "head up" two hogsheads of tobacco at the same
time, he died when he was still less than fifty. His elder son, then
lanky at fourteen, was never to be quite that strong but was destined
to live much longer. Perhaps the sire had given too freely of a strength
that had seemed so abundant; perhaps he had exposed himself to too
many hardships. Or it may be that the unknown malady which assailed
him in the summer of 1757 could have been cured at a later stage in
the progress of medicine. There were only two physicians in the County
at the time and their practice was incidental. Dr. Walker, who attended
him, is best known to history as an explorer and land-speculator. His
professional visits to his friend were numerous and his services were
as skillful as could have been expected. They were unavailing, however,
for the patient died on August 17.
