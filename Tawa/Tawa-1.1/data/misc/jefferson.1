jefferson
the
virginian
by
dumas
malone
i
jeffersons
and
randolphs
thomas
jefferson
was
born
in
a
simple
wooden
house
in
what
is
now
albermarle
county
virginia
at
that
time
the
district
was
in
the
county
of
goochland
and
virginia
was
a
province
of
king
george
ii
of
great
britain
by
the
calendar
then
in
effect
the
birthday
was
april
but
according
to
the
new
style
which
was
adopted
when
jefferson
was
still
a
boy
it
was
april
and
thus
it
has
been
celebrated
through
the
years
this
was
a
delicious
season
for
the
air
of
the
virginia
piedmont
is
soft
in
april
the
dogwood
soon
opens
in
the
woods
and
the
wild
honeysuckle
begins
to
bloom
the
house
has
long
since
vanished
but
the
site
is
marked
and
anybody
who
goes
there
now
can
see
that
it
was
well
chosen
to
the
southward
it
overlooks
the
rivanna
river
often
referred
to
then
as
the
north
river
or
north
branch
of
the
james
this
is
now
a
muddy
and
unimpressive
stream
but
it
once
was
purer
the
prospect
to
the
west
is
finer
for
on
any
clear
day
the
distant
blue
ridge
can
be
seen
through
a
gap
in
the
southwest
mountains
the
place
was
called
shadwell
peter
jefferson
who
owned
it
had
named
if
for
the
parish
in
london
where
his
wife
jane
randolph
had
been
christened
twenty
three
years
before
the
setting
did
not
suggest
the
thames
basin
or
hanoverian
england
however
this
was
not
a
rainy
but
generally
a
sunny
land
and
it
had
no
antiquity
or
mellowness
for
as
a
seat
of
settlement
it
was
almost
wholly
new
the
hardwood
forests
which
covered
the
bottom
lands
and
steep
hillsides
were
broken
by
only
a
few
clearings
where
the
red
soil
glowed
and
the
first
wails
of
this
newborn
infant
could
have
been
echoed
by
the
howling
of
the
wolves
the
earliest
surroundings
of
this
natural
philosopher
were
beautiful
but
they
were
wild
jefferson
was
born
on
the
fringe
of
western
settlement
and
some
will
say
that
he
thus
became
a
child
of
the
american
frontier
no
influence
upon
him
was
more
abiding
than
that
of
nature
and
throughout
life
he
deeply
loved
this
region
of
wooded
hills
and
lavender
tinted
mountains
but
shadwell
was
not
the
home
of
his
earliest
memories
when
he
was
two
or
three
years
old
he
was
taken
from
it
to
tuckahoe
on
the
james
to
an
older
and
better
house
in
a
more
thickly
settled
district
at
that
time
no
parts
of
virginia
were
thickly
settled
with
a
few
exceptions
the
entire
province
was
a
vast
forest
tobacco
plantations
and
their
seats
were
strung
loosely
along
the
rivers
but
to
all
european
observers
the
clearings
seemed
small
and
the
country
looked
uninhabited
the
vastness
of
this
physical
setting
was
not
lost
upon
thomas
jefferson
it
was
reflected
in
the
largeness
of
the
mind
furthermore
this
society
as
a
whole
was
closer
to
the
frontier
than
later
generations
might
at
first
realize
but
jefferson
was
in
albemarle
only
intermittently
during
his
boyhood
and
he
knew
the
region
best
after
the
fringe
of
settlement
stretched
well
beyond
it
he
as
used
to
sparsely
settled
country
but
he
did
not
know
the
frontier
by
experience
and
though
he
was
always
aware
of
the
wilderness
he
was
not
in
the
physical
sense
an
explorer
peter
jefferson
a
man
of
huge
stature
and
legendary
strength
was
in
his
mid
thirties
in
he
performed
memorable
deeds
as
a
surveyor
in
uncharted
country
in
later
years
but
at
no
time
was
he
a
typical
frontiersman
he
was
not
yet
at
the
height
of
his
fortunes
though
he
was
a
slaveowner
and
he
had
other
lands
below
the
james
thirty
miles
or
so
to
the
southeast
where
he
had
previously
lived
he
was
no
landless
pioneer
but
an
enterprising
young
planter
who
may
have
ventured
a
bit
too
far
to
the
westward
in
this
instance
he
had
been
there
several
years
however
he
had
intended
to
stay
and
he
may
already
have
planned
the
extensive
group
of
plantation
buildings
he
eventually
erected
he
built
only
a
modest
unit
at
first
and
it
was
to
this
plain
house
that
he
had
brought
his
wife
and
two
little
daughters
the
year
before
his
third
child
and
first
son
was
born
jane
randolph
may
not
have
liked
the
extreme
remoteness
of
shadwell
and
probably
was
glad
that
her
first
stay
there
was
short
the
most
important
early
fact
about
thomas
jefferson
is
not
that
he
appeared
on
the
edge
of
settlement
but
that
he
was
born
in
the
province
of
virginia
and
that
from
his
first
days
he
was
numbered
among
its
gentry
he
was
not
born
to
physical
hardship
as
abraham
lincoln
was
he
did
not
know
town
life
from
boyhood
as
benjamin
franklin
did
in
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term
he
was
no
self
made
man
he
grew
up
in
the
generous
society
which
had
been
created
in
a
new
country
and
a
warm
climate
by
a
group
of
planters
cultivating
tobacco
and
relying
on
slave
labor
from
his
earliest
memories
his
financial
position
was
assured
and
the
best
educational
opportunities
which
the
colony
afforded
were
later
available
to
him
he
gave
chief
thanks
to
his
father
for
all
this
and
he
himself
would
have
made
peter
jefferson
the
dominant
character
in
his
early
history
but
this
plantation
society
centered
in
families
and
thomas
jefferson
s
history
necessarily
begins
as
a
story
of
a
family
or
rather
of
two
families
and
how
they
merged
jefferson
s
connections
stood
him
in
good
stead
while
he
was
growing
up
and
he
always
valued
them
on
personal
grounds
but
he
never
spent
much
of
his
previous
time
on
the
remote
subject
of
genealogy
as
a
young
man
he
was
not
wholly
indifferent
to
his
ancestry
but
in
the
ripeness
of
age
he
made
light
of
it
and
there
are
a
number
of
people
now
living
who
know
more
about
it
than
he
did
to
him
the
degree
of
their
interest
would
seem
surprising
for
he
was
more
interested
in
the
origins
of
laws
and
institutions
than
in
the
beginnings
of
any
particular
family
and
he
belonged
to
the
school
of
thought
which
magnified
the
influence
of
environment
and
minimized
heredity
too
much
probably
the
progenitor
in
whom
he
took
greatest
pride
was
his
father
and
this
because
of
what
peter
jefferson
did
rather
than
what
he
inherited
his
father
was
a
man
of
deeds
not
words
but
there
is
indication
that
this
inarticulate
squire
set
considerable
store
by
family
traditions
the
naming
of
shadwell
showed
that
although
jane
randolph
may
have
made
the
original
suggestion
furthermore
he
afterwards
had
a
place
on
the
fluvanna
river
which
he
called
snowdon
after
a
mountain
in
wales
near
which
the
jeffersons
were
supposed
once
to
have
lived
whether
they
ever
did
seems
to
be
beyond
the
possibility
of
historical
verification
and
the
matter
is
of
no
real
importance
if
they
were
originally
welsh
they
had
become
predominantly
english
after
they
had
lived
for
several
generations
in
virginia
thomas
jefferson
s
own
knowledge
of
his
paternal
ancestry
went
back
only
to
his
grandfather
after
whom
he
was
named
the
line
can
be
traced
with
certainty
only
one
step
further
to
an
obscure
man
whom
we
shall
call
thomas
jefferson
i
for
the
purposes
of
this
story
he
was
a
farmer
naturally
enough
and
by
the
year
he
was
living
in
henrico
county
which
was
then
much
larger
than
it
now
is
considerably
below
the
present
location
of
richmond
he
was
in
the
curls
region
so
called
because
of
the
eccentricities
of
the
james
river
which
in
one
stretch
of
six
miles
managed
to
meaner
through
sixteen
this
was
in
the
low
and
level
tidewater
country
overspread
with
heavy
forests
and
flowering
shrubs
where
practically
all
of
the
virginians
then
were
as
far
to
the
west
as
settlers
dared
go
lived
an
exceedingly
enterprising
man
named
william
byrd
from
the
falls
of
the
james
he
dispatched
traders
into
the
carolinas
to
barter
with
the
indians
in
thomas
jefferson
i
who
himself
had
moved
further
westward
had
a
small
business
transaction
with
this
magnate
he
bought
from
him
a
parcel
of
land
consisting
of
about
one
hundred
and
sixty
seven
acres
technically
he
was
then
a
squatter
on
this
very
piece
of
property
though
the
presumption
is
that
nobody
thought
his
conduct
at
all
reprehensible
the
governor
finding
that
the
land
had
escheated
to
the
king
had
granted
it
to
another
who
had
assigned
it
to
the
acquisitive
byrd
and
the
latter
at
length
sold
it
to
the
occupant
for
a
valuable
consideration
the
real
moral
of
the
tale
is
that
neither
in
financial
power
nor
worldly
wisdom
were
the
early
jeffersons
a
match
for
the
early
byrds
on
the
other
hand
this
ancestor
of
a
president
must
have
had
some
capital
and
apparently
he
was
not
the
sort
of
farmer
who
could
be
easily
evicted
by
a
richer
man
presumably
this
was
the
place
where
his
son
lived
afterwards
if
so
it
was
on
the
south
bank
of
the
river
some
twenty
miles
below
the
falls
and
strategically
situated
for
a
landing
at
this
time
there
were
land
barons
in
virginia
to
whom
such
holdings
seemed
small
and
such
a
man
inconsequential
but
the
heyday
of
the
plantation
aristocracy
had
not
yet
arrived
though
the
economic
and
social
structure
of
the
colony
was
taking
form
it
had
not
attained
rigidity
life
was
dispersed
and
fluid
in
this
spacious
country
and
here
for
many
years
yet
vigorous
and
ambitious
men
had
an
excellent
chance
to
rise
this
was
an
unequal
society
in
an
age
of
recognized
inequality
but
except
for
the
lowest
group
the
slaves
it
was
not
one
of
rigid
caste
the
road
to
riches
and
power
lay
open
to
those
who
acquired
land
while
it
was
still
easy
to
get
and
who
somehow
found
labor
with
which
to
exploit
it
the
distinct
advantage
lay
with
those
who
had
influence
and
capital
labor
was
always
scarcer
than
land
and
slaves
rather
than
acreage
came
to
be
the
major
criterion
of
prosperity
but
no
one
had
many
slaves
or
much
ready
money
in
the
late
seventeenth
century
and
the
status
of
a
small
landowner
who
tilled
a
virgin
soil
was
far
from
degraded
his
life
was
undoubtedly
crude
but
nature
was
prodigal
and
the
future
beckoned
the
first
thomas
jefferson
probably
had
little
capital
or
influence
but
he
went
forward
on
the
road
to
fortune
and
a
genteel
station
besides
bearing
and
transmitting
a
good
name
he
increased
his
holdings
and
became
a
man
of
respectable
estate
he
acquired
no
military
title
but
judging
from
the
number
of
wolf
bounties
he
collected
he
had
some
prowess
as
a
hunter
he
became
one
of
ye
surveyours
of
ye
highways
thus
establishing
a
tradition
in
the
family
he
frequently
did
jury
duty
and
as
a
man
of
recognized
integrity
he
served
several
times
as
an
executor
of
wills
his
wife
mary
branch
brought
him
some
property
and
when
he
dies
in
he
had
several
slaves
besides
his
widow
mary
he
left
a
son
thomas
and
a
daughter
martha
these
three
names
kept
reappearing
in
the
family
with
unfailing
regularity
they
were
all
present
at
monticello
it
would
be
easy
to
make
too
much
of
the
fact
that
mary
branch
jefferson
three
years
after
she
became
a
widow
married
a
man
who
could
sign
the
wedding
contract
only
by
making
his
mark
for
her
second
husband
joseph
mattocks
had
property
and
she
herself
could
write
her
name
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
however
that
either
she
or
her
first
husband
was
a
cultivated
person
probably
there
was
no
time
in
the
history
of
this
province
when
it
was
more
difficult
to
become
one
before
the
establishment
of
the
college
of
william
and
mary
practically
the
only
educational
opportunities
were
those
that
england
provided
a
few
of
the
very
rich
the
result
was
a
generation
of
men
who
if
they
had
the
good
fortune
to
read
and
write
had
no
further
commerce
with
the
muses
or
learned
sciences
but
spent
their
life
ignobly
at
the
hoe
and
spade
and
other
employments
of
an
uncultivated
and
unpolished
country
not
until
the
greatest
of
the
name
appeared
did
any
of
the
jeffersons
have
much
learning
but
the
lack
of
it
was
too
general
at
this
time
to
constitute
an
insuperable
bar
to
admission
into
the
lesser
gentry
whether
or
not
the
first
thomas
jefferson
should
be
called
a
yeoman
is
a
question
of
definition
and
a
matter
of
no
real
consequence
the
second
of
the
name
as
officially
a
gentleman
before
the
end
of
the
century
thomas
ii
owned
a
racing
mare
and
racing
was
generally
a
prerogative
of
the
gentry
more
significant
than
this
is
the
fact
that
he
became
one
of
the
gentleman
justices
of
henrico
county
before
he
was
thirty
and
that
he
continued
to
be
one
for
almost
twenty
years
among
his
honorable
associates
were
the
second
william
randolph
and
an
early
francis
eppes
these
highly
reputable
names
reappear
in
the
story
of
his
descendants
besides
being
a
local
magistrate
he
was
a
captain
of
the
militia
the
officers
generally
dined
together
after
muster
and
upon
one
of
these
occasions
colonel
william
byrd
second
of
the
name
and
the
elegant
master
of
westover
ate
roast
beef
at
jefferson
s
house
for
at
least
two
years
the
captain
held
the
important
post
of
sheriff
at
henrico
as
a
justice
might
have
been
expected
to
do
and
he
was
once
recompensed
for
extraordinary
services
he
is
said
to
have
built
a
church
in
bristol
parish
which
was
called
jefferson
s
church
for
half
a
century
there
is
no
clue
to
his
personality
but
he
must
have
been
vigorous
and
there
can
be
no
question
of
his
official
standing
or
sense
of
public
responsibility
in
this
society
the
two
were
inseparable
soon
after
his
father
s
death
and
shortly
before
he
attained
his
majority
he
married
mary
field
daughter
of
major
peter
field
of
new
kent
county
and
his
wife
judith
who
was
the
widow
of
henry
randolph
and
the
daughter
of
a
former
speaker
of
the
house
of
burgesses
from
both
the
financial
and
social
point
of
view
this
was
an
advantageous
alliance
he
received
grants
of
land
on
several
occasions
for
the
importation
of
persons
into
the
colony
and
he
engaged
in
numerous
land
transactions
after
the
manner
of
the
enterprising
planters
of
his
day
though
not
on
the
vast
scale
of
the
byrds
the
randolphs
and
the
carters
the
grant
of
fifteen
hundred
acres
on
fine
creek
south
of
the
james
and
well
above
the
falls
which
was
made
to
him
and
three
others
by
governor
spotswood
in
anticipated
the
westward
movement
in
which
his
son
took
part
he
himself
had
his
house
at
what
was
repeatedly
referred
to
as
jefferson
s
landing
later
described
as
osborne
s
here
on
the
last
day
of
february
his
son
peter
was
born
there
were
three
children
already
judith
thomas
and
field
and
later
there
were
two
more
daughters
bearing
the
inevitable
names
mary
and
martha
when
peter
was
eight
he
lost
his
mother
and
his
father
appears
to
have
remarried
later
though
the
captain
was
again
a
widower
when
he
died
long
years
afterward
writing
his
autobiography
at
monticello
thomas
jefferson
said
that
his
father
s
mind
was
naturally
strong
but
that
his
education
had
been
neglected
in
comparison
with
thomas
s
superior
opportunities
peter
s
was
unquestionably
limited
as
were
those
of
so
many
others
in
that
dispersed
society
he
did
not
grow
up
in
such
ignorance
as
to
be
seriously
handicapped
in
practical
affairs
but
the
accident
of
his
position
within
the
family
may
have
caused
him
to
be
relatively
neglected
he
lost
his
mother
while
he
was
still
a
child
and
as
the
youngest
of
three
sons
he
had
only
modest
expectations
in
his
youth
attention
was
probably
centered
in
the
heir
apparent
the
third
thomas
who
was
born
in
and
dies
twenty
three
years
later
on
a
ship
commanded
by
captain
isham
randolph
peter
jefferson
himself
afterwards
married
this
captain
randolph
s
daughter
though
there
can
be
no
question
of
the
honorable
standing
of
peter
s
father
the
second
thomas
jefferson
there
is
considerable
doubt
about
the
degree
of
his
prosperity
in
the
last
decade
of
his
life
he
suffered
a
heavy
loss
from
fire
which
occasioned
him
to
petition
the
house
of
burgesses
for
relief
and
a
few
years
later
when
he
failed
to
context
a
suit
against
him
for
of
tobacco
the
court
ordered
an
attachment
of
his
property
sufficient
to
satisfy
his
debt
the
will
which
he
drew
six
years
before
his
death
in
and
the
inventory
which
ultimately
went
with
it
show
that
he
had
considerably
more
household
goods
livestock
and
servants
than
thomas
jefferson
i
had
had
but
they
leave
many
unanswered
questions
about
his
land
neither
peter
nor
his
elder
brother
field
lived
on
the
ancestral
acres
after
their
father
died
as
a
justice
of
the
peace
in
lunenburg
field
maintained
the
connection
of
the
family
with
the
county
gentry
peter
who
was
named
his
father
s
executor
got
the
holdings
on
fine
and
manikin
creeks
in
goochland
county
and
if
he
did
not
already
live
on
them
he
soon
began
to
his
inheritance
of
land
was
probably
fair
sized
though
certainly
not
princely
besides
this
he
received
the
bulk
of
his
father
s
personal
possessions
including
half
of
the
livestock
a
couple
of
horses
and
two
slaves
presumably
body
servants
to
a
modest
extent
he
was
a
slaveowner
and
by
birth
and
association
he
was
a
member
of
the
country
gentry
he
cannot
be
described
as
a
completely
self
made
man
but
the
enhancement
of
his
fortunes
like
the
improvement
of
his
mind
must
be
chiefly
attributed
to
his
own
exertions
soon
after
he
presented
his
father
s
will
and
had
it
approved
in
the
county
court
he
removed
or
returned
to
fine
creek
he
was
then
about
twenty
five
years
old
and
at
the
peak
of
his
great
physical
strength
the
county
of
goochland
to
which
he
went
had
recently
been
set
off
from
henrico
it
lay
above
the
fall
line
and
straddled
the
james
peter
s
place
was
on
a
minor
tributary
to
the
south
of
the
river
here
he
lived
some
ten
years
until
about
developing
his
plantation
acquiring
claims
and
titles
elsewhere
and
gaining
for
himself
a
recognized
standing
in
the
district
the
date
of
his
definite
establishment
as
a
local
leader
was
when
he
followed
in
his
father
s
footsteps
by
becoming
a
justice
of
the
peace
three
years
later
when
he
was
thirty
he
became
sheriff
later
still
after
he
had
wandered
far
and
gained
laurels
elsewhere
he
was
county
surveyor
when
peter
first
came
to
goochland
the
strategic
post
of
surveyor
was
held
by
one
of
his
near
neighbors
william
mayo
probably
the
foremost
virginia
surveyor
of
his
time
mayo
helped
run
the
dividing
line
between
virginia
and
north
carolina
immortalized
by
the
second
william
byrd
peter
jefferson
who
afterwards
helped
extend
this
dividing
line
appears
to
have
accompanied
his
neighbor
on
some
of
his
later
trips
and
from
him
he
probably
acquired
the
elements
of
surveying
such
knowledge
was
immensely
useful
to
any
planter
and
it
played
an
important
part
in
peter
s
successful
career
as
it
did
in
that
of
george
washington
he
engaged
in
surveying
throughout
the
rest
of
his
life
and
by
means
of
it
won
for
himself
an
honorable
if
minor
place
in
the
history
of
american
exploration
on
the
other
side
of
the
james
from
fine
creek
and
fifteen
miles
or
more
to
the
eastward
was
tuckahoe
the
house
had
been
built
by
thomas
randolph
now
dead
who
had
been
the
foremost
citizen
of
the
new
county
he
as
one
of
the
seven
sons
of
william
randolph
of
turkey
island
and
is
generally
known
as
thomas
of
tuckahoe
the
custom
of
designating
individuals
by
their
plantation
seals
arose
naturally
in
a
society
which
made
a
practice
of
repeating
christian
names
from
generation
to
generation
and
it
has
proved
a
boon
to
confused
antiquarians
ever
since
it
became
a
virtual
necessity
among
the
innumerable
randolphs
no
inappropriately
have
william
of
turkey
island
and
his
wife
mary
isham
been
termed
the
adam
and
eve
of
virginia
bearers
of
the
randolph
name
sprouted
like
so
many
pine
trees
in
an
abandoned
field
and
many
of
them
became
monarchs
of
the
forest
if
descendants
through
maternal
lines
are
counted
the
long
roll
of
this
remarkable
clan
falls
little
short
of
comprising
the
entire
body
of
the
gentry
it
includes
the
names
of
thomas
jefferson
john
marshall
and
robert
e
lee
and
if
viewed
comprehensively
it
defies
comparison
with
any
other
american
family
peter
jefferson
s
first
close
contact
with
the
randolphs
came
through
the
young
master
of
tuckahoe
the
son
of
thomas
who
was
names
william
like
his
grandfather
and
one
of
his
uncles
thus
adding
to
the
genealogical
confusion
according
to
the
second
william
byrd
this
william
randolph
was
a
pretty
young
man
who
had
the
misfortune
to
become
his
own
master
too
soon
perhaps
he
was
not
sufficiently
deferential
to
the
colonel
that
urbane
gentleman
remarked
that
he
had
a
strange
conceit
of
his
won
sufficiency
which
was
accentuated
by
a
small
smattering
of
learning
william
of
tuckahoe
was
five
or
six
years
younger
than
peter
jefferson
who
by
all
accounts
was
modest
the
friendship
of
these
county
neighbors
may
have
been
a
case
of
the
attraction
of
opposites
or
merely
the
result
of
propinquity
in
a
fluid
and
friendly
society
the
two
young
men
became
magistrates
in
the
same
year
and
their
names
were
linked
from
that
time
forward
they
were
intimate
for
more
than
a
decade
and
almost
a
half
century
later
their
lines
were
joined
by
the
marriage
of
their
grandchildren
there
was
instability
in
this
branch
of
the
randolphs
and
beginning
with
peter
the
jeffersons
served
to
offset
it
on
the
same
side
of
the
river
as
tuckahoe
and
somewhat
west
of
fine
creek
was
a
place
called
dungeness
belonging
to
isham
randolph
uncle
of
young
william
the
eldest
of
the
many
children
there
was
a
girl
named
jane
she
was
nineteen
and
peter
jefferson
was
thirty
two
when
he
married
her
in
october
perhaps
the
courtship
began
a
couple
of
years
earlier
for
her
father
and
william
of
tuckahoe
had
shared
peter
s
bond
for
one
thousand
pounds
sterling
when
he
became
sheriff
isham
probably
knew
and
trusted
him
even
before
that
but
he
himself
had
not
yet
settled
down
at
dungeness
when
peter
first
came
to
goochland
isham
s
daughter
had
been
born
in
england
and
he
was
no
man
of
the
back
country
he
had
had
greater
opportunities
and
a
more
colorful
life
than
peter
s
father
isham
randolph
and
five
of
his
brothers
attended
the
college
of
william
and
mary
his
grandson
observed
afterwards
that
in
this
family
they
never
hesitated
to
employ
their
considerable
means
for
the
purposes
of
education
it
is
not
necessary
to
add
that
their
social
connections
were
of
the
best
while
isham
was
in
his
twenties
yet
unmarried
and
still
living
at
turkey
island
he
frequently
visited
westover
and
was
on
intimate
terms
with
captain
jefferson
s
superior
officer
in
the
militia
the
second
and
most
famous
william
byrd
who
was
twelve
years
older
than
young
randolph
for
some
weeks
in
the
winter
of
after
the
colonel
had
indiscreetly
offered
to
teach
him
french
isham
was
almost
continuously
at
westover
and
had
lessons
from
his
host
making
some
progress
but
his
chief
yearning
was
for
the
sea
and
byrd
helped
him
satisfy
it
by
recommending
him
for
the
command
of
a
ship
by
the
fall
of
that
year
he
was
referring
to
isham
as
captain
and
putting
tobacco
aboard
his
vessel
intimate
social
relations
between
the
two
men
were
maintained
during
byrd
s
later
residence
in
london
it
was
probably
in
that
captain
randolph
found
a
wife
in
england
his
marriage
to
jane
daughter
of
charles
and
jane
lilburne
rogers
took
place
in
the
parish
of
white
chapel
london
she
appears
to
have
been
living
with
her
widowed
mother
a
distant
relative
of
freeborn
john
lilburne
for
his
times
and
circumstances
isham
had
married
late
but
his
wife
proved
to
be
as
prolific
as
the
other
randolph
matrons
they
had
nine
children
who
survived
infancy
the
first
of
these
jane
was
baptized
at
st
paul
s
shadwell
on
february
when
her
future
husband
was
about
thirteen
her
father
was
referred
to
as
isham
randolph
in
shakespeare
s
walk
merchant
but
he
was
known
as
captain
for
almost
twenty
years
longer
and
not
until
the
last
decade
of
his
life
did
he
wholly
abandon
the
sea
thus
there
was
a
nautical
strain
in
the
ancestry
of
president
jefferson
which
the
critics
of
his
commercial
policy
quite
overlooked
he
himself
employed
nautical
terms
in
figures
of
speech
though
he
was
not
a
good
sailor
captain
randolph
probably
made
lengthy
sojourns
in
england
after
his
marriage
and
upon
at
least
one
important
occasion
he
acted
there
as
agent
for
his
native
province
sometime
before
the
spring
of
he
made
his
last
voyage
william
byrd
then
back
in
virginia
wrote
to
an
agent
in
england
sir
john
randolph
is
dead
and
unless
his
brother
isham
return
to
his
own
element
the
sea
i
fear
he
won
t
survive
him
many
years
captain
randolph
and
his
family
were
established
at
dungeness
before
this
time
and
had
become
acquainted
with
peter
jefferson
by
inheritance
and
grant
isham
had
become
a
large
landholder
in
goochland
in
the
year
that
peter
jefferson
became
a
magistrate
randolph
got
a
patent
for
three
thousand
acres
and
in
connection
with
it
he
certified
to
the
importation
of
forty
nine
persons
into
the
colony
two
years
later
he
entered
into
agreements
whereby
two
bond
servants
in
return
for
the
time
of
servitude
due
him
should
make
for
him
respectively
one
hundred
thousand
bricks
and
two
hundred
and
fifty
pairs
of
shoes
he
was
carrying
on
extensive
building
operations
and
supporting
a
large
establishment
in
the
year
of
his
daughter
s
marriage
he
shared
a
consignment
of
three
hundred
and
eighty
negroes
his
son
in
law
had
preceded
him
as
a
pioneer
but
had
not
been
in
a
position
to
conduct
affairs
on
such
a
scale
his
circle
of
friends
was
wider
than
that
of
the
jeffersons
to
dungeness
in
came
john
bartram
the
pennsylvania
botanist
at
the
suggestion
of
peter
collinson
who
had
became
acquainted
with
isham
in
london
the
correspondent
of
benjamin
franklin
had
recommended
to
friend
bartram
that
on
one
leg
of
his
projected
journey
to
virginia
he
stop
to
see
colonel
byrd
at
westover
and
colonel
john
custis
junior
at
williamsburg
both
curious
men
and
that
he
then
proceed
to
isham
s
place
where
he
would
receive
a
warm
welcome
of
bartram
s
comments
on
his
visit
to
dungeness
and
on
the
botanical
excursions
which
he
centered
there
the
following
would
probably
have
been
the
greatest
interest
to
jane
randolph
s
plant
loving
son
there
grows
on
the
other
side
of
the
james
river
said
bartram
to
colonel
custis
a
little
above
isham
randolph
s
a
tree
the
kind
of
which
is
known
in
europe
by
the
name
of
thuyja
or
arbor
vitae
which
if
thee
could
procure
some
seed
thereof
if
it
growed
would
be
a
curious
ornament
in
thy
garden
i
doubt
not
if
thee
was
to
write
or
speak
to
isham
he
would
procure
thee
some
his
description
of
his
host
to
collinson
as
a
generous
good
natured
gentleman
and
well
respected
by
most
who
are
acquainted
with
him
may
sound
like
faint
praise
but
at
least
it
reveals
that
isham
had
the
characteristic
social
virtues
of
his
class
this
friendly
man
afterwards
regretted
that
he
could
not
entertain
his
former
guest
by
sending
him
the
account
of
some
new
discovery
and
confessed
the
want
of
a
penetrating
genius
in
the
curious
beauties
of
nature
perhaps
he
was
unduly
modest
but
unquestionably
his
scientific
curiosity
fell
short
of
that
of
his
grandson
public
service
was
expected
of
one
with
isham
randolph
s
family
connections
and
landed
possessions
and
he
would
probably
have
been
drafted
sooner
had
he
settled
earlier
upon
the
land
about
a
year
before
his
daughter
s
marriage
he
was
elected
a
burgess
for
goochland
county
but
his
entire
legislative
career
actually
extended
to
only
a
few
weeks
his
military
service
was
more
conspicuous
in
the
same
month
that
he
was
chosen
a
burgess
he
was
appointed
adjutant
general
of
the
colony
and
he
held
this
office
until
his
death
four
years
later
he
was
expected
to
go
into
various
counties
and
give
instruction
in
the
form
of
exercise
that
had
been
prepared
for
the
soldiers
the
council
which
appointed
him
described
him
as
a
well
known
gentleman
and
universally
acceptable
in
the
country
greater
military
responsibilities
soon
fell
to
his
lot
in
the
year
a
contingent
of
virginia
troops
was
raised
to
serve
with
the
british
on
the
expedition
against
the
spanish
at
carthagena
governor
gooch
took
charge
of
these
and
left
the
colony
for
a
year
during
his
absence
isham
randolph
acted
as
chief
officer
of
the
local
militia
and
for
this
reason
it
has
sometimes
been
said
that
he
was
designated
as
lieutenant
general
of
the
colony
there
were
plenty
of
military
titles
in
thomas
jefferson
s
ancestral
record
his
maternal
grandfather
may
not
have
been
a
conspicuously
martial
figure
but
at
least
isham
was
a
link
in
a
highly
honorable
military
tradition
his
successor
as
adjutant
general
was
lawrence
washington
and
when
the
latter
died
three
years
later
the
colony
was
divided
into
districts
and
four
adjutants
were
appointed
among
these
was
lawrence
s
brother
george
it
is
difficult
to
recover
the
personality
of
a
man
from
his
portrait
or
his
epitaph
it
may
be
reported
however
that
isham
randolph
appeared
in
a
picture
frame
as
a
gentleman
in
conventional
costume
wearing
a
wig
and
with
ruffles
at
his
writs
his
full
face
implied
good
living
but
it
was
also
long
and
some
people
might
see
in
it
a
resemblance
to
thomas
jefferson
even
though
the
latter
s
nose
was
rather
more
uplifted
the
epitaph
on
his
tombstone
at
turkey
island
says
that
he
possessed
the
distinguishing
qualities
of
a
gentleman
to
an
eminent
degree
and
gives
further
testimony
to
his
good
nature
by
an
easy
compliance
and
obliging
deportment
he
knew
no
enemy
but
gained
many
friends
thus
in
his
life
meriting
an
universal
esteem
he
died
at
the
age
of
fifty
seven
in
november
three
years
after
the
marriage
of
his
daughter
to
peter
jefferson
and
only
a
few
months
before
the
birth
of
their
first
son
peter
was
older
than
the
average
when
he
married
just
as
his
father
in
law
had
been
his
wife
had
been
promised
a
dowry
of
two
hundred
pounds
sterling
but
isham
had
not
paid
it
by
the
time
he
made
his
will
jane
randolph
probably
took
a
body
servant
or
so
with
her
but
she
seems
to
have
brought
her
husband
no
land
that
was
generally
left
to
sons
if
there
were
any
the
rising
young
planter
acquired
no
fortune
by
his
marriage
but
he
gained
for
his
unborn
children
a
far
more
extensive
and
influential
family
connection
than
he
himself
had
enjoyed
it
is
likely
that
the
couple
began
their
married
life
comfortably
but
modestly
at
fine
creek
and
that
their
first
two
children
were
born
there
four
or
five
years
before
his
marriage
peter
had
staked
out
a
claim
on
the
rivanna
below
the
gap
in
the
southwest
mountains
the
date
of
his
earliest
known
grant
in
this
remote
region
was
june
when
his
future
wife
was
only
fourteen
he
may
have
made
his
surveys
before
the
leaves
fell
and
he
certainly
received
a
patent
for
one
thousand
acres
before
the
passing
of
another
summer
his
tract
extended
southward
from
secretary
s
ford
just
above
the
mountains
and
included
the
late
site
of
monticello
and
a
body
of
bottom
land
below
the
little
river
within
a
year
he
began
to
look
for
a
more
suitable
homesite
than
his
own
lands
afforded
his
friend
william
randolph
of
tuckahoe
who
had
probably
interested
him
in
this
region
in
the
first
place
had
acquired
lands
north
of
the
rivanna
which
were
still
undeveloped
peter
made
a
deal
whereby
he
acquired
two
hundred
acres
of
these
in
return
for
a
bowl
of
arrack
punch
concocted
by
henry
wetherburn
of
the
raleigh
tavern
in
williamsburg
not
until
two
years
after
his
marriage
however
did
peter
round
out
the
home
tract
he
then
acquired
two
hundred
acres
more
from
his
friend
and
made
a
cash
payment
for
the
whole
meanwhile
he
had
patented
another
small
body
of
land
south
of
the
river
it
was
probably
in
the
year
that
he
began
building
on
a
spot
whence
he
could
look
downward
at
a
stream
or
upward
toward
the
mountains
and
it
was
here
that
thomas
was
born
two
years
later
the
domain
in
this
district
to
which
the
boy
became
heir
apparent
was
modest
the
acreage
to
which
peter
had
title
was
not
extensive
by
virginia
standards
and
was
not
immediately
increased
in
that
era
of
land
grabbing
he
received
large
grants
elsewhere
but
there
is
no
certain
way
of
knowing
how
many
of
these
he
was
ever
able
to
perfect
and
on
one
occasion
the
all
powerful
council
administered
a
distinct
rebuff
by
rejecting
one
of
his
petitions
as
unreasonable
he
may
have
over
reached
himself
but
in
view
of
the
success
of
others
it
seems
more
probable
that
despite
his
connection
with
the
randolphs
he
lacked
influence
at
the
seat
of
power
on
the
whole
he
was
a
modest
speculator
in
land
in
comparison
with
his
mighty
contemporaries
in
the
province
and
even
with
certain
of
his
near
neighbors
in
the
rivanna
region
however
he
had
the
distinction
of
being
one
of
the
first
settlers
and
this
was
always
a
matter
of
pride
to
his
son
though
unexpected
events
interrupted
his
stay
peter
played
an
important
part
in
the
organization
of
a
county
which
boasts
many
distinguished
sons
but
has
been
most
glorified
by
the
name
of
jefferson
in
september
because
of
the
inconvenience
attending
the
upper
inhabitants
of
goochland
the
assembly
provided
that
after
the
last
day
of
december
the
existing
county
should
be
divided
and
a
new
one
bearing
the
euphonious
name
of
albemarle
be
formed
peter
jefferson
who
had
been
a
magistrate
in
the
old
county
attended
the
first
meeting
for
organization
in
february
and
took
oath
as
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
a
judge
of
the
court
of
chancery
thus
becoming
one
of
the
first
magistrates
and
first
gentlemen
of
the
new
one
associated
with
him
on
this
occasion
was
joshua
fry
a
former
teacher
of
mathematics
at
the
college
of
william
and
mary
who
was
now
living
on
hardware
river
near
carter
s
bridge
in
march
fry
became
county
surveyor
and
county
lieutenant
that
is
the
chief
officer
while
peter
jefferson
became
lieutenant
colonel
after
a
few
weeks
however
he
practically
ceased
attending
meetings
of
the
county
court
in
albemarle
and
he
soon
returned
to
the
goochland
side
taking
his
young
family
with
him
his
return
was
at
the
request
of
his
friend
william
randolph
now
also
referred
to
as
colonel
who
had
suffered
other
misfortunes
than
that
of
becoming
his
own
master
too
soon
he
had
married
early
and
well
but
by
the
age
of
thirty
had
become
a
widower
his
wife
was
the
daughter
of
mann
page
whose
house
at
rosewell
in
gloucester
county
is
said
to
have
contained
thirty
five
rooms
john
page
the
companion
of
thomas
jefferson
s
youth
and
young
manhood
was
her
nephew
she
had
borne
william
randolph
two
daughters
and
a
son
who
was
given
the
names
of
his
two
grandfathers
thomas
mann
randolph
was
a
couple
of
years
older
than
thomas
jefferson
who
could
say
afterwards
that
he
had
known
him
all
his
life
after
his
wife
died
william
of
tuckahoe
made
a
will
wherein
he
named
peter
as
one
of
his
executors
three
years
later
foreseeing
his
approaching
death
he
added
a
codicil
in
which
he
included
the
request
that
his
dear
and
loving
friend
should
move
down
with
his
own
family
to
the
tuckahoe
house
and
remain
there
until
randolph
s
son
was
grown
in
the
technical
sense
peter
jefferson
was
not
the
guardian
of
thomas
mann
randolph
but
the
children
remained
at
tuckahoe
with
the
jefferson
family
large
monetary
bequests
had
been
made
to
the
girls
and
the
balance
of
the
estate
was
to
go
to
the
son
as
the
resident
executor
peter
was
the
custodian
of
the
land
and
in
the
practical
sense
he
was
far
more
than
a
guardian
his
economic
status
was
considerably
more
modest
than
that
of
william
randolph
but
in
view
of
his
standing
as
magistrate
and
friend
it
seems
impossible
that
he
could
have
been
asked
to
assume
an
undignified
position
in
general
he
did
such
things
at
tuckahoe
as
the
master
himself
would
have
done
had
he
been
there
doubtless
doing
most
of
them
a
good
deal
better
it
is
surprising
however
that
he
should
have
been
willing
to
leave
his
own
lands
in
order
to
care
for
those
of
another
besides
being
an
act
of
loyal
friendship
his
move
must
have
seemed
advantageous
to
both
families
he
directed
the
activities
of
at
least
seven
overseers
at
tuckahoe
and
reported
the
production
of
far
more
tobacco
on
colonel
randolph
s
quarters
than
he
could
have
expected
from
his
own
fields
in
albemarle
his
smaller
holdings
there
were
still
largely
forested
and
he
probably
thought
it
desirable
to
leave
the
task
of
pioneering
to
an
overseer
and
his
gang
planters
often
did
that
before
moving
their
families
into
new
lands
in
the
piedmont
while
at
tuckahoe
he
could
keep
his
eye
on
his
fine
creek
property
which
lay
near
one
of
the
randolph
quarters
peter
jefferson
kept
his
accounts
methodically
as
his
son
did
afterwards
but
those
which
remain
do
not
reveal
how
much
he
received
for
his
services
to
the
estate
the
traditional
report
that
he
got
only
his
living
expenses
is
probably
correct
but
the
food
and
lodging
of
his
growing
family
constituted
a
considerable
item
and
he
was
unquestionably
a
more
prosperous
man
after
this
period
than
he
had
been
before
though
he
did
not
stay
as
long
as
william
of
tuckahoe
had
desired
he
guarded
the
land
and
the
heir
for
six
or
seven
years
altogether
thus
it
came
about
that
the
home
of
thomas
jefferson
s
earliest
remembrance
was
a
randolph
place
the
colonel
achieved
his
reputation
as
an
explorer
while
they
were
all
living
there
then
during
the
few
years
that
remained
to
him
after
their
return
to
albemarle
he
gained
greater
local
prominence
and
developed
the
estate
which
his
son
inherited
ii
the
services
of
peter
jefferson
the
earliest
recollection
of
thomas
jefferson
was
of
being
carried
on
a
pillow
by
a
mounted
slave
on
the
journey
from
shadwell
to
tuckahoe
the
circumstances
must
have
been
specially
impressive
for
he
was
only
two
or
three
years
old
at
the
time
he
had
now
ceased
to
be
the
youngest
member
of
the
family
but
he
was
still
the
only
boy
at
the
age
of
twenty
months
he
had
acquired
a
third
sister
and
a
fourth
was
born
shortly
after
he
turned
three
two
more
boys
were
born
at
tuckahoe
but
one
lived
only
a
few
weeks
and
the
other
did
not
survive
a
day
the
five
young
jeffersons
and
the
three
young
randolphs
comprised
a
good
sized
group
of
children
and
doubtless
a
lively
one
if
the
house
was
then
completed
in
its
historic
external
form
as
seems
probable
they
could
have
lived
almost
as
two
separate
families
thereby
diminishing
domestic
confusion
to
some
degree
it
had
two
distinct
wings
which
were
connected
by
a
large
room
or
salon
and
thus
it
assumed
the
shape
of
the
letter
h
one
of
the
wings
had
brick
ends
but
otherwise
it
was
a
frame
structure
painted
white
at
that
time
it
may
not
have
contained
the
fine
panelling
and
rich
stairways
which
were
seen
in
it
later
but
the
rooms
had
high
ceilings
and
were
airy
jefferson
was
there
as
a
little
boy
and
he
often
stopped
with
thomas
mann
randolph
after
he
grew
up
but
he
saw
no
reason
to
describe
such
a
familiar
house
in
letters
architecture
of
this
sort
did
not
impress
him
after
he
was
attracted
to
classic
columns
and
had
begun
to
dream
of
stateliness
but
this
home
of
his
first
memories
set
above
a
greater
stream
than
the
rivanna
always
must
have
seemed
an
exceedingly
pleasant
place
colonel
jefferson
was
directly
charged
to
carry
out
william
randolph
s
instructions
about
the
education
of
his
son
the
heir
was
not
to
be
sent
to
the
college
of
william
and
mary
or
to
england
on
any
account
whatever
but
private
tutors
were
to
be
employed
for
his
instruction
thus
the
credible
tradition
arose
that
young
tom
jefferson
first
studied
under
young
tom
randolph
s
teacher
in
a
little
house
still
standing
in
the
yard
this
part
of
his
education
he
afterwards
described
as
the
english
school
without
giving
any
details
presumably
the
tutor
taught
the
boys
and
girls
together
as
philip
fithian
did
in
the
household
of
councillor
robert
carter
at
nomini
hall
but
even
in
that
case
this
class
like
all
the
others
he
was
ever
a
member
of
was
small
in
the
absence
of
authentic
information
his
boyhood
and
schooldays
at
tuckahoe
must
be
left
to
the
imagination
it
is
said
that
once
when
desperate
with
hunger
he
fervently
repeated
the
lord
s
prayer
in
the
hope
of
hastening
a
meal
the
implication
is
clear
that
he
received
conventional
religious
instruction
but
there
is
certainly
no
suggestion
that
there
was
any
shortage
of
food
in
this
and
in
other
respects
his
father
was
a
good
provider
peter
jefferson
was
more
than
that
he
was
not
merely
providing
a
comfortable
home
for
his
family
while
doing
a
service
to
a
dead
friend
he
was
also
venturing
far
from
the
tobacco
fields
upon
occasion
and
carving
a
reputation
for
himself
out
of
the
wilderness
if
his
career
is
at
all
memorable
for
its
own
sake
and
not
solely
as
a
brief
prologue
to
one
that
was
illustrious
it
is
because
of
what
he
did
as
a
surveyor
of
boundaries
and
a
maker
of
maps
during
the
years
that
he
had
headquarters
at
tuckahoe
this
record
of
exploits
and
achievements
constituted
also
the
most
distinctive
part
of
the
heritage
that
he
transmitted
to
his
descendants
we
have
a
detailed
account
of
one
of
the
expeditions
he
went
on
his
son
was
not
yet
four
years
old
when
peter
helped
mark
what
was
known
afterwards
as
the
fairfax
line
it
is
a
pity
that
the
boy
was
not
old
enough
to
hear
the
story
of
this
hazardous
adventure
while
the
father
s
memory
of
it
was
fresh
the
colonel
was
never
much
of
a
talker
however
he
was
a
man
of
action
between
the
potomac
and
the
rappahannock
lay
the
vast
domain
of
lord
fairfax
known
as
the
northern
neck
it
was
a
part
of
the
province
of
virginia
so
far
as
government
was
concerned
but
title
to
the
soil
lay
with
the
proprietor
the
western
limits
of
this
princely
estate
were
long
the
subject
of
dispute
but
finally
by
order
of
the
privy
council
the
boundary
was
drawn
for
seventy
six
miles
between
the
headspring
of
the
rappahannock
that
is
the
source
of
the
conway
or
rapidan
across
mountain
ranges
and
primeval
wilderness
to
the
headspring
of
the
potomac
which
was
already
marked
this
was
the
fairfax
line
the
members
of
the
expedition
who
assembled
below
the
blue
ridge
in
september
comprised
some
forty
men
and
at
the
start
they
had
about
that
many
horses
there
were
commissioners
for
the
crown
and
for
lord
fairfax
the
former
including
joshua
fry
of
albemarle
county
and
there
were
surveyors
who
had
been
deputed
by
these
gentlemen
colonel
jefferson
and
robert
brooke
had
been
named
for
the
crown
captain
benjamin
winslow
and
thomas
lewis
for
the
proprietor
it
was
lewis
who
recorded
in
crude
but
graphic
language
the
story
of
the
journey
the
journey
out
from
the
head
of
the
conway
rapidan
to
the
headspring
of
the
potomac
where
they
drank
the
king
s
health
and
set
up
the
fairfax
stone
required
four
weeks
the
trip
back
to
the
starting
point
where
they
drank
healths
even
more
lustily
and
set
up
another
stone
took
three
the
preparations
had
been
elaborate
but
this
was
no
pleasure
trip
even
for
the
commissioners
who
generally
went
with
the
baggage
by
the
easiest
route
colonel
jefferson
and
the
other
surveyors
had
to
follow
the
direct
line
wherever
it
went
though
they
always
remained
mounted
as
long
as
they
could
it
took
them
over
successive
ranges
of
mountains
that
were
prodigiously
full
of
fallen
timber
and
ivey
up
and
down
precipices
where
the
horses
slipped
and
fell
and
through
swamps
of
laurel
which
appeared
impenetrable
one
dreadful
place
they
called
purgatory
and
one
stream
dismal
enough
to
strike
terror
in
any
human
creature
they
named
the
styx
several
of
the
unfortunate
horses
were
killed
and
all
of
them
nearly
starved
the
surveyors
suffered
repeated
falls
and
were
in
constant
danger
one
of
them
fainted
in
a
swamp
which
almost
became
his
tomb
colonel
jefferson
and
captain
winslow
were
older
than
the
other
two
and
they
generally
went
together
when
the
group
worked
in
pairs
for
peter
at
thirty
nine
the
expedition
was
a
feat
of
endurance
but
the
only
sign
of
weakness
he
gave
was
that
once
he
was
much
indisposed
thomas
jefferson
never
stood
on
the
top
of
the
alleghanies
where
his
father
crossed
nor
saw
the
initials
p
j
carved
on
a
beech
near
the
fairfax
stone
the
information
about
the
topography
of
his
native
region
which
he
incorporated
in
his
notes
on
virginia
was
gained
from
several
sources
but
from
his
father
he
could
have
learned
that
the
mountains
are
not
solitary
and
scattered
confusedly
over
the
face
of
the
country
but
are
disposed
in
ridges
one
behind
another
he
appears
not
to
have
referred
in
writing
to
his
father
s
connection
with
the
fairfax
line
but
undoubtedly
he
knew
of
peter
s
victories
over
the
wilderness
and
was
heartened
by
them
though
he
himself
was
an
explorer
and
a
pioneer
of
another
sort
on
november
after
the
senior
surveyor
for
the
crown
had
carved
his
initials
on
a
birch
tree
near
the
head
of
conway
he
set
out
for
home
the
other
surveyors
joined
him
at
tuckahoe
early
in
the
new
year
and
by
the
last
week
in
february
their
joint
labors
were
completed
at
a
greater
age
tom
would
have
been
deeply
interested
in
their
doings
the
map
of
the
northern
neck
that
was
sent
to
england
was
described
as
drawn
by
peter
jefferson
and
robert
brooke
for
the
region
east
of
the
blue
ridge
they
followed
the
earlier
map
of
mayo
but
they
incorporated
enough
new
material
about
the
valley
of
virginia
to
give
their
own
map
the
value
of
a
source
record
needless
to
say
this
map
showed
for
the
first
time
the
fairfax
line
the
name
of
joshua
fry
is
linked
with
that
of
peter
jefferson
in
the
most
important
of
the
latter
s
activities
as
a
surveyor
in
effect
if
not
in
fact
the
two
men
constituted
a
partnership
somewhat
more
than
three
years
after
they
helped
set
up
the
fairfax
stone
they
surveyed
the
dividing
line
between
virginia
and
north
carolina
for
ninety
miles
beyond
the
point
where
william
byrd
and
his
fellow
commissioners
had
left
it
a
score
of
years
before
unfortunately
no
chronicler
was
present
to
record
their
exploits
and
except
for
his
plan
such
documents
as
the
junior
surveyor
left
appear
to
have
been
destroyed
the
byrd
party
had
carried
the
line
to
peter
s
creek
in
the
fall
of
colonel
fry
and
colonel
jefferson
extended
it
to
steep
rock
creek
in
what
is
now
washington
county
the
plan
itself
shows
that
they
crossed
new
river
and
many
small
streams
and
several
ranges
of
mountains
the
hardships
and
perils
that
they
met
must
have
been
talked
about
in
tom
s
presence
for
they
became
a
tradition
in
his
family
years
later
his
grandchildren
repeated
stories
which
must
have
come
through
him
that
these
men
had
to
defend
themselves
against
wild
beasts
by
day
and
to
sleep
in
the
trees
at
night
that
their
provisions
ran
low
and
they
had
to
live
on
raw
flesh
that
peter
s
courage
did
not
fail
when
his
companions
fainted
from
exhaustion
beside
him
he
and
fry
went
further
than
they
had
gone
when
drawing
the
fairfax
line
and
both
of
them
were
now
older
for
their
extraordinary
trouble
and
painful
service
however
they
did
not
go
unrewarded
before
the
end
of
the
year
they
reported
their
proceedings
to
the
council
produced
an
account
of
their
expenses
and
presented
their
maps
then
the
members
of
that
body
unanimously
agreed
that
each
of
them
was
deserving
of
three
hundred
pounds
sterling
beyond
all
expenses
nor
were
their
abilities
forgotten
some
months
later
the
acting
governor
following
a
directive
from
the
lords
of
trade
selected
them
as
the
best
qualified
persons
to
draw
a
map
of
the
inhabited
part
of
virginia
in
october
the
honorable
lewis
burwell
whose
daughter
was
wooed
unsuccessfully
by
the
son
of
peter
jefferson
asked
the
opinion
of
the
council
in
regard
to
their
compensation
each
was
thought
deserving
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
sterling
for
his
expense
and
trouble
their
map
was
done
by
that
time
and
unlike
the
original
materials
on
which
it
was
based
it
has
withstood
the
ravages
of
fire
and
time
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
was
printed
it
appeared
in
london
in
and
a
second
edition
containing
improvements
by
john
dalrymple
chiefly
in
the
form
of
wagon
roads
was
issued
four
years
later
this
second
map
was
reproduced
in
successive
atlases
and
its
superiority
to
all
others
up
to
the
time
that
thomas
jefferson
compiled
his
notes
on
virginia
was
generally
recognized
for
geographical
knowledge
of
his
native
country
therefore
he
and
his
contemporaries
were
deeply
indebted
to
his
father
john
henry
father
of
patrick
published
a
map
in
but
this
was
not
based
on
original
surveys
and
it
has
generally
been
regarded
as
an
inaccurate
compilation
jefferson
subscribed
for
it
but
he
probably
had
no
more
respect
for
it
than
he
had
for
the
legal
training
of
john
henry
s
son
soon
after
his
map
was
published
peter
returned
to
shadwell
from
tuckahoe
his
record
of
the
tobacco
crops
on
colonel
randolph
s
quarters
ends
with
thenceforth
he
farmed
his
own
lands
and
rounded
out
his
own
estate
he
drew
no
more
major
boundary
lines
but
he
was
county
surveyor
in
goochland
that
year
he
was
again
a
magistrate
of
albemarle
by
the
following
spring
and
a
couple
of
years
after
that
he
became
county
surveyor
there
in
succession
to
joshua
fry
who
had
just
died
at
fort
cumberland
while
commanding
the
virginia
forces
on
the
frontier
george
washington
was
his
lieutenant
fry
has
been
credited
with
being
the
chief
constructive
influence
in
the
life
of
peter
jefferson
and
not
improperly
his
good
will
continued
to
manifest
itself
after
he
was
dead
he
named
his
associate
an
executor
of
his
will
left
him
the
surveying
instruments
which
they
had
used
together
and
in
effect
bequeathed
him
his
major
public
offices
colonel
jefferson
had
been
made
the
second
military
officer
of
albemarle
when
the
county
was
formed
he
now
succeeded
fry
as
county
lieutenant
and
also
as
a
member
of
the
house
of
burgesses
he
served
during
two
sessions
of
the
assembly
in
and
but
presumably
he
did
not
stand
for
re
election
his
legislative
career
was
approximately
as
brief
and
unimportant
as
that
of
his
father
in
law
isham
randolph
but
his
service
as
county
lieutenant
appears
to
have
lasted
until
the
end
of
his
life
he
did
nothing
in
particular
in
the
french
and
indian
war
but
he
was
the
chief
officer
and
the
first
citizen
of
the
county
during
much
of
this
time
tom
was
away
from
home
at
school
in
goochland
but
when
the
boy
returned
to
look
at
the
mountains
and
flourish
in
the
sunshine
of
albemarle
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
his
established
position
in
the
community
tom
was
about
nine
years
old
when
the
family
moved
back
to
shadwell
not
until
after
his
father
s
death
five
years
later
did
he
observe
the
full
procession
of
the
seasons
in
albemarle
but
he
was
here
during
vacations
at
least
and
henceforth
this
place
was
home
it
provided
the
domestic
background
of
his
life
until
he
was
twenty
seven
no
mansion
ever
stood
on
this
homesite
but
his
father
erected
a
substantial
group
of
plantation
buildings
before
he
died
he
either
enlarged
the
little
house
in
which
the
boy
had
been
born
or
built
another
wooden
structure
for
the
central
unit
and
he
added
a
dairy
smoke
house
and
other
outbuildings
of
the
sort
until
he
had
a
frontage
of
more
than
two
hundred
feet
above
the
river
to
the
southward
the
land
sloped
for
several
hundred
yards
to
the
rivanna
where
he
had
a
water
mill
this
occupied
a
good
deal
of
his
son
s
attention
later
on
the
three
notched
road
passed
the
place
on
the
north
much
as
the
highway
does
today
and
proceeding
westward
through
the
gap
crossed
the
stream
at
the
secretary
s
ford
the
ridge
of
the
southwest
mountains
which
is
broken
at
this
gap
enters
the
present
county
in
the
extreme
northeast
and
there
it
reaches
its
greatest
height
fifteen
hundred
feet
in
a
knob
which
came
to
be
called
peter
s
mountain
for
colonel
jefferson
as
his
son
said
all
the
virginia
mountains
run
in
the
same
direction
from
northeast
to
southwest
but
these
being
the
first
discovered
appropriated
the
latter
name
to
themselves
the
range
roughly
parallels
the
blue
ridge
about
twenty
miles
away
on
its
slopes
tom
hunted
and
beneath
them
many
of
the
first
plantation
houses
nestled
there
may
have
been
better
sites
on
the
western
side
whence
the
eye
could
command
the
blue
ridge
but
settlers
had
been
attracted
first
to
the
eastern
which
faced
the
sunrise
properties
ran
in
generous
strips
from
the
wooded
summits
to
the
lowlands
the
largest
of
these
dated
back
to
a
grant
of
more
than
thirteen
thousand
acres
to
nicholas
meriwether
which
was
referred
to
as
the
grant
because
it
was
so
early
and
so
huge
this
included
the
site
of
castle
hill
some
eight
miles
from
shadwell
though
no
plantation
house
had
been
erected
there
as
yet
a
considerable
part
of
this
lordly
estate
eventually
came
into
the
possession
of
dr
thomas
walker
wherever
he
may
have
been
living
when
the
jeffersons
came
back
he
soon
served
peter
as
a
friend
and
his
son
john
afterwards
became
intimate
with
tom
closer
at
hand
was
john
harvie
who
had
bought
lands
adjoining
the
william
randolph
property
it
is
uncertain
just
when
he
built
belmont
but
from
an
early
time
he
was
a
near
neighbor
as
nearness
was
understood
in
albemarle
the
shadwell
tract
proper
consisted
of
only
four
hundred
acres
but
colonel
jefferson
soon
purchased
the
place
on
the
same
side
of
the
river
that
was
later
known
as
pantops
his
son
always
liked
this
because
of
its
magnificent
view
south
of
the
river
peter
s
lands
stretched
toward
carter
s
mountain
and
included
not
only
the
site
of
monticello
but
also
a
small
tract
which
he
had
patented
in
and
which
was
known
as
partibello
to
this
he
now
added
another
of
the
same
size
called
tufton
he
also
patented
a
body
of
woodland
which
is
identified
on
thomas
jefferson
s
land
roll
as
pouncey
s
approximately
two
thousand
six
hundred
and
fifty
acres
that
the
latter
afterwards
held
in
this
part
of
the
county
were
acquired
by
his
father
peter
jefferson
was
also
increasing
his
holdings
and
developing
his
lands
in
another
part
of
albermarle
three
more
children
joined
the
family
after
the
removal
from
tuckahoe
including
the
twins
one
of
whom
was
a
boy
named
randolph
peter
built
up
for
his
sons
two
estates
of
practically
the
same
size
one
centering
at
shadwell
and
the
other
on
the
south
fork
of
the
james
sometimes
called
the
fluvanna
soon
after
the
county
was
formed
the
assembly
had
empowered
him
joshua
fry
and
others
to
expend
one
hundred
pounds
in
clearing
the
latter
stream
of
rocks
which
in
several
places
obstructed
navigation
it
was
broader
there
than
the
north
branch
or
rivanna
and
unlike
it
served
an
important
function
in
starting
the
money
crop
on
the
way
to
market
while
the
jeffersons
were
still
at
tuckahoe
there
had
been
a
notable
advance
in
the
use
of
canoes
above
the
fall
line
this
was
owing
to
the
ingenuity
of
the
reverend
robert
rose
a
large
planter
who
lashed
two
of
these
tottering
vehicles
together
and
thus
enabled
them
to
carry
eight
or
nine
hogsheads
of
tobacco
at
a
time
without
tipping
peter
s
tobacco
from
the
rivanna
district
had
to
go
by
land
either
by
wagon
or
by
the
crude
method
of
rolling
in
specially
constructed
hogsheads
but
he
was
able
to
employ
water
transportation
on
the
fluvanna
his
main
place
there
he
named
snowdon
after
the
mountains
in
wales
near
the
reputed
home
of
his
ancestors
in
his
lifetime
the
fluvanna
district
was
the
more
important
part
of
the
county
the
courthouse
was
there
near
the
present
town
of
scottsville
he
was
one
of
the
persons
who
had
determined
the
location
and
he
owned
houses
at
the
ferry
crossing
which
he
leased
to
the
keeper
of
an
ordinary
this
was
about
twenty
five
miles
from
shadwell
not
until
the
region
below
the
fluvanna
had
been
separated
from
albemarle
after
thomas
jefferson
went
to
college
was
the
town
of
charlottesville
established
by
law
and
the
courthouse
located
there
it
was
built
on
its
present
site
about
four
miles
west
of
shadwell
this
was
too
late
to
do
peter
jefferson
any
good
but
it
was
a
convenience
to
his
son
as
a
practising
lawyer
even
during
the
revolution
the
county
seat
contained
little
besides
a
courthouse
a
tavern
and
a
dozen
houses
a
traveler
then
observed
that
the
region
when
viewed
from
one
of
its
many
eminences
appeared
as
a
vast
forest
interspersed
with
plantations
four
or
five
miles
apart
and
resembling
small
villages
this
was
no
land
of
bustling
towns
nor
predominantly
of
small
farms
as
a
rule
holdings
were
larger
than
in
the
shenandoah
valley
though
smaller
than
in
tidewater
when
peter
jefferson
knew
the
region
and
his
son
was
a
boy
this
was
a
silent
country
of
far
flung
patriarchal
seats
though
these
were
without
architectural
pretension
afterwards
plain
farmhouses
on
smaller
clearings
increased
in
number
in
the
bottoms
and
on
the
lower
slopes
the
red
soil
was
rich
in
its
virginal
state
before
it
was
exhausted
by
tobacco
or
ravaged
by
erosion
the
temperate
climate
was
favorable
to
virginia
s
historic
crop
and
also
to
the
fruit
trees
and
grains
which
peter
jefferson
s
son
afterwards
encouraged
while
the
dogwood
the
redbud
and
the
shadbush
made
this
a
sylvan
paradise
in
spring
by
all
prevailing
standards
the
district
was
healthful
the
inhabitants
often
spoke
of
themselves
as
mountaineers
and
congratulated
themselves
on
their
freedom
from
agues
and
fevers
before
thomas
jefferson
was
grown
one
of
them
said
the
descent
of
our
lands
is
so
