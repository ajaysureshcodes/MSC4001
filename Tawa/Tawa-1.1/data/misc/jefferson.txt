jefferson
the
virginian
by
dumas
malone
i
jeffersons
and
randolphs
thomas
jefferson
was
born
in
a
simple
wooden
house
in
what
is
now
albermarle
county
virginia
at
that
time
the
district
was
in
the
county
of
goochland
and
virginia
was
a
province
of
king
george
ii
of
great
britain
by
the
calendar
then
in
effect
the
birthday
was
april
but
according
to
the
new
style
which
was
adopted
when
jefferson
was
still
a
boy
it
was
april
and
thus
it
has
been
celebrated
through
the
years
this
was
a
delicious
season
for
the
air
of
the
virginia
piedmont
is
soft
in
april
the
dogwood
soon
opens
in
the
woods
and
the
wild
honeysuckle
begins
to
bloom
the
house
has
long
since
vanished
but
the
site
is
marked
and
anybody
who
goes
there
now
can
see
that
it
was
well
chosen
to
the
southward
it
overlooks
the
rivanna
river
often
referred
to
then
as
the
north
river
or
north
branch
of
the
james
this
is
now
a
muddy
and
unimpressive
stream
but
it
once
was
purer
the
prospect
to
the
west
is
finer
for
on
any
clear
day
the
distant
blue
ridge
can
be
seen
through
a
gap
in
the
southwest
mountains
the
place
was
called
shadwell
peter
jefferson
who
owned
it
had
named
if
for
the
parish
in
london
where
his
wife
jane
randolph
had
been
christened
twenty
three
years
before
the
setting
did
not
suggest
the
thames
basin
or
hanoverian
england
however
this
was
not
a
rainy
but
generally
a
sunny
land
and
it
had
no
antiquity
or
mellowness
for
as
a
seat
of
settlement
it
was
almost
wholly
new
the
hardwood
forests
which
covered
the
bottom
lands
and
steep
hillsides
were
broken
by
only
a
few
clearings
where
the
red
soil
glowed
and
the
first
wails
of
this
newborn
infant
could
have
been
echoed
by
the
howling
of
the
wolves
the
earliest
surroundings
of
this
natural
philosopher
were
beautiful
but
they
were
wild
jefferson
was
born
on
the
fringe
of
western
settlement
and
some
will
say
that
he
thus
became
a
child
of
the
american
frontier
no
influence
upon
him
was
more
abiding
than
that
of
nature
and
throughout
life
he
deeply
loved
this
region
of
wooded
hills
and
lavender
tinted
mountains
but
shadwell
was
not
the
home
of
his
earliest
memories
when
he
was
two
or
three
years
old
he
was
taken
from
it
to
tuckahoe
on
the
james
to
an
older
and
better
house
in
a
more
thickly
settled
district
at
that
time
no
parts
of
virginia
were
thickly
settled
with
a
few
exceptions
the
entire
province
was
a
vast
forest
tobacco
plantations
and
their
seats
were
strung
loosely
along
the
rivers
but
to
all
european
observers
the
clearings
seemed
small
and
the
country
looked
uninhabited
the
vastness
of
this
physical
setting
was
not
lost
upon
thomas
jefferson
it
was
reflected
in
the
largeness
of
the
mind
furthermore
this
society
as
a
whole
was
closer
to
the
frontier
than
later
generations
might
at
first
realize
but
jefferson
was
in
albemarle
only
intermittently
during
his
boyhood
and
he
knew
the
region
best
after
the
fringe
of
settlement
stretched
well
beyond
it
he
as
used
to
sparsely
settled
country
but
he
did
not
know
the
frontier
by
experience
and
though
he
was
always
aware
of
the
wilderness
he
was
not
in
the
physical
sense
an
explorer
peter
jefferson
a
man
of
huge
stature
and
legendary
strength
was
in
his
mid
thirties
in
he
performed
memorable
deeds
as
a
surveyor
in
uncharted
country
in
later
years
but
at
no
time
was
he
a
typical
frontiersman
he
was
not
yet
at
the
height
of
his
fortunes
though
he
was
a
slaveowner
and
he
had
other
lands
below
the
james
thirty
miles
or
so
to
the
southeast
where
he
had
previously
lived
he
was
no
landless
pioneer
but
an
enterprising
young
planter
who
may
have
ventured
a
bit
too
far
to
the
westward
in
this
instance
he
had
been
there
several
years
however
he
had
intended
to
stay
and
he
may
already
have
planned
the
extensive
group
of
plantation
buildings
he
eventually
erected
he
built
only
a
modest
unit
at
first
and
it
was
to
this
plain
house
that
he
had
brought
his
wife
and
two
little
daughters
the
year
before
his
third
child
and
first
son
was
born
jane
randolph
may
not
have
liked
the
extreme
remoteness
of
shadwell
and
probably
was
glad
that
her
first
stay
there
was
short
the
most
important
early
fact
about
thomas
jefferson
is
not
that
he
appeared
on
the
edge
of
settlement
but
that
he
was
born
in
the
province
of
virginia
and
that
from
his
first
days
he
was
numbered
among
its
gentry
he
was
not
born
to
physical
hardship
as
abraham
lincoln
was
he
did
not
know
town
life
from
boyhood
as
benjamin
franklin
did
in
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term
he
was
no
self
made
man
he
grew
up
in
the
generous
society
which
had
been
created
in
a
new
country
and
a
warm
climate
by
a
group
of
planters
cultivating
tobacco
and
relying
on
slave
labor
from
his
earliest
memories
his
financial
position
was
assured
and
the
best
educational
opportunities
which
the
colony
afforded
were
later
available
to
him
he
gave
chief
thanks
to
his
father
for
all
this
and
he
himself
would
have
made
peter
jefferson
the
dominant
character
in
his
early
history
but
this
plantation
society
centered
in
families
and
thomas
jefferson
s
history
necessarily
begins
as
a
story
of
a
family
or
rather
of
two
families
and
how
they
merged
jefferson
s
connections
stood
him
in
good
stead
while
he
was
growing
up
and
he
always
valued
them
on
personal
grounds
but
he
never
spent
much
of
his
previous
time
on
the
remote
subject
of
genealogy
as
a
young
man
he
was
not
wholly
indifferent
to
his
ancestry
but
in
the
ripeness
of
age
he
made
light
of
it
and
there
are
a
number
of
people
now
living
who
know
more
about
it
than
he
did
to
him
the
degree
of
their
interest
would
seem
surprising
for
he
was
more
interested
in
the
origins
of
laws
and
institutions
than
in
the
beginnings
of
any
particular
family
and
he
belonged
to
the
school
of
thought
which
magnified
the
influence
of
environment
and
minimized
heredity
too
much
probably
the
progenitor
in
whom
he
took
greatest
pride
was
his
father
and
this
because
of
what
peter
jefferson
did
rather
than
what
he
inherited
his
father
was
a
man
of
deeds
not
words
but
there
is
indication
that
this
inarticulate
squire
set
considerable
store
by
family
traditions
the
naming
of
shadwell
showed
that
although
jane
randolph
may
have
made
the
original
suggestion
furthermore
he
afterwards
had
a
place
on
the
fluvanna
river
which
he
called
snowdon
after
a
mountain
in
wales
near
which
the
jeffersons
were
supposed
once
to
have
lived
whether
they
ever
did
seems
to
be
beyond
the
possibility
of
historical
verification
and
the
matter
is
of
no
real
importance
if
they
were
originally
welsh
they
had
become
predominantly
english
after
they
had
lived
for
several
generations
in
virginia
thomas
jefferson
s
own
knowledge
of
his
paternal
ancestry
went
back
only
to
his
grandfather
after
whom
he
was
named
the
line
can
be
traced
with
certainty
only
one
step
further
to
an
obscure
man
whom
we
shall
call
thomas
jefferson
i
for
the
purposes
of
this
story
he
was
a
farmer
naturally
enough
and
by
the
year
he
was
living
in
henrico
county
which
was
then
much
larger
than
it
now
is
considerably
below
the
present
location
of
richmond
he
was
in
the
curls
region
so
called
because
of
the
eccentricities
of
the
james
river
which
in
one
stretch
of
six
miles
managed
to
meaner
through
sixteen
this
was
in
the
low
and
level
tidewater
country
overspread
with
heavy
forests
and
flowering
shrubs
where
practically
all
of
the
virginians
then
were
as
far
to
the
west
as
settlers
dared
go
lived
an
exceedingly
enterprising
man
named
william
byrd
from
the
falls
of
the
james
he
dispatched
traders
into
the
carolinas
to
barter
with
the
indians
in
thomas
jefferson
i
who
himself
had
moved
further
westward
had
a
small
business
transaction
with
this
magnate
he
bought
from
him
a
parcel
of
land
consisting
of
about
one
hundred
and
sixty
seven
acres
technically
he
was
then
a
squatter
on
this
very
piece
of
property
though
the
presumption
is
that
nobody
thought
his
conduct
at
all
reprehensible
the
governor
finding
that
the
land
had
escheated
to
the
king
had
granted
it
to
another
who
had
assigned
it
to
the
acquisitive
byrd
and
the
latter
at
length
sold
it
to
the
occupant
for
a
valuable
consideration
the
real
moral
of
the
tale
is
that
neither
in
financial
power
nor
worldly
wisdom
were
the
early
jeffersons
a
match
for
the
early
byrds
on
the
other
hand
this
ancestor
of
a
president
must
have
had
some
capital
and
apparently
he
was
not
the
sort
of
farmer
who
could
be
easily
evicted
by
a
richer
man
presumably
this
was
the
place
where
his
son
lived
afterwards
if
so
it
was
on
the
south
bank
of
the
river
some
twenty
miles
below
the
falls
and
strategically
situated
for
a
landing
at
this
time
there
were
land
barons
in
virginia
to
whom
such
holdings
seemed
small
and
such
a
man
inconsequential
but
the
heyday
of
the
plantation
aristocracy
had
not
yet
arrived
though
the
economic
and
social
structure
of
the
colony
was
taking
form
it
had
not
attained
rigidity
life
was
dispersed
and
fluid
in
this
spacious
country
and
here
for
many
years
yet
vigorous
and
ambitious
men
had
an
excellent
chance
to
rise
this
was
an
unequal
society
in
an
age
of
recognized
inequality
but
except
for
the
lowest
group
the
slaves
it
was
not
one
of
rigid
caste
the
road
to
riches
and
power
lay
open
to
those
who
acquired
land
while
it
was
still
easy
to
get
and
who
somehow
found
labor
with
which
to
exploit
it
the
distinct
advantage
lay
with
those
who
had
influence
and
capital
labor
was
always
scarcer
than
land
and
slaves
rather
than
acreage
came
to
be
the
major
criterion
of
prosperity
but
no
one
had
many
slaves
or
much
ready
money
in
the
late
seventeenth
century
and
the
status
of
a
small
landowner
who
tilled
a
virgin
soil
was
far
from
degraded
his
life
was
undoubtedly
crude
but
nature
was
prodigal
and
the
future
beckoned
the
first
thomas
jefferson
probably
had
little
capital
or
influence
but
he
went
forward
on
the
road
to
fortune
and
a
genteel
station
besides
bearing
and
transmitting
a
good
name
he
increased
his
holdings
and
became
a
man
of
respectable
estate
he
acquired
no
military
title
but
judging
from
the
number
of
wolf
bounties
he
collected
he
had
some
prowess
as
a
hunter
he
became
one
of
ye
surveyours
of
ye
highways
thus
establishing
a
tradition
in
the
family
he
frequently
did
jury
duty
and
as
a
man
of
recognized
integrity
he
served
several
times
as
an
executor
of
wills
his
wife
mary
branch
brought
him
some
property
and
when
he
dies
in
he
had
several
slaves
besides
his
widow
mary
he
left
a
son
thomas
and
a
daughter
martha
these
three
names
kept
reappearing
in
the
family
with
unfailing
regularity
they
were
all
present
at
monticello
it
would
be
easy
to
make
too
much
of
the
fact
that
mary
branch
jefferson
three
years
after
she
became
a
widow
married
a
man
who
could
sign
the
wedding
contract
only
by
making
his
mark
for
her
second
husband
joseph
mattocks
had
property
and
she
herself
could
write
her
name
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
however
that
either
she
or
her
first
husband
was
a
cultivated
person
probably
there
was
no
time
in
the
history
of
this
province
when
it
was
more
difficult
to
become
one
before
the
establishment
of
the
college
of
william
and
mary
practically
the
only
educational
opportunities
were
those
that
england
provided
a
few
of
the
very
rich
the
result
was
a
generation
of
men
who
if
they
had
the
good
fortune
to
read
and
write
had
no
further
commerce
with
the
muses
or
learned
sciences
but
spent
their
life
ignobly
at
the
hoe
and
spade
and
other
employments
of
an
uncultivated
and
unpolished
country
not
until
the
greatest
of
the
name
appeared
did
any
of
the
jeffersons
have
much
learning
but
the
lack
of
it
was
too
general
at
this
time
to
constitute
an
insuperable
bar
to
admission
into
the
lesser
gentry
whether
or
not
the
first
thomas
jefferson
should
be
called
a
yeoman
is
a
question
of
definition
and
a
matter
of
no
real
consequence
the
second
of
the
name
as
officially
a
gentleman
before
the
end
of
the
century
thomas
ii
owned
a
racing
mare
and
racing
was
generally
a
prerogative
of
the
gentry
more
significant
than
this
is
the
fact
that
he
became
one
of
the
gentleman
justices
of
henrico
county
before
he
was
thirty
and
that
he
continued
to
be
one
for
almost
twenty
years
among
his
honorable
associates
were
the
second
william
randolph
and
an
early
francis
eppes
these
highly
reputable
names
reappear
in
the
story
of
his
descendants
besides
being
a
local
magistrate
he
was
a
captain
of
the
militia
the
officers
generally
dined
together
after
muster
and
upon
one
of
these
occasions
colonel
william
byrd
second
of
the
name
and
the
elegant
master
of
westover
ate
roast
beef
at
jefferson
s
house
for
at
least
two
years
the
captain
held
the
important
post
of
sheriff
at
henrico
as
a
justice
might
have
been
expected
to
do
and
he
was
once
recompensed
for
extraordinary
services
he
is
said
to
have
built
a
church
in
bristol
parish
which
was
called
jefferson
s
church
for
half
a
century
there
is
no
clue
to
his
personality
but
he
must
have
been
vigorous
and
there
can
be
no
question
of
his
official
standing
or
sense
of
public
responsibility
in
this
society
the
two
were
inseparable
soon
after
his
father
s
death
and
shortly
before
he
attained
his
majority
he
married
mary
field
daughter
of
major
peter
field
of
new
kent
county
and
his
wife
judith
who
was
the
widow
of
henry
randolph
and
the
daughter
of
a
former
speaker
of
the
house
of
burgesses
from
both
the
financial
and
social
point
of
view
this
was
an
advantageous
alliance
he
received
grants
of
land
on
several
occasions
for
the
importation
of
persons
into
the
colony
and
he
engaged
in
numerous
land
transactions
after
the
manner
of
the
enterprising
planters
of
his
day
though
not
on
the
vast
scale
of
the
byrds
the
randolphs
and
the
carters
the
grant
of
fifteen
hundred
acres
on
fine
creek
south
of
the
james
and
well
above
the
falls
which
was
made
to
him
and
three
others
by
governor
spotswood
in
anticipated
the
westward
movement
in
which
his
son
took
part
he
himself
had
his
house
at
what
was
repeatedly
referred
to
as
jefferson
s
landing
later
described
as
osborne
s
here
on
the
last
day
of
february
his
son
peter
was
born
there
were
three
children
already
judith
thomas
and
field
and
later
there
were
two
more
daughters
bearing
the
inevitable
names
mary
and
martha
when
peter
was
eight
he
lost
his
mother
and
his
father
appears
to
have
remarried
later
though
the
captain
was
again
a
widower
when
he
died
long
years
afterward
writing
his
autobiography
at
monticello
thomas
jefferson
said
that
his
father
s
mind
was
naturally
strong
but
that
his
education
had
been
neglected
in
comparison
with
thomas
s
superior
opportunities
peter
s
was
unquestionably
limited
as
were
those
of
so
many
others
in
that
dispersed
society
he
did
not
grow
up
in
such
ignorance
as
to
be
seriously
handicapped
in
practical
affairs
but
the
accident
of
his
position
within
the
family
may
have
caused
him
to
be
relatively
neglected
he
lost
his
mother
while
he
was
still
a
child
and
as
the
youngest
of
three
sons
he
had
only
modest
expectations
in
his
youth
attention
was
probably
centered
in
the
heir
apparent
the
third
thomas
who
was
born
in
and
dies
twenty
three
years
later
on
a
ship
commanded
by
captain
isham
randolph
peter
jefferson
himself
afterwards
married
this
captain
randolph
s
daughter
though
there
can
be
no
question
of
the
honorable
standing
of
peter
s
father
the
second
thomas
jefferson
there
is
considerable
doubt
about
the
degree
of
his
prosperity
in
the
last
decade
of
his
life
he
suffered
a
heavy
loss
from
fire
which
occasioned
him
to
petition
the
house
of
burgesses
for
relief
and
a
few
years
later
when
he
failed
to
context
a
suit
against
him
for
of
tobacco
the
court
ordered
an
attachment
of
his
property
sufficient
to
satisfy
his
debt
the
will
which
he
drew
six
years
before
his
death
in
and
the
inventory
which
ultimately
went
with
it
show
that
he
had
considerably
more
household
goods
livestock
and
servants
than
thomas
jefferson
i
had
had
but
they
leave
many
unanswered
questions
about
his
land
neither
peter
nor
his
elder
brother
field
lived
on
the
ancestral
acres
after
their
father
died
as
a
justice
of
the
peace
in
lunenburg
field
maintained
the
connection
of
the
family
with
the
county
gentry
peter
who
was
named
his
father
s
executor
got
the
holdings
on
fine
and
manikin
creeks
in
goochland
county
and
if
he
did
not
already
live
on
them
he
soon
began
to
his
inheritance
of
land
was
probably
fair
sized
though
certainly
not
princely
besides
this
he
received
the
bulk
of
his
father
s
personal
possessions
including
half
of
the
livestock
a
couple
of
horses
and
two
slaves
presumably
body
servants
to
a
modest
extent
he
was
a
slaveowner
and
by
birth
and
association
he
was
a
member
of
the
country
gentry
he
cannot
be
described
as
a
completely
self
made
man
but
the
enhancement
of
his
fortunes
like
the
improvement
of
his
mind
must
be
chiefly
attributed
to
his
own
exertions
soon
after
he
presented
his
father
s
will
and
had
it
approved
in
the
county
court
he
removed
or
returned
to
fine
creek
he
was
then
about
twenty
five
years
old
and
at
the
peak
of
his
great
physical
strength
the
county
of
goochland
to
which
he
went
had
recently
been
set
off
from
henrico
it
lay
above
the
fall
line
and
straddled
the
james
peter
s
place
was
on
a
minor
tributary
to
the
south
of
the
river
here
he
lived
some
ten
years
until
about
developing
his
plantation
acquiring
claims
and
titles
elsewhere
and
gaining
for
himself
a
recognized
standing
in
the
district
the
date
of
his
definite
establishment
as
a
local
leader
was
when
he
followed
in
his
father
s
footsteps
by
becoming
a
justice
of
the
peace
three
years
later
when
he
was
thirty
he
became
sheriff
later
still
after
he
had
wandered
far
and
gained
laurels
elsewhere
he
was
county
surveyor
when
peter
first
came
to
goochland
the
strategic
post
of
surveyor
was
held
by
one
of
his
near
neighbors
william
mayo
probably
the
foremost
virginia
surveyor
of
his
time
mayo
helped
run
the
dividing
line
between
virginia
and
north
carolina
immortalized
by
the
second
william
byrd
peter
jefferson
who
afterwards
helped
extend
this
dividing
line
appears
to
have
accompanied
his
neighbor
on
some
of
his
later
trips
and
from
him
he
probably
acquired
the
elements
of
surveying
such
knowledge
was
immensely
useful
to
any
planter
and
it
played
an
important
part
in
peter
s
successful
career
as
it
did
in
that
of
george
washington
he
engaged
in
surveying
throughout
the
rest
of
his
life
and
by
means
of
it
won
for
himself
an
honorable
if
minor
place
in
the
history
of
american
exploration
on
the
other
side
of
the
james
from
fine
creek
and
fifteen
miles
or
more
to
the
eastward
was
tuckahoe
the
house
had
been
built
by
thomas
randolph
now
dead
who
had
been
the
foremost
citizen
of
the
new
county
he
as
one
of
the
seven
sons
of
william
randolph
of
turkey
island
and
is
generally
known
as
thomas
of
tuckahoe
the
custom
of
designating
individuals
by
their
plantation
seals
arose
naturally
in
a
society
which
made
a
practice
of
repeating
christian
names
from
generation
to
generation
and
it
has
proved
a
boon
to
confused
antiquarians
ever
since
it
became
a
virtual
necessity
among
the
innumerable
randolphs
no
inappropriately
have
william
of
turkey
island
and
his
wife
mary
isham
been
termed
the
adam
and
eve
of
virginia
bearers
of
the
randolph
name
sprouted
like
so
many
pine
trees
in
an
abandoned
field
and
many
of
them
became
monarchs
of
the
forest
if
descendants
through
maternal
lines
are
counted
the
long
roll
of
this
remarkable
clan
falls
little
short
of
comprising
the
entire
body
of
the
gentry
it
includes
the
names
of
thomas
jefferson
john
marshall
and
robert
e
lee
and
if
viewed
comprehensively
it
defies
comparison
with
any
other
american
family
peter
jefferson
s
first
close
contact
with
the
randolphs
came
through
the
young
master
of
tuckahoe
the
son
of
thomas
who
was
names
william
like
his
grandfather
and
one
of
his
uncles
thus
adding
to
the
genealogical
confusion
according
to
the
second
william
byrd
this
william
randolph
was
a
pretty
young
man
who
had
the
misfortune
to
become
his
own
master
too
soon
perhaps
he
was
not
sufficiently
deferential
to
the
colonel
that
urbane
gentleman
remarked
that
he
had
a
strange
conceit
of
his
won
sufficiency
which
was
accentuated
by
a
small
smattering
of
learning
william
of
tuckahoe
was
five
or
six
years
younger
than
peter
jefferson
who
by
all
accounts
was
modest
the
friendship
of
these
county
neighbors
may
have
been
a
case
of
the
attraction
of
opposites
or
merely
the
result
of
propinquity
in
a
fluid
and
friendly
society
the
two
young
men
became
magistrates
in
the
same
year
and
their
names
were
linked
from
that
time
forward
they
were
intimate
for
more
than
a
decade
and
almost
a
half
century
later
their
lines
were
joined
by
the
marriage
of
their
grandchildren
there
was
instability
in
this
branch
of
the
randolphs
and
beginning
with
peter
the
jeffersons
served
to
offset
it
on
the
same
side
of
the
river
as
tuckahoe
and
somewhat
west
of
fine
creek
was
a
place
called
dungeness
belonging
to
isham
randolph
uncle
of
young
william
the
eldest
of
the
many
children
there
was
a
girl
named
jane
she
was
nineteen
and
peter
jefferson
was
thirty
two
when
he
married
her
in
october
perhaps
the
courtship
began
a
couple
of
years
earlier
for
her
father
and
william
of
tuckahoe
had
shared
peter
s
bond
for
one
thousand
pounds
sterling
when
he
became
sheriff
isham
probably
knew
and
trusted
him
even
before
that
but
he
himself
had
not
yet
settled
down
at
dungeness
when
peter
first
came
to
goochland
isham
s
daughter
had
been
born
in
england
and
he
was
no
man
of
the
back
country
he
had
had
greater
opportunities
and
a
more
colorful
life
than
peter
s
father
isham
randolph
and
five
of
his
brothers
attended
the
college
of
william
and
mary
his
grandson
observed
afterwards
that
in
this
family
they
never
hesitated
to
employ
their
considerable
means
for
the
purposes
of
education
it
is
not
necessary
to
add
that
their
social
connections
were
of
the
best
while
isham
was
in
his
twenties
yet
unmarried
and
still
living
at
turkey
island
he
frequently
visited
westover
and
was
on
intimate
terms
with
captain
jefferson
s
superior
officer
in
the
militia
the
second
and
most
famous
william
byrd
who
was
twelve
years
older
than
young
randolph
for
some
weeks
in
the
winter
of
after
the
colonel
had
indiscreetly
offered
to
teach
him
french
isham
was
almost
continuously
at
westover
and
had
lessons
from
his
host
making
some
progress
but
his
chief
yearning
was
for
the
sea
and
byrd
helped
him
satisfy
it
by
recommending
him
for
the
command
of
a
ship
by
the
fall
of
that
year
he
was
referring
to
isham
as
captain
and
putting
tobacco
aboard
his
vessel
intimate
social
relations
between
the
two
men
were
maintained
during
byrd
s
later
residence
in
london
it
was
probably
in
that
captain
randolph
found
a
wife
in
england
his
marriage
to
jane
daughter
of
charles
and
jane
lilburne
rogers
took
place
in
the
parish
of
white
chapel
london
she
appears
to
have
been
living
with
her
widowed
mother
a
distant
relative
of
freeborn
john
lilburne
for
his
times
and
circumstances
isham
had
married
late
but
his
wife
proved
to
be
as
prolific
as
the
other
randolph
matrons
they
had
nine
children
who
survived
infancy
the
first
of
these
jane
was
baptized
at
st
paul
s
shadwell
on
february
when
her
future
husband
was
about
thirteen
her
father
was
referred
to
as
isham
randolph
in
shakespeare
s
walk
merchant
but
he
was
known
as
captain
for
almost
twenty
years
longer
and
not
until
the
last
decade
of
his
life
did
he
wholly
abandon
the
sea
thus
there
was
a
nautical
strain
in
the
ancestry
of
president
jefferson
which
the
critics
of
his
commercial
policy
quite
overlooked
he
himself
employed
nautical
terms
in
figures
of
speech
though
he
was
not
a
good
sailor
captain
randolph
probably
made
lengthy
sojourns
in
england
after
his
marriage
and
upon
at
least
one
important
occasion
he
acted
there
as
agent
for
his
native
province
sometime
before
the
spring
of
he
made
his
last
voyage
william
byrd
then
back
in
virginia
wrote
to
an
agent
in
england
sir
john
randolph
is
dead
and
unless
his
brother
isham
return
to
his
own
element
the
sea
i
fear
he
won
t
survive
him
many
years
captain
randolph
and
his
family
were
established
at
dungeness
before
this
time
and
had
become
acquainted
with
peter
jefferson
by
inheritance
and
grant
isham
had
become
a
large
landholder
in
goochland
in
the
year
that
peter
jefferson
became
a
magistrate
randolph
got
a
patent
for
three
thousand
acres
and
in
connection
with
it
he
certified
to
the
importation
of
forty
nine
persons
into
the
colony
two
years
later
he
entered
into
agreements
whereby
two
bond
servants
in
return
for
the
time
of
servitude
due
him
should
make
for
him
respectively
one
hundred
thousand
bricks
and
two
hundred
and
fifty
pairs
of
shoes
he
was
carrying
on
extensive
building
operations
and
supporting
a
large
establishment
in
the
year
of
his
daughter
s
marriage
he
shared
a
consignment
of
three
hundred
and
eighty
negroes
his
son
in
law
had
preceded
him
as
a
pioneer
but
had
not
been
in
a
position
to
conduct
affairs
on
such
a
scale
his
circle
of
friends
was
wider
than
that
of
the
jeffersons
to
dungeness
in
came
john
bartram
the
pennsylvania
botanist
at
the
suggestion
of
peter
collinson
who
had
became
acquainted
with
isham
in
london
the
correspondent
of
benjamin
franklin
had
recommended
to
friend
bartram
that
on
one
leg
of
his
projected
journey
to
virginia
he
stop
to
see
colonel
byrd
at
westover
and
colonel
john
custis
junior
at
williamsburg
both
curious
men
and
that
he
then
proceed
to
isham
s
place
where
he
would
receive
a
warm
welcome
of
bartram
s
comments
on
his
visit
to
dungeness
and
on
the
botanical
excursions
which
he
centered
there
the
following
would
probably
have
been
the
greatest
interest
to
jane
randolph
s
plant
loving
son
there
grows
on
the
other
side
of
the
james
river
said
bartram
to
colonel
custis
a
little
above
isham
randolph
s
a
tree
the
kind
of
which
is
known
in
europe
by
the
name
of
thuyja
or
arbor
vitae
which
if
thee
could
procure
some
seed
thereof
if
it
growed
would
be
a
curious
ornament
in
thy
garden
i
doubt
not
if
thee
was
to
write
or
speak
to
isham
he
would
procure
thee
some
his
description
of
his
host
to
collinson
as
a
generous
good
natured
gentleman
and
well
respected
by
most
who
are
acquainted
with
him
may
sound
like
faint
praise
but
at
least
it
reveals
that
isham
had
the
characteristic
social
virtues
of
his
class
this
friendly
man
afterwards
regretted
that
he
could
not
entertain
his
former
guest
by
sending
him
the
account
of
some
new
discovery
and
confessed
the
want
of
a
penetrating
genius
in
the
curious
beauties
of
nature
perhaps
he
was
unduly
modest
but
unquestionably
his
scientific
curiosity
fell
short
of
that
of
his
grandson
public
service
was
expected
of
one
with
isham
randolph
s
family
connections
and
landed
possessions
and
he
would
probably
have
been
drafted
sooner
had
he
settled
earlier
upon
the
land
about
a
year
before
his
daughter
s
marriage
he
was
elected
a
burgess
for
goochland
county
but
his
entire
legislative
career
actually
extended
to
only
a
few
weeks
his
military
service
was
more
conspicuous
in
the
same
month
that
he
was
chosen
a
burgess
he
was
appointed
adjutant
general
of
the
colony
and
he
held
this
office
until
his
death
four
years
later
he
was
expected
to
go
into
various
counties
and
give
instruction
in
the
form
of
exercise
that
had
been
prepared
for
the
soldiers
the
council
which
appointed
him
described
him
as
a
well
known
gentleman
and
universally
acceptable
in
the
country
greater
military
responsibilities
soon
fell
to
his
lot
in
the
year
a
contingent
of
virginia
troops
was
raised
to
serve
with
the
british
on
the
expedition
against
the
spanish
at
carthagena
governor
gooch
took
charge
of
these
and
left
the
colony
for
a
year
during
his
absence
isham
randolph
acted
as
chief
officer
of
the
local
militia
and
for
this
reason
it
has
sometimes
been
said
that
he
was
designated
as
lieutenant
general
of
the
colony
there
were
plenty
of
military
titles
in
thomas
jefferson
s
ancestral
record
his
maternal
grandfather
may
not
have
been
a
conspicuously
martial
figure
but
at
least
isham
was
a
link
in
a
highly
honorable
military
tradition
his
successor
as
adjutant
general
was
lawrence
washington
and
when
the
latter
died
three
years
later
the
colony
was
divided
into
districts
and
four
adjutants
were
appointed
among
these
was
lawrence
s
brother
george
it
is
difficult
to
recover
the
personality
of
a
man
from
his
portrait
or
his
epitaph
it
may
be
reported
however
that
isham
randolph
appeared
in
a
picture
frame
as
a
gentleman
in
conventional
costume
wearing
a
wig
and
with
ruffles
at
his
writs
his
full
face
implied
good
living
but
it
was
also
long
and
some
people
might
see
in
it
a
resemblance
to
thomas
jefferson
even
though
the
latter
s
nose
was
rather
more
uplifted
the
epitaph
on
his
tombstone
at
turkey
island
says
that
he
possessed
the
distinguishing
qualities
of
a
gentleman
to
an
eminent
degree
and
gives
further
testimony
to
his
good
nature
by
an
easy
compliance
and
obliging
deportment
he
knew
no
enemy
but
gained
many
friends
thus
in
his
life
meriting
an
universal
esteem
he
died
at
the
age
of
fifty
seven
in
november
three
years
after
the
marriage
of
his
daughter
to
peter
jefferson
and
only
a
few
months
before
the
birth
of
their
first
son
peter
was
older
than
the
average
when
he
married
just
as
his
father
in
law
had
been
his
wife
had
been
promised
a
dowry
of
two
hundred
pounds
sterling
but
isham
had
not
paid
it
by
the
time
he
made
his
will
jane
randolph
probably
took
a
body
servant
or
so
with
her
but
she
seems
to
have
brought
her
husband
no
land
that
was
generally
left
to
sons
if
there
were
any
the
rising
young
planter
acquired
no
fortune
by
his
marriage
but
he
gained
for
his
unborn
children
a
far
more
extensive
and
influential
family
connection
than
he
himself
had
enjoyed
it
is
likely
that
the
couple
began
their
married
life
comfortably
but
modestly
at
fine
creek
and
that
their
first
two
children
were
born
there
four
or
five
years
before
his
marriage
peter
had
staked
out
a
claim
on
the
rivanna
below
the
gap
in
the
southwest
mountains
the
date
of
his
earliest
known
grant
in
this
remote
region
was
june
when
his
future
wife
was
only
fourteen
he
may
have
made
his
surveys
before
the
leaves
fell
and
he
certainly
received
a
patent
for
one
thousand
acres
before
the
passing
of
another
summer
his
tract
extended
southward
from
secretary
s
ford
just
above
the
mountains
and
included
the
late
site
of
monticello
and
a
body
of
bottom
land
below
the
little
river
within
a
year
he
began
to
look
for
a
more
suitable
homesite
than
his
own
lands
afforded
his
friend
william
randolph
of
tuckahoe
who
had
probably
interested
him
in
this
region
in
the
first
place
had
acquired
lands
north
of
the
rivanna
which
were
still
undeveloped
peter
made
a
deal
whereby
he
acquired
two
hundred
acres
of
these
in
return
for
a
bowl
of
arrack
punch
concocted
by
henry
wetherburn
of
the
raleigh
tavern
in
williamsburg
not
until
two
years
after
his
marriage
however
did
peter
round
out
the
home
tract
he
then
acquired
two
hundred
acres
more
from
his
friend
and
made
a
cash
payment
for
the
whole
meanwhile
he
had
patented
another
small
body
of
land
south
of
the
river
it
was
probably
in
the
year
that
he
began
building
on
a
spot
whence
he
could
look
downward
at
a
stream
or
upward
toward
the
mountains
and
it
was
here
that
thomas
was
born
two
years
later
the
domain
in
this
district
to
which
the
boy
became
heir
apparent
was
modest
the
acreage
to
which
peter
had
title
was
not
extensive
by
virginia
standards
and
was
not
immediately
increased
in
that
era
of
land
grabbing
he
received
large
grants
elsewhere
but
there
is
no
certain
way
of
knowing
how
many
of
these
he
was
ever
able
to
perfect
and
on
one
occasion
the
all
powerful
council
administered
a
distinct
rebuff
by
rejecting
one
of
his
petitions
as
unreasonable
he
may
have
over
reached
himself
but
in
view
of
the
success
of
others
it
seems
more
probable
that
despite
his
connection
with
the
randolphs
he
lacked
influence
at
the
seat
of
power
on
the
whole
he
was
a
modest
speculator
in
land
in
comparison
with
his
mighty
contemporaries
in
the
province
and
even
with
certain
of
his
near
neighbors
in
the
rivanna
region
however
he
had
the
distinction
of
being
one
of
the
first
settlers
and
this
was
always
a
matter
of
pride
to
his
son
though
unexpected
events
interrupted
his
stay
peter
played
an
important
part
in
the
organization
of
a
county
which
boasts
many
distinguished
sons
but
has
been
most
glorified
by
the
name
of
jefferson
in
september
because
of
the
inconvenience
attending
the
upper
inhabitants
of
goochland
the
assembly
provided
that
after
the
last
day
of
december
the
existing
county
should
be
divided
and
a
new
one
bearing
the
euphonious
name
of
albemarle
be
formed
peter
jefferson
who
had
been
a
magistrate
in
the
old
county
attended
the
first
meeting
for
organization
in
february
and
took
oath
as
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
a
judge
of
the
court
of
chancery
thus
becoming
one
of
the
first
magistrates
and
first
gentlemen
of
the
new
one
associated
with
him
on
this
occasion
was
joshua
fry
a
former
teacher
of
mathematics
at
the
college
of
william
and
mary
who
was
now
living
on
hardware
river
near
carter
s
bridge
in
march
fry
became
county
surveyor
and
county
lieutenant
that
is
the
chief
officer
while
peter
jefferson
became
lieutenant
colonel
after
a
few
weeks
however
he
practically
ceased
attending
meetings
of
the
county
court
in
albemarle
and
he
soon
returned
to
the
goochland
side
taking
his
young
family
with
him
his
return
was
at
the
request
of
his
friend
william
randolph
now
also
referred
to
as
colonel
who
had
suffered
other
misfortunes
than
that
of
becoming
his
own
master
too
soon
he
had
married
early
and
well
but
by
the
age
of
thirty
had
become
a
widower
his
wife
was
the
daughter
of
mann
page
whose
house
at
rosewell
in
gloucester
county
is
said
to
have
contained
thirty
five
rooms
john
page
the
companion
of
thomas
jefferson
s
youth
and
young
manhood
was
her
nephew
she
had
borne
william
randolph
two
daughters
and
a
son
who
was
given
the
names
of
his
two
grandfathers
thomas
mann
randolph
was
a
couple
of
years
older
than
thomas
jefferson
who
could
say
afterwards
that
he
had
known
him
all
his
life
after
his
wife
died
william
of
tuckahoe
made
a
will
wherein
he
named
peter
as
one
of
his
executors
three
years
later
foreseeing
his
approaching
death
he
added
a
codicil
in
which
he
included
the
request
that
his
dear
and
loving
friend
should
move
down
with
his
own
family
to
the
tuckahoe
house
and
remain
there
until
randolph
s
son
was
grown
in
the
technical
sense
peter
jefferson
was
not
the
guardian
of
thomas
mann
randolph
but
the
children
remained
at
tuckahoe
with
the
jefferson
family
large
monetary
bequests
had
been
made
to
the
girls
and
the
balance
of
the
estate
was
to
go
to
the
son
as
the
resident
executor
peter
was
the
custodian
of
the
land
and
in
the
practical
sense
he
was
far
more
than
a
guardian
his
economic
status
was
considerably
more
modest
than
that
of
william
randolph
but
in
view
of
his
standing
as
magistrate
and
friend
it
seems
impossible
that
he
could
have
been
asked
to
assume
an
undignified
position
in
general
he
did
such
things
at
tuckahoe
as
the
master
himself
would
have
done
had
he
been
there
doubtless
doing
most
of
them
a
good
deal
better
it
is
surprising
however
that
he
should
have
been
willing
to
leave
his
own
lands
in
order
to
care
for
those
of
another
besides
being
an
act
of
loyal
friendship
his
move
must
have
seemed
advantageous
to
both
families
he
directed
the
activities
of
at
least
seven
overseers
at
tuckahoe
and
reported
the
production
of
far
more
tobacco
on
colonel
randolph
s
quarters
than
he
could
have
expected
from
his
own
fields
in
albemarle
his
smaller
holdings
there
were
still
largely
forested
and
he
probably
thought
it
desirable
to
leave
the
task
of
pioneering
to
an
overseer
and
his
gang
planters
often
did
that
before
moving
their
families
into
new
lands
in
the
piedmont
while
at
tuckahoe
he
could
keep
his
eye
on
his
fine
creek
property
which
lay
near
one
of
the
randolph
quarters
peter
jefferson
kept
his
accounts
methodically
as
his
son
did
afterwards
but
those
which
remain
do
not
reveal
how
much
he
received
for
his
services
to
the
estate
the
traditional
report
that
he
got
only
his
living
expenses
is
probably
correct
but
the
food
and
lodging
of
his
growing
family
constituted
a
considerable
item
and
he
was
unquestionably
a
more
prosperous
man
after
this
period
than
he
had
been
before
though
he
did
not
stay
as
long
as
william
of
tuckahoe
had
desired
he
guarded
the
land
and
the
heir
for
six
or
seven
years
altogether
thus
it
came
about
that
the
home
of
thomas
jefferson
s
earliest
remembrance
was
a
randolph
place
the
colonel
achieved
his
reputation
as
an
explorer
while
they
were
all
living
there
then
during
the
few
years
that
remained
to
him
after
their
return
to
albemarle
he
gained
greater
local
prominence
and
developed
the
estate
which
his
son
inherited
ii
the
services
of
peter
jefferson
the
earliest
recollection
of
thomas
jefferson
was
of
being
carried
on
a
pillow
by
a
mounted
slave
on
the
journey
from
shadwell
to
tuckahoe
the
circumstances
must
have
been
specially
impressive
for
he
was
only
two
or
three
years
old
at
the
time
he
had
now
ceased
to
be
the
youngest
member
of
the
family
but
he
was
still
the
only
boy
at
the
age
of
twenty
months
he
had
acquired
a
third
sister
and
a
fourth
was
born
shortly
after
he
turned
three
two
more
boys
were
born
at
tuckahoe
but
one
lived
only
a
few
weeks
and
the
other
did
not
survive
a
day
the
five
young
jeffersons
and
the
three
young
randolphs
comprised
a
good
sized
group
of
children
and
doubtless
a
lively
one
if
the
house
was
then
completed
in
its
historic
external
form
as
seems
probable
they
could
have
lived
almost
as
two
separate
families
thereby
diminishing
domestic
confusion
to
some
degree
it
had
two
distinct
wings
which
were
connected
by
a
large
room
or
salon
and
thus
it
assumed
the
shape
of
the
letter
h
one
of
the
wings
had
brick
ends
but
otherwise
it
was
a
frame
structure
painted
white
at
that
time
it
may
not
have
contained
the
fine
panelling
and
rich
stairways
which
were
seen
in
it
later
but
the
rooms
had
high
ceilings
and
were
airy
jefferson
was
there
as
a
little
boy
and
he
often
stopped
with
thomas
mann
randolph
after
he
grew
up
but
he
saw
no
reason
to
describe
such
a
familiar
house
in
letters
architecture
of
this
sort
did
not
impress
him
after
he
was
attracted
to
classic
columns
and
had
begun
to
dream
of
stateliness
but
this
home
of
his
first
memories
set
above
a
greater
stream
than
the
rivanna
always
must
have
seemed
an
exceedingly
pleasant
place
colonel
jefferson
was
directly
charged
to
carry
out
william
randolph
s
instructions
about
the
education
of
his
son
the
heir
was
not
to
be
sent
to
the
college
of
william
and
mary
or
to
england
on
any
account
whatever
but
private
tutors
were
to
be
employed
for
his
instruction
thus
the
credible
tradition
arose
that
young
tom
jefferson
first
studied
under
young
tom
randolph
s
teacher
in
a
little
house
still
standing
in
the
yard
this
part
of
his
education
he
afterwards
described
as
the
english
school
without
giving
any
details
presumably
the
tutor
taught
the
boys
and
girls
together
as
philip
fithian
did
in
the
household
of
councillor
robert
carter
at
nomini
hall
but
even
in
that
case
this
class
like
all
the
others
he
was
ever
a
member
of
was
small
in
the
absence
of
authentic
information
his
boyhood
and
schooldays
at
tuckahoe
must
be
left
to
the
imagination
it
is
said
that
once
when
desperate
with
hunger
he
fervently
repeated
the
lord
s
prayer
in
the
hope
of
hastening
a
meal
the
implication
is
clear
that
he
received
conventional
religious
instruction
but
there
is
certainly
no
suggestion
that
there
was
any
shortage
of
food
in
this
and
in
other
respects
his
father
was
a
good
provider
peter
jefferson
was
more
than
that
he
was
not
merely
providing
a
comfortable
home
for
his
family
while
doing
a
service
to
a
dead
friend
he
was
also
venturing
far
from
the
tobacco
fields
upon
occasion
and
carving
a
reputation
for
himself
out
of
the
wilderness
if
his
career
is
at
all
memorable
for
its
own
sake
and
not
solely
as
a
brief
prologue
to
one
that
was
illustrious
it
is
because
of
what
he
did
as
a
surveyor
of
boundaries
and
a
maker
of
maps
during
the
years
that
he
had
headquarters
at
tuckahoe
this
record
of
exploits
and
achievements
constituted
also
the
most
distinctive
part
of
the
heritage
that
he
transmitted
to
his
descendants
we
have
a
detailed
account
of
one
of
the
expeditions
he
went
on
his
son
was
not
yet
four
years
old
when
peter
helped
mark
what
was
known
afterwards
as
the
fairfax
line
it
is
a
pity
that
the
boy
was
not
old
enough
to
hear
the
story
of
this
hazardous
adventure
while
the
father
s
memory
of
it
was
fresh
the
colonel
was
never
much
of
a
talker
however
he
was
a
man
of
action
between
the
potomac
and
the
rappahannock
lay
the
vast
domain
of
lord
fairfax
known
as
the
northern
neck
it
was
a
part
of
the
province
of
virginia
so
far
as
government
was
concerned
but
title
to
the
soil
lay
with
the
proprietor
the
western
limits
of
this
princely
estate
were
long
the
subject
of
dispute
but
finally
by
order
of
the
privy
council
the
boundary
was
drawn
for
seventy
six
miles
between
the
headspring
of
the
rappahannock
that
is
the
source
of
the
conway
or
rapidan
across
mountain
ranges
and
primeval
wilderness
to
the
headspring
of
the
potomac
which
was
already
marked
this
was
the
fairfax
line
the
members
of
the
expedition
who
assembled
below
the
blue
ridge
in
september
comprised
some
forty
men
and
at
the
start
they
had
about
that
many
horses
there
were
commissioners
for
the
crown
and
for
lord
fairfax
the
former
including
joshua
fry
of
albemarle
county
and
there
were
surveyors
who
had
been
deputed
by
these
gentlemen
colonel
jefferson
and
robert
brooke
had
been
named
for
the
crown
captain
benjamin
winslow
and
thomas
lewis
for
the
proprietor
it
was
lewis
who
recorded
in
crude
but
graphic
language
the
story
of
the
journey
the
journey
out
from
the
head
of
the
conway
rapidan
to
the
headspring
of
the
potomac
where
they
drank
the
king
s
health
and
set
up
the
fairfax
stone
required
four
weeks
the
trip
back
to
the
starting
point
where
they
drank
healths
even
more
lustily
and
set
up
another
stone
took
three
the
preparations
had
been
elaborate
but
this
was
no
pleasure
trip
even
for
the
commissioners
who
generally
went
with
the
baggage
by
the
easiest
route
colonel
jefferson
and
the
other
surveyors
had
to
follow
the
direct
line
wherever
it
went
though
they
always
remained
mounted
as
long
as
they
could
it
took
them
over
successive
ranges
of
mountains
that
were
prodigiously
full
of
fallen
timber
and
ivey
up
and
down
precipices
where
the
horses
slipped
and
fell
and
through
swamps
of
laurel
which
appeared
impenetrable
one
dreadful
place
they
called
purgatory
and
one
stream
dismal
enough
to
strike
terror
in
any
human
creature
they
named
the
styx
several
of
the
unfortunate
horses
were
killed
and
all
of
them
nearly
starved
the
surveyors
suffered
repeated
falls
and
were
in
constant
danger
one
of
them
fainted
in
a
swamp
which
almost
became
his
tomb
colonel
jefferson
and
captain
winslow
were
older
than
the
other
two
and
they
generally
went
together
when
the
group
worked
in
pairs
for
peter
at
thirty
nine
the
expedition
was
a
feat
of
endurance
but
the
only
sign
of
weakness
he
gave
was
that
once
he
was
much
indisposed
thomas
jefferson
never
stood
on
the
top
of
the
alleghanies
where
his
father
crossed
nor
saw
the
initials
p
j
carved
on
a
beech
near
the
fairfax
stone
the
information
about
the
topography
of
his
native
region
which
he
incorporated
in
his
notes
on
virginia
was
gained
from
several
sources
but
from
his
father
he
could
have
learned
that
the
mountains
are
not
solitary
and
scattered
confusedly
over
the
face
of
the
country
but
are
disposed
in
ridges
one
behind
another
he
appears
not
to
have
referred
in
writing
to
his
father
s
connection
with
the
fairfax
line
but
undoubtedly
he
knew
of
peter
s
victories
over
the
wilderness
and
was
heartened
by
them
though
he
himself
was
an
explorer
and
a
pioneer
of
another
sort
on
november
after
the
senior
surveyor
for
the
crown
had
carved
his
initials
on
a
birch
tree
near
the
head
of
conway
he
set
out
for
home
the
other
surveyors
joined
him
at
tuckahoe
early
in
the
new
year
and
by
the
last
week
in
february
their
joint
labors
were
completed
at
a
greater
age
tom
would
have
been
deeply
interested
in
their
doings
the
map
of
the
northern
neck
that
was
sent
to
england
was
described
as
drawn
by
peter
jefferson
and
robert
brooke
for
the
region
east
of
the
blue
ridge
they
followed
the
earlier
map
of
mayo
but
they
incorporated
enough
new
material
about
the
valley
of
virginia
to
give
their
own
map
the
value
of
a
source
record
needless
to
say
this
map
showed
for
the
first
time
the
fairfax
line
the
name
of
joshua
fry
is
linked
with
that
of
peter
jefferson
in
the
most
important
of
the
latter
s
activities
as
a
surveyor
in
effect
if
not
in
fact
the
two
men
constituted
a
partnership
somewhat
more
than
three
years
after
they
helped
set
up
the
fairfax
stone
they
surveyed
the
dividing
line
between
virginia
and
north
carolina
for
ninety
miles
beyond
the
point
where
william
byrd
and
his
fellow
commissioners
had
left
it
a
score
of
years
before
unfortunately
no
chronicler
was
present
to
record
their
exploits
and
except
for
his
plan
such
documents
as
the
junior
surveyor
left
appear
to
have
been
destroyed
the
byrd
party
had
carried
the
line
to
peter
s
creek
in
the
fall
of
colonel
fry
and
colonel
jefferson
extended
it
to
steep
rock
creek
in
what
is
now
washington
county
the
plan
itself
shows
that
they
crossed
new
river
and
many
small
streams
and
several
ranges
of
mountains
the
hardships
and
perils
that
they
met
must
have
been
talked
about
in
tom
s
presence
for
they
became
a
tradition
in
his
family
years
later
his
grandchildren
repeated
stories
which
must
have
come
through
him
that
these
men
had
to
defend
themselves
against
wild
beasts
by
day
and
to
sleep
in
the
trees
at
night
that
their
provisions
ran
low
and
they
had
to
live
on
raw
flesh
that
peter
s
courage
did
not
fail
when
his
companions
fainted
from
exhaustion
beside
him
he
and
fry
went
further
than
they
had
gone
when
drawing
the
fairfax
line
and
both
of
them
were
now
older
for
their
extraordinary
trouble
and
painful
service
however
they
did
not
go
unrewarded
before
the
end
of
the
year
they
reported
their
proceedings
to
the
council
produced
an
account
of
their
expenses
and
presented
their
maps
then
the
members
of
that
body
unanimously
agreed
that
each
of
them
was
deserving
of
three
hundred
pounds
sterling
beyond
all
expenses
nor
were
their
abilities
forgotten
some
months
later
the
acting
governor
following
a
directive
from
the
lords
of
trade
selected
them
as
the
best
qualified
persons
to
draw
a
map
of
the
inhabited
part
of
virginia
in
october
the
honorable
lewis
burwell
whose
daughter
was
wooed
unsuccessfully
by
the
son
of
peter
jefferson
asked
the
opinion
of
the
council
in
regard
to
their
compensation
each
was
thought
deserving
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
sterling
for
his
expense
and
trouble
their
map
was
done
by
that
time
and
unlike
the
original
materials
on
which
it
was
based
it
has
withstood
the
ravages
of
fire
and
time
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
was
printed
it
appeared
in
london
in
and
a
second
edition
containing
improvements
by
john
dalrymple
chiefly
in
the
form
of
wagon
roads
was
issued
four
years
later
this
second
map
was
reproduced
in
successive
atlases
and
its
superiority
to
all
others
up
to
the
time
that
thomas
jefferson
compiled
his
notes
on
virginia
was
generally
recognized
for
geographical
knowledge
of
his
native
country
therefore
he
and
his
contemporaries
were
deeply
indebted
to
his
father
john
henry
father
of
patrick
published
a
map
in
but
this
was
not
based
on
original
surveys
and
it
has
generally
been
regarded
as
an
inaccurate
compilation
jefferson
subscribed
for
it
but
he
probably
had
no
more
respect
for
it
than
he
had
for
the
legal
training
of
john
henry
s
son
soon
after
his
map
was
published
peter
returned
to
shadwell
from
tuckahoe
his
record
of
the
tobacco
crops
on
colonel
randolph
s
quarters
ends
with
thenceforth
he
farmed
his
own
lands
and
rounded
out
his
own
estate
he
drew
no
more
major
boundary
lines
but
he
was
county
surveyor
in
goochland
that
year
he
was
again
a
magistrate
of
albemarle
by
the
following
spring
and
a
couple
of
years
after
that
he
became
county
surveyor
there
in
succession
to
joshua
fry
who
had
just
died
at
fort
cumberland
while
commanding
the
virginia
forces
on
the
frontier
george
washington
was
his
lieutenant
fry
has
been
credited
with
being
the
chief
constructive
influence
in
the
life
of
peter
jefferson
and
not
improperly
his
good
will
continued
to
manifest
itself
after
he
was
dead
he
named
his
associate
an
executor
of
his
will
left
him
the
surveying
instruments
which
they
had
used
together
and
in
effect
bequeathed
him
his
major
public
offices
colonel
jefferson
had
been
made
the
second
military
officer
of
albemarle
when
the
county
was
formed
he
now
succeeded
fry
as
county
lieutenant
and
also
as
a
member
of
the
house
of
burgesses
he
served
during
two
sessions
of
the
assembly
in
and
but
presumably
he
did
not
stand
for
re
election
his
legislative
career
was
approximately
as
brief
and
unimportant
as
that
of
his
father
in
law
isham
randolph
but
his
service
as
county
lieutenant
appears
to
have
lasted
until
the
end
of
his
life
he
did
nothing
in
particular
in
the
french
and
indian
war
but
he
was
the
chief
officer
and
the
first
citizen
of
the
county
during
much
of
this
time
tom
was
away
from
home
at
school
in
goochland
but
when
the
boy
returned
to
look
at
the
mountains
and
flourish
in
the
sunshine
of
albemarle
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
his
established
position
in
the
community
tom
was
about
nine
years
old
when
the
family
moved
back
to
shadwell
not
until
after
his
father
s
death
five
years
later
did
he
observe
the
full
procession
of
the
seasons
in
albemarle
but
he
was
here
during
vacations
at
least
and
henceforth
this
place
was
home
it
provided
the
domestic
background
of
his
life
until
he
was
twenty
seven
no
mansion
ever
stood
on
this
homesite
but
his
father
erected
a
substantial
group
of
plantation
buildings
before
he
died
he
either
enlarged
the
little
house
in
which
the
boy
had
been
born
or
built
another
wooden
structure
for
the
central
unit
and
he
added
a
dairy
smoke
house
and
other
outbuildings
of
the
sort
until
he
had
a
frontage
of
more
than
two
hundred
feet
above
the
river
to
the
southward
the
land
sloped
for
several
hundred
yards
to
the
rivanna
where
he
had
a
water
mill
this
occupied
a
good
deal
of
his
son
s
attention
later
on
the
three
notched
road
passed
the
place
on
the
north
much
as
the
highway
does
today
and
proceeding
westward
through
the
gap
crossed
the
stream
at
the
secretary
s
ford
the
ridge
of
the
southwest
mountains
which
is
broken
at
this
gap
enters
the
present
county
in
the
extreme
northeast
and
there
it
reaches
its
greatest
height
fifteen
hundred
feet
in
a
knob
which
came
to
be
called
peter
s
mountain
for
colonel
jefferson
as
his
son
said
all
the
virginia
mountains
run
in
the
same
direction
from
northeast
to
southwest
but
these
being
the
first
discovered
appropriated
the
latter
name
to
themselves
the
range
roughly
parallels
the
blue
ridge
about
twenty
miles
away
on
its
slopes
tom
hunted
and
beneath
them
many
of
the
first
plantation
houses
nestled
there
may
have
been
better
sites
on
the
western
side
whence
the
eye
could
command
the
blue
ridge
but
settlers
had
been
attracted
first
to
the
eastern
which
faced
the
sunrise
properties
ran
in
generous
strips
from
the
wooded
summits
to
the
lowlands
the
largest
of
these
dated
back
to
a
grant
of
more
than
thirteen
thousand
acres
to
nicholas
meriwether
which
was
referred
to
as
the
grant
because
it
was
so
early
and
so
huge
this
included
the
site
of
castle
hill
some
eight
miles
from
shadwell
though
no
plantation
house
had
been
erected
there
as
yet
a
considerable
part
of
this
lordly
estate
eventually
came
into
the
possession
of
dr
thomas
walker
wherever
he
may
have
been
living
when
the
jeffersons
came
back
he
soon
served
peter
as
a
friend
and
his
son
john
afterwards
became
intimate
with
tom
closer
at
hand
was
john
harvie
who
had
bought
lands
adjoining
the
william
randolph
property
it
is
uncertain
just
when
he
built
belmont
but
from
an
early
time
he
was
a
near
neighbor
as
nearness
was
understood
in
albemarle
the
shadwell
tract
proper
consisted
of
only
four
hundred
acres
but
colonel
jefferson
soon
purchased
the
place
on
the
same
side
of
the
river
that
was
later
known
as
pantops
his
son
always
liked
this
because
of
its
magnificent
view
south
of
the
river
peter
s
lands
stretched
toward
carter
s
mountain
and
included
not
only
the
site
of
monticello
but
also
a
small
tract
which
he
had
patented
in
and
which
was
known
as
partibello
to
this
he
now
added
another
of
the
same
size
called
tufton
he
also
patented
a
body
of
woodland
which
is
identified
on
thomas
jefferson
s
land
roll
as
pouncey
s
approximately
two
thousand
six
hundred
and
fifty
acres
that
the
latter
afterwards
held
in
this
part
of
the
county
were
acquired
by
his
father
peter
jefferson
was
also
increasing
his
holdings
and
developing
his
lands
in
another
part
of
albermarle
three
more
children
joined
the
family
after
the
removal
from
tuckahoe
including
the
twins
one
of
whom
was
a
boy
named
randolph
peter
built
up
for
his
sons
two
estates
of
practically
the
same
size
one
centering
at
shadwell
and
the
other
on
the
south
fork
of
the
james
sometimes
called
the
fluvanna
soon
after
the
county
was
formed
the
assembly
had
empowered
him
joshua
fry
and
others
to
expend
one
hundred
pounds
in
clearing
the
latter
stream
of
rocks
which
in
several
places
obstructed
navigation
it
was
broader
there
than
the
north
branch
or
rivanna
and
unlike
it
served
an
important
function
in
starting
the
money
crop
on
the
way
to
market
while
the
jeffersons
were
still
at
tuckahoe
there
had
been
a
notable
advance
in
the
use
of
canoes
above
the
fall
line
this
was
owing
to
the
ingenuity
of
the
reverend
robert
rose
a
large
planter
who
lashed
two
of
these
tottering
vehicles
together
and
thus
enabled
them
to
carry
eight
or
nine
hogsheads
of
tobacco
at
a
time
without
tipping
peter
s
tobacco
from
the
rivanna
district
had
to
go
by
land
either
by
wagon
or
by
the
crude
method
of
rolling
in
specially
constructed
hogsheads
but
he
was
able
to
employ
water
transportation
on
the
fluvanna
his
main
place
there
he
named
snowdon
after
the
mountains
in
wales
near
the
reputed
home
of
his
ancestors
in
his
lifetime
the
fluvanna
district
was
the
more
important
part
of
the
county
the
courthouse
was
there
near
the
present
town
of
scottsville
he
was
one
of
the
persons
who
had
determined
the
location
and
he
owned
houses
at
the
ferry
crossing
which
he
leased
to
the
keeper
of
an
ordinary
this
was
about
twenty
five
miles
from
shadwell
not
until
the
region
below
the
fluvanna
had
been
separated
from
albemarle
after
thomas
jefferson
went
to
college
was
the
town
of
charlottesville
established
by
law
and
the
courthouse
located
there
it
was
built
on
its
present
site
about
four
miles
west
of
shadwell
this
was
too
late
to
do
peter
jefferson
any
good
but
it
was
a
convenience
to
his
son
as
a
practising
lawyer
even
during
the
revolution
the
county
seat
contained
little
besides
a
courthouse
a
tavern
and
a
dozen
houses
a
traveler
then
observed
that
the
region
when
viewed
from
one
of
its
many
eminences
appeared
as
a
vast
forest
interspersed
with
plantations
four
or
five
miles
apart
and
resembling
small
villages
this
was
no
land
of
bustling
towns
nor
predominantly
of
small
farms
as
a
rule
holdings
were
larger
than
in
the
shenandoah
valley
though
smaller
than
in
tidewater
when
peter
jefferson
knew
the
region
and
his
son
was
a
boy
this
was
a
silent
country
of
far
flung
patriarchal
seats
though
these
were
without
architectural
pretension
afterwards
plain
farmhouses
on
smaller
clearings
increased
in
number
in
the
bottoms
and
on
the
lower
slopes
the
red
soil
was
rich
in
its
virginal
state
before
it
was
exhausted
by
tobacco
or
ravaged
by
erosion
the
temperate
climate
was
favorable
to
virginia
s
historic
crop
and
also
to
the
fruit
trees
and
grains
which
peter
jefferson
s
son
afterwards
encouraged
while
the
dogwood
the
redbud
and
the
shadbush
made
this
a
sylvan
paradise
in
spring
by
all
prevailing
standards
the
district
was
healthful
the
inhabitants
often
spoke
of
themselves
as
mountaineers
and
congratulated
themselves
on
their
freedom
from
agues
and
fevers
before
thomas
jefferson
was
grown
one
of
them
said
the
descent
of
our
lands
is
so
quick
that
morasses
are
scarcely
known
among
us
and
the
rapidity
of
our
waters
so
great
that
none
of
them
has
leisure
to
stagnate
but
the
very
rapidity
of
these
waters
increased
the
difficulties
of
transportation
which
more
than
any
other
single
factor
distinguished
the
piedmont
from
the
region
of
the
lower
james
the
large
planters
had
slaves
to
perform
the
cruder
tasks
of
pioneering
and
they
brought
with
them
the
agricultural
economy
and
the
social
traditions
of
tidewater
but
in
this
isolated
region
they
could
not
reproduce
precisely
the
life
of
westover
or
turkey
island
or
even
of
tuckahoe
styles
were
simpler
here
self
sufficiency
was
more
imperative
and
one
might
expect
an
even
more
notable
spirit
of
personal
independence
to
be
engendered
for
years
after
peter
jefferson
became
a
magistrate
wolf
bounties
were
listed
at
sessions
of
the
county
court
seventy
pounds
of
tobacco
for
a
young
wolf
and
twice
that
much
for
an
old
one
there
were
no
indians
here
when
the
first
settlers
came
and
during
the
french
and
indian
war
this
was
not
among
the
frontier
counties
but
in
the
tier
just
before
them
fears
of
raids
were
voiced
at
that
time
but
this
had
ceased
to
be
a
frontier
region
in
the
precise
sense
despite
its
vast
body
of
uncleared
lands
it
had
an
ordered
if
dispersed
society
nevertheless
residents
of
albemarle
remembered
that
joshua
fry
and
peter
jefferson
had
penetrated
uncharted
country
and
men
associated
with
the
county
followed
their
example
thomas
walker
of
castle
hill
carried
on
the
dividing
line
from
the
point
where
they
had
left
it
and
george
rogers
clark
who
was
born
across
the
southwest
mountains
from
shadwell
just
about
the
time
that
peter
returned
conquered
the
northwest
during
the
revolution
his
younger
and
equally
redheaded
brother
william
clark
was
born
in
another
county
after
his
family
had
left
this
one
but
meriwether
lewis
whose
name
is
linked
with
his
in
the
history
of
exploration
was
a
native
under
the
direction
of
president
jefferson
they
crossed
a
continent
the
tradition
of
the
wilderness
persisted
in
albemarle
in
this
congenial
locality
peter
jefferson
kept
on
surveying
lands
and
developing
his
farms
until
his
great
strength
began
to
fail
despite
his
reputed
ability
to
head
up
two
hogsheads
of
tobacco
at
the
same
time
he
died
when
he
was
still
less
than
fifty
his
elder
son
then
lanky
at
fourteen
was
never
to
be
quite
that
strong
but
was
destined
to
live
much
longer
perhaps
the
sire
had
given
too
freely
of
a
strength
that
had
seemed
so
abundant
perhaps
he
had
exposed
himself
to
too
many
hardships
or
it
may
be
that
the
unknown
malady
which
assailed
him
in
the
summer
of
could
have
been
cured
at
a
later
stage
in
the
progress
of
medicine
there
were
only
two
physicians
in
the
county
at
the
time
and
their
practice
was
incidental
dr
walker
who
attended
him
is
best
known
to
history
as
an
explorer
and
land
speculator
his
professional
visits
to
his
friend
were
numerous
and
his
services
were
as
skillful
as
could
have
been
expected
they
were
unavailing
however
for
the
patient
died
on
august
he
had
become
a
man
of
substantial
property
though
it
would
be
an
exaggeration
to
call
him
a
land
baron
the
rivanna
and
fluvanna
tracts
together
comprised
not
far
from
five
thousand
acres
and
he
had
at
least
half
that
many
more
chiefly
in
the
county
as
then
constituted
he
also
had
certain
speculative
claims
including
an
interest
in
the
loyal
land
company
with
dr
walker
and
others
for
his
time
he
was
not
much
of
a
speculator
however
and
his
son
was
never
one
at
all
the
list
of
his
slaves
is
impressive
he
had
more
than
sixty
of
them
along
with
twenty
five
horses
seventy
head
of
cattle
and
two
hundred
hogs
these
and
other
material
details
were
revealed
by
the
inventory
of
his
considerable
estate
and
the
will
which
he
drew
a
few
months
before
he
died
discloses
the
careful
provisions
he
made
for
the
future
welfare
of
his
wife
his
two
sons
and
his
six
daughters
he
prescribed
an
eminently
fair
distribution
he
provided
for
his
wife
by
leaving
her
for
her
lifetime
the
house
and
plantation
at
shadwell
together
with
a
sufficient
portion
of
the
slaves
stock
and
horses
he
left
to
each
of
his
children
a
body
servant
and
to
each
of
his
daughters
a
carefully
safeguarded
portion
of
two
hundred
pounds
to
be
paid
within
a
year
of
her
marriage
or
twenty
first
birthday
he
fully
maintained
the
standard
of
isham
randolph
and
he
was
determined
that
future
husbands
should
not
be
kept
waiting
he
did
not
weigh
the
scales
heavily
in
favor
of
the
elder
son
and
none
of
the
property
was
entailed
that
son
did
not
forget
the
lesson
when
he
became
twenty
one
thomas
was
to
have
either
the
lands
on
the
rivanna
or
the
fluvanna
as
he
should
choose
along
with
a
proper
share
of
the
livestock
half
of
the
slaves
not
otherwise
disposed
of
and
the
residue
of
the
estate
the
lands
that
he
did
not
choose
were
to
go
ultimately
to
his
brother
randolph
along
with
a
similar
portion
of
the
slaves
and
stock
as
the
residuary
legatee
he
got
the
larger
share
but
the
distribution
of
property
between
him
and
his
young
brother
was
certainly
far
more
equitable
than
the
distribution
of
talents
thomas
also
got
his
father
s
books
mathematical
instruments
cherry
tree
desk
and
bookcase
and
his
designated
servant
the
mulatto
fellow
sawney
was
the
most
valuable
slave
the
estate
was
a
going
concern
during
the
remaining
years
of
his
minority
and
provided
for
the
family
comfortably
john
harvie
was
the
working
executor
there
were
fewer
overseers
than
there
had
been
at
tuckahoe
generally
there
were
three
and
the
tobacco
crop
was
only
about
half
of
what
had
come
from
colonel
randolph
s
quarters
though
much
corn
was
raised
and
sold
food
fuel
and
some
clothing
came
from
the
place
and
the
actual
monetary
requirements
were
slight
by
any
modern
standard
even
after
his
death
peter
jefferson
continued
to
be
a
good
provider
he
had
selected
men
of
substance
as
his
executors
young
thomas
jefferson
consulted
john
harvie
and
colonel
peter
randolph
occasionally
and
he
maintained
affectionate
relations
with
thomas
turpin
who
was
his
uncle
by
marriage
but
the
one
with
whom
he
had
most
to
do
in
later
years
was
thomas
walker
not
until
he
was
grown
could
thomas
jefferson
do
anything
about
the
land
and
the
slaves
his
father
left
him
it
is
uncertain
just
when
he
began
to
use
the
mathematical
instruments
that
he
inherited
but
he
was
interested
in
surveying
throughout
his
maturity
in
spirit
at
least
he
could
follow
the
trail
across
untrodden
mountains
and
as
a
drafts
man
drawing
plats
and
house
plans
he
was
also
his
father
s
son
he
probably
used
the
cherry
tree
desk
in
posting
early
accounts
as
he
had
so
often
seen
the
colonel
do
one
reason
for
leaving
him
the
bookcase
was
that
he
had
gone
to
it
very
frequently
already
the
forty
volumes
he
is
known
to
have
inherited
constituted
an
insignificant
library
in
the
light
of
his
mature
standards
but
they
formed
the
nucleus
of
his
first
collection
one
can
assume
nothing
in
particular
about
the
first
master
of
shad
well
from
the
inventory
list
bible
and
prayer
book
were
there
as
in
almost
every
planter
s
library
along
with
books
useful
to
a
magistrate
there
were
several
volumes
of
addison
and
of
english
history
a
work
in
astronomy
some
books
of
a
geographical
nature
and
six
or
eight
maps
thomas
jefferson
s
statement
in
old
age
about
his
father
s
neglected
education
must
be
coupled
with
the
further
comment
that
he
had
strong
native
intelligence
and
improved
himself
this
is
certainly
not
to
say
however
that
this
practical
and
mathematical
man
ever
became
an
inveterate
reader
there
were
reputable
planters
who
had
fewer
books
than
he
but
he
did
not
have
many
his
major
acquisitions
were
of
another
sort
and
his
achievements
were
out
of
doors
upon
the
face
of
the
record
his
chief
legacy
to
thomas
was
an
established
position
in
society
and
the
means
to
maintain
it
but
for
that
alone
he
would
never
have
been
honored
in
his
son
s
memory
as
he
was
thomas
jefferson
did
not
set
that
much
store
on
inherited
privilege
he
may
have
imbibed
certain
democratic
attitudes
from
his
father
for
the
colonel
had
associated
with
crude
men
on
the
frontier
and
in
the
wilderness
and
the
tradition
is
that
he
understood
and
valued
them
this
surveyor
of
boundaries
may
have
been
critical
of
the
group
within
which
he
had
established
himself
more
firmly
than
any
of
his
ancestors
had
done
his
son
in
thoughtful
maturity
was
not
at
all
displeased
by
memories
of
his
indifference
to
social
trappings
but
peter
jefferson
exemplified
the
qualities
of
the
ruling
group
which
were
really
vital
from
his
career
his
heir
might
have
observed
that
the
aristocracy
of
virginia
had
not
yet
grown
old
that
it
was
still
close
to
the
soil
from
which
it
sprang
that
it
continued
to
maintain
a
high
sense
of
public
responsibility
this
strong
and
vigorous
man
may
have
been
deficient
in
the
refinements
but
he
embodied
the
fundamental
qualities
which
enabled
this
society
to
endure
for
all
his
lack
of
book
learning
he
deeply
appreciated
it
and
it
was
he
more
than
anyone
else
who
caused
his
son
to
be
well
schooled
the
tradition
is
that
his
dying
instruction
was
that
the
boy
should
receive
a
thorough
classical
education
and
thomas
himself
said
that
he
was
more
grateful
for
this
than
for
all
the
other
privileges
which
his
father
s
care
had
placed
within
his
reach
if
he
had
to
choose
between
his
estate
and
a
liberal
education
he
would
have
taken
the
latter
but
no
choice
was
necessary
for
he
was
given
both
the
road
to
enlightenment
iii
schooldays
in
albermarle
tom
had
no
masculine
companionship
within
the
family
after
the
death
of
his
father
he
had
been
separated
from
the
colonel
much
of
the
time
during
the
past
five
years
and
he
said
relatively
little
about
him
afterwards
but
undoubtedly
he
missed
him
late
in
life
he
said
that
from
the
age
of
fourteen
his
whole
care
and
direction
were
thrown
on
himself
since
he
had
no
relative
or
friend
who
was
qualified
to
advise
or
guide
him
this
was
an
overstatement
the
loss
of
his
father
created
a
chasm
in
his
life
which
remained
unfilled
until
his
years
in
williamsburg
when
he
found
mature
counselors
whom
he
honored
unreservedly
but
in
the
meantime
he
consulted
the
executors
occasionally
and
he
probably
did
not
intend
to
reflect
upon
them
or
upon
his
mother
he
said
much
less
about
jane
randolph
jefferson
however
than
about
his
father
he
acknowledged
that
she
had
an
ancient
pedigree
probably
regarding
this
as
a
more
important
fact
in
his
early
manhood
than
he
did
later
on
various
entries
in
his
financial
records
after
he
became
a
man
reveal
his
solicitude
for
her
welfare
and
his
almost
complete
failure
to
mention
her
name
elsewhere
may
be
attributed
to
his
characteristic
reticence
about
the
women
of
his
family
nevertheless
the
only
remark
he
is
known
to
have
made
about
her
influence
was
negative
and
he
probably
did
not
value
her
counsel
very
highly
at
no
time
in
his
life
did
he
turn
to
women
for
serious
advice
anyway
she
may
have
remembered
and
sometimes
mentioned
to
him
the
parish
in
london
for
which
their
place
had
been
named
perhaps
she
talked
occasionally
of
her
father
s
friends
william
byrd
and
peter
collinson
thus
serving
to
link
her
son
with
the
worlds
of
polite
learning
and
scientific
curiosity
as
a
man
of
science
and
learning
however
he
gained
his
chief
inspiration
elsewhere
he
must
have
inherited
some
of
his
diverse
talent
from
his
mother
but
there
is
no
positive
testimony
about
her
personality
and
she
remains
a
shadowy
figure
the
family
tradition
was
that
she
was
affectionate
cheerful
humorous
and
a
ready
writer
it
has
also
been
supposed
that
she
was
of
more
delicate
mold
than
her
husband
but
almost
the
only
thing
about
her
that
we
can
be
sure
of
is
that
she
had
physical
endurance
beyond
the
average
she
suffered
inevitable
hardships
in
connection
with
successive
moves
she
bore
ten
children
altogether
and
brought
up
eight
of
them
and
she
survived
her
husband
he
was
considerably
older
than
she
but
in
those
days
of
incessant
childbearing
women
were
often
worn
out
a
great
deal
sooner
she
was
thirty
seven
when
peter
died
and
she
lived
nineteen
years
more
remaining
a
widow
longer
than
she
had
been
a
wife
her
death
happened
to
occur
in
the
year
that
her
elder
son
wrote
the
declaration
of
independence
and
the
youngest
of
her
children
the
twins
attained
their
majority
but
she
did
not
live
quite
long
enough
to
rejoice
in
either
of
these
events
because
of
the
death
of
two
infant
boys
at
tuckahoe
daughters
predominated
in
the
household
and
there
was
a
distinct
gap
between
the
five
older
children
and
the
three
younger
who
were
born
after
the
return
to
shadwell
of
the
younger
group
lucy
was
less
than
five
when
her
father
died
and
anna
scott
and
randolph
were
under
two
in
his
teens
tom
probably
had
little
to
do
with
these
babies
and
he
never
found
real
congeniality
with
randolph
the
five
older
children
jane
mary
thomas
elizabeth
and
martha
were
born
within
a
period
of
six
years
and
it
is
no
wonder
that
their
mother
did
not
do
so
well
thereafter
in
this
group
there
was
one
case
of
obvious
inequality
whether
she
exhausted
herself
in
bearing
thomas
or
there
was
some
mishap
in
the
next
delivery
the
child
she
bore
just
after
him
was
subnormal
the
later
story
of
this
unfortunate
girl
can
wait
but
at
least
it
can
be
said
here
that
elizabeth
jefferson
afforded
little
companionship
to
her
well
endowed
brother
less
than
three
years
after
her
father
s
death
the
second
daughter
mary
married
and
left
home
the
dowry
of
two
hundred
pounds
being
duly
paid
to
john
bolling
in
a
history
of
his
family
printed
a
century
later
it
is
said
that
he
was
six
feet
high
and
very
large
and
that
he
cared
little
for
the
ladies
until
he
saw
his
lady
says
this
quaint
record
after
many
sighs
c
he
married
miss
jefferson
daughter
of
that
jefferson
who
with
mr
fry
made
a
map
of
virginia
a
footnote
adds
that
she
was
a
sister
of
the
late
president
of
the
united
states
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
john
bolling
was
living
in
goochland
which
he
afterwards
represented
in
the
house
of
burgesses
and
served
as
sheriff
he
had
a
place
called
fairfield
where
his
young
brother
in
law
appears
to
have
stopped
on
his
way
to
and
from
williamsburg
in
student
days
the
roof
was
leaky
and
the
young
visitor
was
plagued
with
rats
but
john
bolling
was
of
the
gentry
and
ultimately
was
called
colonel
after
he
had
moved
to
chesterfield
mary
jefferson
had
married
well
and
bore
children
profusely
like
her
mother
she
had
ten
thomas
s
sisters
jane
and
martha
meant
more
than
the
others
in
his
life
jane
nearly
three
years
older
than
he
was
his
first
favorite
perhaps
it
was
she
who
first
showed
him
the
virginia
bluebells
in
the
lowlands
along
the
rivanna
and
who
wandered
with
him
through
the
woods
when
the
wild
violets
were
open
it
is
said
that
she
more
than
any
other
member
of
the
family
stimulated
his
boyish
ambitions
and
encouraged
him
in
his
reading
and
his
cultivation
of
music
he
told
his
grandchildren
of
psalm
tunes
she
used
to
sing
to
him
by
that
time
he
was
remembering
scenes
long
past
for
he
was
only
twenty
two
when
she
died
unmarried
and
he
wrote
for
her
a
latin
epitaph
in
the
little
building
in
the
yard
at
tuckahoe
the
older
jefferson
girls
probably
shared
their
brother
s
early
schooling
when
the
family
returned
to
shadwell
however
there
was
a
separation
for
tom
was
either
left
behind
in
goochland
or
was
sent
back
soon
thereafter
in
when
he
was
nine
his
father
placed
him
in
the
latin
school
of
the
reverend
william
douglas
minister
of
st
james
parish
northam
he
boarded
at
the
clergyman
s
house
during
the
school
term
and
remained
under
his
instruction
until
the
year
that
colonel
jefferson
died
there
were
probably
other
pupils
but
not
many
because
of
the
dispersed
population
and
the
lack
of
towns
in
virginia
education
was
on
an
individual
rather
than
a
civic
basis
and
opportunity
was
largely
restricted
to
the
gentry
the
sons
of
the
greater
landowners
had
all
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
that
go
with
private
instruction
the
quality
of
this
instruction
was
often
high
but
it
naturally
varied
with
the
tutors
who
were
available
more
often
than
not
they
were
clergymen
some
of
these
teachers
of
little
groups
of
gentlemen
s
sons
like
donald
robertson
who
taught
james
madison
have
become
moderately
famous
through
the
grateful
comments
of
their
distinguished
pupils
in
this
respect
william
douglas
was
unfortunate
for
jefferson
did
not
speak
well
of
him
he
was
a
scotchman
who
had
come
to
goochland
a
couple
of
years
before
soon
after
his
ordination
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
preferred
graduates
of
oxford
or
cambridge
to
men
who
had
been
bred
in
presbyterianism
and
some
of
the
planters
like
robert
carter
of
nomini
hall
objected
to
the
scottish
accent
in
a
tutor
james
madison
jokingly
remarked
that
the
scottish
french
he
learned
from
robertson
proved
an
embarrassment
thomas
jefferson
started
out
with
the
same
sort
of
french
and
may
have
had
the
same
thought
when
he
first
went
to
paris
but
his
surviving
comments
relate
to
latin
and
greek
which
were
his
major
subjects
in
his
mature
opinion
douglas
knew
little
of
the
one
and
less
of
the
other
much
nearer
home
a
competent
classicist
was
awaiting
him
and
he
probably
became
aware
of
the
limitations
of
the
reverend
william
douglas
after
he
had
begun
to
study
under
the
reverend
james
maury
early
in
when
he
was
fourteen
he
began
to
attend
maury
s
little
school
the
clergyman
was
then
forty
years
old
and
for
six
years
had
been
officiating
in
fredericksville
parish
which
now
included
the
part
of
albemarle
lying
north
and
west
of
the
rivanna
maury
regarded
it
as
the
most
extensive
and
inconvenient
parish
in
the
colony
that
was
regularly
served
even
after
he
established
himself
strategically
on
a
pleasant
plantation
beneath
the
southwest
mountains
a
couple
of
miles
from
his
wife
s
uncle
dr
thomas
walker
he
spoke
of
himself
as
leading
a
post
boy
s
life
he
had
three
churches
and
a
chapel
and
was
trying
to
support
a
family
of
eight
children
young
thomas
jefferson
was
soon
called
upon
to
be
one
of
the
baptismal
sponsors
for
the
ninth
child
a
boy
named
abraham
there
were
to
be
others
later
it
was
partly
for
the
instruction
of
his
sons
and
partly
to
supplement
his
income
that
this
man
of
piety
and
learning
set
up
a
small
school
in
a
log
house
on
his
place
tom
boarded
with
the
family
but
went
home
on
saturdays
often
taking
with
him
young
james
maury
who
was
three
years
his
junior
rather
than
matthew
a
prospective
clergyman
nearer
his
age
these
two
were
members
of
what
he
afterwards
called
his
class
this
was
said
to
have
numbered
only
five
and
it
included
a
promising
boy
from
louisa
named
dabney
carr
the
younger
james
maury
pointed
out
many
years
later
the
place
designated
for
a
race
between
tom
jefferson
s
slow
pony
and
dabney
carr
s
swift
horse
tom
had
suggested
that
this
should
occur
on
february
and
not
until
the
last
day
of
the
month
did
the
others
discover
that
they
had
been
taken
in
this
early
jeffersonian
hoax
produced
no
lasting
ill
will
however
the
disappointed
rider
of
the
swift
horse
was
for
a
dozen
years
the
closest
friend
that
the
owner
of
the
slow
pony
had
the
fifth
member
of
the
class
was
probably
john
walker
and
james
madison
afterwards
president
of
the
college
of
william
and
mary
and
the
first
episcopal
bishop
of
virginia
came
to
maury
s
before
long
their
teacher
once
described
these
two
as
being
in
good
order
and
well
conditioned
like
so
many
hogsheads
of
tobacco
the
school
was
a
small
but
important
fount
of
friendship
for
a
score
of
years
thomas
jefferson
was
intimate
with
his
county
neighbor
john
walker
and
though
the
future
bishop
of
virginia
was
six
years
younger
than
he
and
may
not
have
been
actually
a
classmate
they
had
maury
s
school
in
common
and
always
liked
each
other
the
teacher
of
these
boys
had
been
brought
to
virginia
by
his
huguenot
parents
an
intelligent
and
deeply
religious
couple
in
due
course
james
maury
had
attended
the
college
of
william
and
mary
had
served
there
briefly
as
an
usher
in
the
grammar
school
had
gone
to
england
for
holy
orders
and
had
come
to
fredericksville
parish
after
a
rectorship
elsewhere
he
was
to
be
unfortunate
in
many
ways
but
clearly
he
was
no
ordinary
schoolmaster
his
greatest
pupil
attested
to
the
correctness
of
his
classical
scholarship
while
his
clerical
contemporary
the
reverend
jonathan
boucher
commented
particularly
on
his
fine
english
style
it
is
easier
for
us
to
judge
the
latter
accomplishment
than
to
realize
the
former
for
some
sermons
and
letters
of
maury
s
remain
these
reveal
him
as
a
spiritual
intelligent
cultivated
and
observant
man
who
wrote
with
vigor
generally
with
vividness
at
times
and
too
often
with
prolixity
by
the
time
that
thomas
jefferson
began
to
attend
his
school
maury
was
in
bad
health
worn
down
by
his
labors
burdened
with
the
care
of
his
large
and
growing
family
he
was
already
a
harassed
if
not
an
unhappy
man
for
boarding
and
teaching
a
young
gentleman
he
received
twenty
pounds
a
year
in
and
when
john
harvie
paid
him
on
behalf
of
the
jefferson
estate
a
decade
later
when
the
price
of
food
had
risen
and
his
own
children
had
increased
in
number
he
concluded
that
this
was
small
compensation
for
the
additional
expense
to
his
table
the
extraordinary
trouble
to
his
family
and
his
own
labor
and
fatigue
from
this
toilsome
business
accordingly
he
then
increased
his
charge
to
twenty
five
pounds
over
the
protests
of
certain
patrons
some
of
the
planters
in
his
opinion
set
a
higher
value
on
instruction
in
dancing
than
on
the
intellectual
and
spiritual
services
that
he
performed
he
had
no
complaints
against
the
jeffersons
however
and
he
was
not
so
embittered
when
thomas
went
to
school
he
had
not
yet
participated
unsuccessfully
in
the
parsons
cause
during
the
boy
s
first
year
in
the
log
schoolhouse
the
assembly
passed
what
was
called
the
two
penny
act
and
against
this
he
heard
his
teacher
inveigh
in
the
household
like
an
earlier
act
which
maury
had
accepted
as
a
temporary
necessity
it
provided
that
the
clergy
and
certain
public
officials
be
paid
not
in
tobacco
but
in
money
at
a
specified
rate
owing
to
the
shortness
of
the
crop
this
rate
was
considerably
below
the
market
price
of
the
season
and
the
clergy
could
anticipate
a
loss
the
second
act
they
opposed
on
legal
grounds
which
seemed
unassailable
and
upon
one
important
occasion
maury
was
their
standard
bearer
supported
by
an
order
in
council
he
brought
suit
against
his
vestry
for
the
balance
that
appeared
to
be
due
him
and
but
for
patrick
henry
he
might
have
been
successful
the
hanover
county
court
had
no
choice
but
to
rule
in
his
favor
but
the
jury
under
henry
s
spell
awarded
him
damages
of
only
one
penny
this
historic
controversy
culminated
after
jefferson
had
left
maury
s
and
he
did
not
remember
much
about
it
afterwards
however
he
must
have
regretted
the
unpopularity
with
the
laity
which
his
teacher
gained
technically
maury
was
right
for
the
virginia
lawmakers
had
been
overruled
by
the
supreme
british
authorities
on
the
other
hand
he
appeared
to
be
opposing
the
general
interest
and
the
judgment
of
the
assembly
in
his
own
behalf
and
in
the
interest
of
his
class
later
issues
were
thus
foreshadowed
and
on
these
jefferson
was
to
take
a
stand
against
the
clergy
it
is
obvious
that
he
did
not
get
from
maury
his
ideas
about
the
relations
between
church
and
state
nor
did
the
future
advocate
of
religious
freedom
get
from
this
teacher
any
germinal
ideas
about
the
just
treatment
of
dissenters
the
boy
must
have
observed
that
the
rector
of
fredericksville
was
bitterly
intolerant
maury
was
often
critical
of
the
british
government
but
jefferson
unlike
his
friend
john
page
never
regarded
his
tutor
as
the
fountainhead
of
his
whiggish
principles
from
his
first
notable
teacher
jefferson
gained
none
of
his
characteristic
political
principles
or
religious
ideas
he
was
indebted
to
him
however
more
than
to
any
other
man
for
his
training
in
the
classics
after
two
years
in
this
school
he
was
able
to
read
greek
and
roman
authors
in
the
original
and
this
he
continued
to
do
throughout
his
long
life
gratefully
and
properly
he
recognized
his
inadequately
educated
father
as
the
first
cause
but
he
also
said
that
the
acquisition
of
ancient
languages
should
be
the
occupation
of
only
the
early
years
the
deep
and
lasting
impressions
on
his
own
memory
must
have
come
from
days
at
maury
s
school
years
later
he
told
john
adams
that
the
idea
occurred
to
him
in
early
life
that
the
best
clues
to
the
proper
pronunciation
of
the
ancient
languages
were
to
be
obtained
from
modern
greeks
and
italians
there
is
no
authority
for
crediting
this
idea
to
maury
and
it
is
known
that
jefferson
became
acquainted
with
italians
shortly
before
the
revolution
as
for
greek
which
he
regarded
as
the
most
perfect
language
the
pursuance
of
his
idea
had
to
be
left
until
he
went
to
paris
this
lifelong
student
had
a
natural
linguistic
gift
and
he
found
teachers
everywhere
but
maury
was
the
first
important
one
in
a
log
house
below
the
southwest
mountains
he
received
at
an
impressionable
age
personal
instruction
from
a
sound
scholar
who
was
aware
of
the
niceties
of
language
and
the
beauties
of
literature
however
rigid
james
maury
may
have
been
as
a
churchman
his
enthusiasm
for
the
classics
was
discriminating
just
as
that
of
his
most
famous
pupil
was
he
could
hardly
have
doubted
the
indispensability
of
classical
training
for
such
a
pupil
as
thomas
jefferson
who
was
clearly
marked
for
a
profession
and
the
exalted
spheres
of
life
but
he
seriously
questioned
its
utility
for
most
of
the
sons
of
the
gentry
who
had
tried
him
no
little
and
whose
customary
life
he
had
carefully
observed
very
few
of
them
prosecuted
their
studies
as
long
as
their
twentieth
year
he
said
they
commonly
married
very
young
and
were
soon
encumbered
with
families
they
had
to
give
constant
attention
to
the
management
of
their
large
estates
regardless
of
inherited
fortune
it
could
not
be
expected
therefore
that
they
would
have
the
necessary
leisure
and
repose
for
a
pleasurable
or
successful
engagement
in
such
parts
of
literature
as
the
languages
criticism
and
curious
and
deep
researches
into
antiquity
this
was
no
prophecy
of
jefferson
s
career
but
maury
probably
encouraged
him
to
delve
into
modern
literature
as
well
as
ancient
in
the
spirit
of
the
enlightenment
and
he
probably
made
a
distinctive
contribution
to
the
boy
s
education
in
his
emphasis
on
the
mother
tongue
the
minister
described
english
as
a
language
as
copious
and
nervous
as
significant
and
expressive
as
numerous
and
musical
nay
to
my
own
ears
as
enchanting
as
any
that
was
ever
spoken
by
any
of
the
different
families
of
the
earth
for
his
time
and
place
he
had
a
large
library
and
he
must
sometimes
have
given
his
pupil
advice
similar
to
that
he
gave
his
own
son
i
would
recommend
it
to
you
to
reflect
and
remark
on
and
digest
what
you
read
to
enter
into
the
spirit
and
design
of
your
author
to
observe
every
step
he
takes
to
accomplish
his
end
and
to
dwell
on
any
remarkable
beauties
of
diction
justness
or
sublimity
of
sentiment
or
masterly
strokes
of
true
wit
which
may
occur
in
the
course
of
your
reading
jefferson
s
emphasis
was
to
be
more
severely
practical
but
he
himself
afterwards
made
recommendations
not
dissimilar
to
these
upon
occasion
he
added
another
which
he
could
hardly
have
got
here
namely
that
two
words
should
not
be
used
when
one
will
do
from
the
story
of
the
projected
horse
race
it
must
not
be
assumed
that
tom
jefferson
was
restricted
to
a
slow
pony
perhaps
he
did
not
begin
riding
as
soon
as
his
younger
kinsman
john
randolph
of
roanoke
who
is
said
to
have
been
foaled
not
born
but
his
father
doubtless
started
him
early
thomas
regarded
george
washington
as
the
best
horseman
of
the
age
but
he
himself
was
described
in
later
life
as
an
uncommonly
fine
rider
and
the
family
remembered
him
as
a
fearless
one
in
a
country
without
large
settlements
and
where
plantation
seats
were
far
apart
riding
was
not
a
matter
of
occasional
diversion
but
of
daily
necessity
and
good
horsemanship
was
taken
for
granted
among
the
gentry
over
the
red
roads
of
albemarle
which
wandered
so
capriciously
through
the
growing
trees
and
the
fallen
timber
tom
took
many
a
ride
not
for
purposes
of
health
as
in
his
later
life
but
simply
to
go
from
one
place
to
another
however
he
was
not
one
of
those
virginians
described
by
revolutionary
travelers
who
would
go
five
miles
to
catch
a
horse
in
order
to
ride
one
mile
afterwards
on
the
contrary
he
came
to
believe
that
the
taming
of
the
horse
had
resulted
in
the
degeneracy
of
the
human
body
and
he
commended
walking
for
exercise
from
the
time
that
he
began
to
advise
the
young
he
must
have
begun
his
walking
early
tramping
through
the
woods
and
hunting
the
family
preserved
a
story
about
his
first
adventures
as
a
hunts
man
when
he
was
ten
he
was
given
a
gun
by
his
father
and
sent
into
the
forest
alone
in
order
to
develop
self
reliance
the
inexperienced
boy
was
wholly
unsuccessful
at
first
in
his
quest
of
quarry
but
at
length
he
found
a
wild
turkey
caught
in
a
pen
tied
it
to
a
tree
with
his
garter
shot
it
and
brought
it
home
in
triumph
this
may
have
been
at
tuckahoe
but
boyish
hunting
was
in
the
albemarle
tradition
his
grandson
who
claims
never
to
have
worn
hat
or
shoe
until
he
was
ten
used
to
arise
at
dawn
and
tramp
barefoot
through
the
snow
in
quest
of
wild
turkeys
and
long
years
after
jefferson
himself
shot
his
first
bird
he
reported
with
obvious
approval
an
instance
of
even
greater
intrepidity
he
had
this
to
say
of
meriwether
lewis
who
grew
up
here
and
whom
he
sent
across
a
continent
he
was
remarkable
even
in
his
infancy
for
enterprise
boldness
and
discretion
when
only
eight
years
of
age
he
habitually
went
out
in
the
dead
of
night
alone
with
his
dogs
into
the
forest
to
hunt
the
raccoon
and
opossum
which
seeking
their
food
in
the
night
can
then
only
be
taken
in
this
exercise
no
season
or
circumstance
could
obstruct
his
purpose
plunging
through
the
winter
s
snows
and
frozen
streams
in
pursuit
of
his
object
he
himself
may
not
have
showed
such
zeal
as
this
at
any
age
but
from
his
youth
he
was
familiar
with
the
habits
of
the
coons
and
possums
observation
of
plants
and
animals
rather
than
stalking
prey
was
characteristic
of
him
in
his
maturity
and
though
he
continued
to
recommend
hunting
as
an
admirable
form
of
youthful
exercise
and
appears
to
have
engaged
in
it
himself
to
some
degree
there
is
no
reliable
evidence
that
he
was
an
ardent
sportsman
his
father
had
started
him
in
the
school
of
self
reliance
but
when
he
first
began
to
think
he
may
have
concluded
that
nature
should
be
explored
and
not
exploited
accomplishments
were
expected
of
him
as
a
young
gentleman
dancing
which
was
proverbially
popular
was
little
short
of
a
social
necessity
virginians
are
of
genuine
blood
said
philip
fithian
they
will
dance
or
die
during
his
second
year
at
maury
s
his
father
s
executor
john
harvie
made
a
payment
to
mr
inglis
for
teaching
children
mo
to
dance
this
instruction
tom
shared
with
four
of
his
sisters
we
do
not
know
whether
or
not
the
dancing
class
went
from
house
to
house
as
in
westmoreland
thus
permitting
a
better
balance
of
the
sexes
but
before
he
entered
the
raleigh
tavern
he
was
probably
familiar
with
the
minuets
reels
and
country
dances
which
were
so
often
mentioned
by
the
pre
revolutionary
diarists
two
years
before
the
declaration
of
independence
one
of
these
said
any
young
gentleman
travelling
through
the
colony
is
presumed
to
be
acquainted
with
dancing
boxing
playing
the
fiddle
and
small
sword
and
cards
somewhat
less
may
have
been
required
in
the
sixties
but
young
thomas
jefferson
had
another
of
these
accomplishments
besides
dancing
before
he
went
away
to
college
it
is
said
that
while
he
was
still
at
maury
s
his
favorite
indoor
amusement
was
playing
on
the
violin
and
that
he
was
already
proficient
for
his
years
we
have
no
information
about
his
first
music
teacher
but
it
must
have
been
before
he
went
to
williamsburg
and
found
new
opportunities
there
that
he
learned
to
play
in
the
musical
language
of
his
time
this
was
not
by
rote
or
ear
but
by
book
according
to
the
gamut
on
one
of
his
first
trips
toward
the
colonial
capital
he
met
patrick
henry
who
fiddled
by
ear
this
might
be
said
to
sum
up
the
difference
between
them
as
statesmen
also
though
the
younger
man
s
political
ear
afterwards
became
sensitive
jefferson
knew
the
country
fiddle
tunes
which
were
played
at
balls
as
well
as
at
countless
informal
rustic
gatherings
and
he
copied
them
in
his
music
books
also
at
some
time
he
wrote
in
a
copy
of
daniel
purcell
s
psalms
set
full
for
the
organ
or
harpsichord
the
words
of
the
new
version
from
the
metrical
translations
of
tate
and
brady
which
were
gradually
superseding
the
older
psalter
these
were
the
tunes
presumably
that
his
sister
jane
sang
so
often
and
that
he
played
with
her
he
always
preferred
them
to
hymns
and
they
always
recalled
her
presence
what
thomas
looked
like
as
he
neared
seventeen
we
can
only
conjecture
from
the
descriptions
given
of
him
long
afterwards
when
observations
seemed
to
be
worth
recording
he
had
large
hands
and
feet
and
by
this
time
must
have
grown
tall
he
towered
well
over
six
feet
eventually
and
was
very
strong
even
though
never
quite
up
to
his
father
s
standard
his
movements
are
said
to
have
been
rather
awkward
his
hair
was
reddish
in
youth
and
he
freckled
quickly
his
eyes
were
hazel
though
often
described
in
later
years
as
blue
and
judging
by
how
long
he
kept
them
his
teeth
must
have
been
magnificent
he
had
good
health
throughout
most
of
his
life
along
with
comparable
vitality
nobody
ever
claimed
that
he
was
handsome
but
it
was
often
said
after
wards
that
he
looked
benevolent
and
he
always
prized
the
quality
of
good
nature
he
was
thin
skinned
however
and
for
many
years
had
to
overcome
his
native
shyness
he
may
have
been
rather
indifferent
to
clothes
during
his
rustic
period
as
he
was
when
he
started
to
grow
old
but
he
became
fastidious
enough
after
he
began
to
notice
the
girls
in
williamsburg
the
colonial
capital
was
his
finishing
school
of
manners
and
he
did
not
become
a
complete
gentleman
until
after
he
had
begun
to
go
to
the
governor
s
palace
there
iv
at
the
college
in
the
year
thomas
jefferson
emerged
from
the
hills
and
entered
the
college
of
william
and
mary
in
williamsburg
his
future
friend
and
rival
john
adams
was
then
five
years
out
of
harvard
but
alexander
hamilton
in
the
british
west
indies
was
little
beyond
the
toddling
stage
george
washington
whose
advanced
schooling
was
gained
in
indian
warfare
had
married
martha
custis
and
was
farming
at
mount
vernon
hoping
that
his
days
of
campaigning
were
over
sagacious
benjamin
franklin
who
had
picked
up
most
of
his
youthful
learning
in
a
printing
shop
was
in
england
high
in
scientific
favor
and
having
the
time
of
his
life
in
this
same
year
king
george
iii
ascended
the
english
throne
unaware
that
in
the
village
capital
of
the
royal
province
of
virginia
there
was
a
stripling
who
would
one
day
denounce
him
in
immortal
language
up
to
this
time
so
far
as
we
know
the
future
author
of
the
declaration
of
independence
had
written
nothing
suggesting
the
cadences
of
that
historic
document
or
anticipating
his
later
grace
but
he
had
drafted
one
letter
which
has
survived
this
was
an
eager
but
stilted
note
to
john
harvie
proposing
that
he
leave
the
mountains
for
the
college
after
talking
things
over
with
another
executor
colonel
peter
randolph
he
had
soberly
marshaled
his
arguments
to
justify
an
important
step
he
could
continue
his
study
of
the
classics
at
the
college
he
believed
he
could
learn
something
of
mathematics
and
he
could
gain
a
more
universal
acquaintance
there
if
these
reasons
were
insufficient
others
could
have
been
easily
adduced
having
outgrown
maury
s
this
promising
boy
deserved
other
opportunities
and
it
seemed
highly
unlikely
that
he
would
waste
them
he
himself
remarked
that
the
coming
of
company
was
causing
him
to
lose
a
fourth
of
his
time
at
home
he
was
already
impatient
with
encroachment
on
his
precious
hours
and
any
hindrance
to
his
pursuit
of
knowledge
after
a
while
he
talked
a
good
deal
about
going
to
england
but
this
possibility
seems
not
to
have
been
considered
seriously
at
first
if
it
ever
was
his
advisers
were
doubtless
aware
that
there
was
confusion
in
the
college
this
was
to
continue
until
the
revolution
and
to
cause
some
of
the
gentry
to
question
the
propriety
of
sending
their
sons
there
for
moral
improvement
and
the
acquisition
of
sound
learning
on
the
other
hand
there
were
those
who
said
that
education
was
a
good
deal
worse
in
england
and
with
them
the
mature
jefferson
would
have
heartily
agreed
several
virginians
among
them
robert
carter
of
nomini
hall
who
afterwards
fully
redeemed
himself
had
returned
so
inconceivably
illiterate
and
also
corrupted
and
vicious
that
mann
page
of
rosewell
swore
that
no
son
of
his
should
go
to
school
in
england
accordingly
this
wealthy
planter
sent
his
son
john
to
the
grammar
school
of
william
and
mary
at
the
age
of
thirteen
and
put
him
to
lodge
and
board
with
president
thomas
dawson
who
was
also
commissary
of
the
bishop
of
london
and
minister
of
bruton
church
peter
jefferson
s
son
who
entered
at
a
higher
level
as
he
was
nearing
seventeen
likewise
escaped
foreign
contamination
though
he
gained
no
high
impression
of
the
learning
and
morals
of
the
clergymen
on
the
faculty
during
his
student
days
in
williamsburg
lodging
and
eating
in
the
college
were
not
compulsory
for
paying
scholars
but
the
surviving
records
imply
that
he
did
not
avail
himself
of
the
privilege
of
living
in
town
he
began
to
pay
board
on
march
and
continued
to
do
so
for
two
years
and
one
month
then
so
far
as
the
records
show
his
college
career
was
over
about
this
time
the
faculty
were
forced
to
enjoin
the
housekeeper
to
serve
both
fresh
and
salt
meat
for
dinner
to
provide
puddings
and
pies
on
sunday
and
two
weekdays
and
to
see
that
the
suppers
were
not
made
up
of
different
sorts
of
scraps
but
were
the
same
for
every
table
the
chief
complaint
came
after
jefferson
had
left
the
college
but
like
the
other
boys
he
probably
suffered
from
the
negligence
of
a
housekeeper
who
was
away
too
often
a
year
or
more
after
his
departure
she
was
away
for
good
the
main
building
then
more
than
sixty
years
old
was
generally
termed
the
college
though
there
was
also
the
brafferton
where
a
handful
of
indians
stayed
opposite
this
stood
the
president
s
house
some
twenty
years
after
his
student
days
jefferson
described
the
college
and
the
hospital
in
williamsburg
as
rude
mis
shapen
piles
which
but
that
they
have
roofs
would
be
taken
for
brick
kilns
this
however
was
after
he
had
fallen
under
the
spell
of
palladio
his
architectural
judgment
could
hardly
have
been
that
severe
when
he
was
a
youth
fresh
from
the
frame
buildings
of
albemarle
at
a
later
time
he
also
condemned
the
educational
organization
of
the
college
and
tried
to
improve
it
the
statutes
had
been
revised
a
couple
of
years
before
he
entered
but
in
framework
the
college
was
essentially
unchanged
from
until
he
became
governor
of
virginia
half
a
century
later
it
consisted
of
the
grammar
school
which
was
preparatory
the
indian
school
which
a
few
redskins
still
attended
the
philosophy
school
in
which
he
himself
was
enrolled
and
the
divinity
school
which
he
afterwards
helped
to
abolish
two
professors
were
assigned
to
each
of
the
two
latter
and
each
of
the
former
had
a
single
master
with
the
president
the
entire
faculty
consisted
of
seven
men
and
there
were
probably
not
more
than
a
hundred
scholars
and
students
altogether
with
the
single
but
important
exception
of
william
small
professor
of
natural
philosophy
the
members
of
the
william
and
mary
faculty
were
anglican
clergymen
and
for
half
a
dozen
years
they
had
been
embroiled
in
controversy
with
the
local
political
authorities
two
years
before
jefferson
enrolled
there
had
been
an
upheaval
and
it
was
as
a
result
of
this
that
small
had
come
to
the
college
because
of
their
activities
against
the
two
penny
act
which
as
we
have
seen
affected
the
pay
of
the
clergy
unfavorably
three
of
the
professors
had
been
dismissed
by
the
local
governing
body
the
board
of
visitors
one
of
these
men
died
but
the
two
others
appealed
to
england
for
reinstatement
and
after
jefferson
had
left
the
college
won
their
fight
this
proved
bad
for
small
when
jefferson
arrived
on
the
scene
however
he
was
there
teaching
physics
metaphysics
and
mathematics
and
through
force
of
circumstances
was
soon
teaching
practically
everything
else
jefferson
s
other
teacher
at
first
was
the
reverend
jacob
rowe
professor
of
moral
philosophy
whose
field
comprised
rhetoric
logic
and
ethics
in
the
august
of
jefferson
s
first
year
which
had
begun
in
late
march
and
was
interrupted
by
no
long
summer
vacation
rowe
and
the
master
of
the
grammar
school
became
far
too
merry
and
led
the
college
boys
in
a
row
with
the
boys
of
the
town
consequently
one
of
these
clergymen
was
summarily
dismissed
and
the
other
resigned
the
immediate
results
were
favorable
to
jefferson
almost
a
year
passed
before
a
successor
to
the
deposed
professor
of
moral
philosophy
was
installed
and
in
the
interim
small
added
all
or
many
of
rowe
s
subjects
to
his
own
he
was
already
giving
jefferson
his
first
views
of
the
expansion
of
science
and
according
to
this
eminent
pupil
he
gave
the
first
lectures
ever
delivered
in
the
college
in
ethics
rhetoric
and
belles
lettres
either
these
subjects
had
been
previously
sacrificed
to
logic
or
they
had
been
taught
more
mechanically
by
men
who
lacked
small
s
happy
talent
of
communication
for
nearly
half
of
jefferson
s
course
small
appears
to
have
been
the
only
regular
teacher
that
he
had
whatever
may
be
thought
about
the
organization
administration
and
discipline
of
the
college
here
was
one
of
those
rare
personal
influences
which
prove
unforgettable
and
elicit
immortal
tribute
he
afterwards
said
that
small
probably
fixed
the
destinies
of
his
life
but
for
small
the
first
year
must
have
been
deeply
disillusioning
to
him
in
the
midst
of
all
the
woes
created
by
convivial
and
riotous
members
of
the
faculty
president
dawson
himself
began
to
drink
notoriously
and
when
arraigned
before
the
board
of
visitors
on
the
charge
of
habitual
drunkenness
confessed
the
fact
his
friend
lieutenant
governor
fauquier
defended
him
saying
that
he
had
been
teased
by
contrariety
of
opinions
between
him
and
the
clergy
into
the
loss
of
his
spirits
and
it
was
no
wonder
that
he
should
apply
for
consolation
to
spirituous
liquors
he
was
granted
a
pardon
on
the
promise
of
future
sobriety
but
the
unfortunate
man
became
quite
irresponsible
he
died
in
december
not
until
spring
did
the
reverend
william
yates
from
whose
arid
teaching
john
page
had
suffered
elsewhere
qualify
as
his
successor
he
also
became
minister
of
bruton
church
which
jefferson
attended
sitting
near
the
pulpit
in
the
half
of
the
south
gallery
which
was
assigned
to
the
college
the
scandals
and
confusion
which
the
youth
observed
in
his
first
year
must
have
made
a
deep
impression
on
so
sensitive
a
mind
but
at
this
immature
age
he
was
not
deeply
interested
in
the
continuing
struggle
between
the
clerical
faculty
and
the
local
governing
board
the
fundamental
question
was
whether
the
bishop
of
london
or
the
gentlemen
of
virginia
should
have
final
authority
over
the
college
and
the
church
and
the
gentry
would
have
given
the
same
answer
to
this
if
thomas
jefferson
had
never
gone
to
school
in
williamsburg
his
later
distinction
among
his
fellows
was
owing
to
his
championship
not
merely
of
local
self
government
but
of
complete
religious
liberty
the
seeds
of
anticlericalism
however
were
probably
sown
in
his
mind
while
he
was
in
college
or
soon
afterwards
when
he
became
intimate
with
francis
fauquier
he
could
hardly
have
failed
to
learn
that
the
relations
between
the
brilliant
governor
and
the
local
representatives
of
english
ecclesiasticism
were
far
from
amicable
and
on
personal
grounds
his
sympathies
may
have
been
enlisted
against
the
clergy
it
is
a
highly
significant
fact
also
that
the
early
teacher
who
did
most
to
fix
the
destinies
of
his
life
was
the
only
layman
in
the
faculty
of
the
college
the
surviving
record
of
this
influential
layman
is
all
too
brief
he
was
a
scotchman
designated
as
mr
william
small
when
he
was
appointed
in
he
remained
in
williamsburg
six
years
returned
to
england
where
he
is
said
to
have
been
the
friend
of
james
watt
and
erasmus
darwin
and
died
at
birmingham
in
listed
as
william
small
m
d
he
had
assumed
the
title
after
he
left
virginia
the
circumstances
of
his
going
were
unpleasant
his
predecessor
as
professor
of
natural
philosophy
was
successful
in
his
appeal
to
england
and
had
to
be
restored
small
had
been
sent
over
by
the
bishop
of
london
in
the
first
place
but
he
had
less
reason
than
his
clerical
colleagues
to
rely
on
english
ecclesiastical
authority
and
during
his
stay
in
the
colony
he
was
on
more
friendly
terms
than
the
others
with
the
local
political
group
it
was
a
sign
of
the
approval
of
the
board
of
visitors
that
they
proceeded
to
elect
him
to
the
chair
of
moral
philosophy
which
was
again
vacant
after
he
had
lost
the
professorship
of
natural
philosophy
at
the
same
time
however
the
board
passed
a
statute
affirming
the
right
to
remove
any
member
of
the
faculty
at
will
small
balked
at
agreeing
to
that
went
to
england
to
look
into
the
matter
further
and
declined
to
return
there
were
some
other
matters
of
disagreement
and
in
the
end
he
aroused
the
strong
displeasure
of
the
presiding
officer
of
the
board
who
wrote
him
a
sarcastic
letter
at
some
time
jefferson
probably
learned
about
all
this
and
he
may
have
reflected
that
local
authority
itself
is
likely
to
become
tyrannical
what
he
learned
from
his
favorite
teacher
was
not
obedience
to
authority
but
delight
in
the
exercise
of
his
mind
john
page
in
the
last
year
of
his
own
life
referred
to
this
same
teacher
as
illustrious
and
credited
to
him
the
beginnings
of
his
own
abiding
interest
in
all
branches
of
mathematics
shortly
after
small
left
the
college
jefferson
was
probably
thinking
of
him
when
he
described
the
study
of
mathematics
and
natural
philosophy
as
peculiarly
engaging
and
delightful
he
certainly
was
when
he
took
up
mathematics
again
long
afterwards
in
order
to
guide
his
grandson
s
course
and
endeavored
to
rub
off
the
dust
of
fifty
years
it
was
always
his
favorite
subject
he
said
we
have
no
theories
there
no
uncertainties
remain
on
the
mind
all
is
demonstration
and
satisfaction
i
have
forgotten
much
and
recover
it
with
more
difficulty
than
when
in
the
vigor
of
my
mind
i
originally
acquired
it
but
as
he
soon
wrote
to
another
thanks
to
the
good
foundation
laid
at
college
by
my
old
master
and
friend
small
i
am
doing
it
with
a
delight
and
success
beyond
my
expectation
jefferson
observed
that
small
pursued
an
even
and
dignified
line
of
conduct
like
others
whom
he
particularly
emulated
in
those
crucial
days
this
layman
was
not
one
to
be
involved
in
student
brawls
on
the
other
hand
in
an
era
of
disorder
he
alone
of
the
faculty
denied
the
arbitrary
power
of
a
master
to
inflict
punishment
on
an
offending
scholar
john
page
called
him
his
ever
to
be
beloved
professor
and
jefferson
said
that
he
gave
to
his
studies
enlightened
and
affectionate
guidance
and
was
like
a
father
to
him
actually
this
unmarried
teacher
whose
chief
complaint
about
his
position
was
its
loneliness
made
a
daily
companion
of
young
jefferson
and
taught
him
no
less
through
informal
talk
than
by
his
memorable
lectures
as
a
mature
man
jefferson
did
not
forget
him
just
when
the
revolution
was
beginning
and
public
dissension
threatened
to
divide
him
from
his
friend
as
the
ocean
had
already
done
he
sent
him
by
a
reluctant
captain
what
he
described
as
half
of
a
little
present
that
he
had
laid
by
it
consisted
of
three
dozen
bottles
of
madeira
which
he
had
kept
for
eight
years
in
his
own
cellar
and
he
promised
to
dispatch
that
many
more
as
soon
as
possible
by
another
ship
he
did
not
know
that
his
old
teacher
was
in
the
last
year
of
life
there
is
some
testimony
that
small
s
influence
persisted
in
the
college
it
has
been
said
that
he
more
than
any
other
teacher
was
responsible
for
the
liberality
of
spirit
which
came
to
characterize
william
and
mary
some
people
called
it
skepticism
and
thought
it
dangerous
but
jefferson
and
his
kindred
spirits
regarded
it
as
the
first
step
towards
true
knowledge
historically
william
small
was
a
minor
torchbearer
of
the
enlightenment
and
by
any
reckoning
he
was
one
of
those
rare
men
who
point
the
way
who
show
new
paths
who
open
doors
before
the
mind
to
jefferson
he
also
opened
the
door
of
george
wythe
s
law
office
and
he
and
wythe
ushered
this
inquiring
young
man
into
the
governor
s
palace
thus
were
the
benefits
of
enlightened
conversation
increased
rather
than
diminished
after
jefferson
left
the
college
he
was
as
intimate
with
small
for
two
more
years
as
one
of
his
age
could
be
his
life
and
associations
in
williamsburg
before
he
was
admitted
to
the
bar
cannot
be
divided
into
sharply
defined
segments
but
if
his
college
course
can
be
described
separately
it
is
best
summed
up
by
saying
that
he
continued
to
be
taught
privately
and
that
his
tutor
was
william
small
the
same
sort
of
statement
can
be
made
about
the
five
years
after
that
when
he
studied
law
under
george
wythe
he
gained
clear
title
to
fame
in
later
years
as
a
prophet
and
architect
of
public
education
but
his
own
training
was
pre
eminently
personal
and
private
self
imposed
rather
than
external
discipline
shaped
his
education
from
his
youth
onward
in
his
last
decade
he
wrote
i
was
a
hard
student
until
i
entered
on
the
business
of
life
the
duties
of
which
leave
no
idle
time
to
those
disposed
to
fulfil
them
and
now
retired
and
at
the
age
of
seventy
six
i
am
again
a
hard
student
the
first
period
of
his
amazing
life
differed
in
many
ways
from
the
important
and
exacting
era
of
public
service
which
followed
but
the
habit
of
study
persisted
drafting
state
papers
brought
him
no
such
joy
as
the
free
pursuit
of
knowledge
and
he
could
not
approach
all
public
problems
with
the
zeal
of
the
explorer
but
in
all
his
tasks
he
could
and
did
manifest
the
seriousness
and
the
industry
of
the
scholar
his
characteristic
habits
of
study
may
have
been
formed
even
before
he
went
to
williamsburg
said
one
of
his
young
admirers
who
observed
him
when
he
was
ripe
in
years
and
honors
his
mind
must
have
been
by
nature
one
of
uncommon
capaciousness
and
retention
of
wonderful
clearness
and
as
rapid
as
is
consistent
with
accurate
thoughts
his
application
from
very
early
youth
has
not
only
been
intense
but
unremitted
when
young
he
adopted
a
system
perhaps
an
entire
plan
of
life
from
which
neither
the
exigencies
of
business
nor
the
allurements
of
pleasure
could
drive
or
seduce
him
much
of
his
success
is
to
be
ascribed
to
methodical
industry
even
when
at
school
he
used
to
be
seen
with
his
greek
grammar
in
his
hand
while
his
comrades
were
enjoying
relaxation
in
the
interval
of
school
hours
the
family
tradition
is
that
during
his
college
days
he
studied
fifteen
hours
of
twenty
four
and
habitually
until
long
past
midnight
only
to
rise
at
dawn
this
sounds
like
too
severe
a
program
even
for
him
in
vacations
he
is
said
to
have
devoted
almost
three
fourths
of
his
time
to
his
books
next
only
to
tyranny
he
hated
indolence
which
he
regarded
as
the
besetting
sin
of
his
hospitable
virginia
countrymen
and
about
which
he
wrote
with
appalling
frequency
to
his
children
in
later
years
it
is
while
we
are
young
that
the
habit
of
industry
is
formed
he
reflected
if
not
then
it
never
is
afterwards
if
this
is
true
he
himself
formed
the
habit
early
determine
never
to
be
idle
he
admonished
his
growing
daughter
no
person
will
have
occasion
to
complain
of
the
want
of
time
who
never
loses
any
then
he
made
an
observation
which
aptly
sums
up
his
own
intellectual
history
it
is
wonderful
how
much
may
be
done
if
we
are
always
doing
such
a
regimen
and
such
a
philosophy
would
impose
a
strain
on
any
but
the
strongest
physique
he
learned
to
guard
his
unusual
natural
gifts
by
physical
regularity
and
systematic
exercise
though
we
cannot
be
sure
just
when
he
became
so
wise
he
ran
and
walked
when
in
college
and
if
the
testimony
of
his
grandson
can
be
accepted
he
once
swam
thirteen
times
across
a
millpond
that
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
this
seems
too
much
for
a
boy
fresh
from
the
little
rivanna
but
the
physical
endurance
of
peter
jefferson
s
heir
was
remarkable
in
his
youth
and
prime
it
was
probably
in
williamsburg
that
he
established
the
habit
of
bathing
his
feet
in
cold
water
every
morning
this
practice
he
continued
for
upwards
of
sixty
years
and
to
it
he
attributed
his
lifelong
freedom
from
colds
at
seventy
six
he
reported
that
only
two
or
three
times
in
his
life
had
he
had
a
fever
of
more
than
twenty
four
hours
and
he
then
could
boast
that
he
had
been
blessed
with
organs
of
digestion
which
accept
and
concoct
without
ever
murmuring
whatever
the
palate
chooses
to
consign
to
them
and
that
he
had
not
lost
a
tooth
by
age
the
severe
perfection
of
this
portrait
is
somewhat
relieved
by
his
own
statement
that
during
his
early
years
in
williamsburg
he
was
extravagant
by
occasional
remarks
of
his
about
youthful
temptations
and
by
other
indications
of
gaiety
and
frivolity
the
most
frivolous
period
probably
coincided
with
the
first
years
that
he
studied
law
when
he
grumbled
about
his
law
books
and
indulged
in
much
silly
chatter
about
the
girls
he
participated
in
the
annual
battles
between
town
and
gown
but
there
is
no
suggestion
that
he
was
ever
disciplined
for
his
part
in
student
scrapes
as
was
his
friend
john
walker
who
was
rusticated
in
the
fall
of
along
with
a
couple
of
other
boys
who
afterwards
gained
considerable
renown
he
had
left
the
college
then
and
was
living
in
town
but
he
reported
the
episode
with
some
zest
he
was
a
member
of
a
student
organization
known
as
the
flat
hat
club
which
is
notable
for
its
primacy
as
a
secret
college
society
but
wholly
lacked
seriousness
of
purpose
it
is
not
to
be
confused
with
phi
beta
kappa
of
which
jefferson
knew
nothing
it
was
primarily
convivial
and
its
certificates
of
membership
were
couched
in
humorous
latin
phraseology
one
of
its
expressed
desires
was
that
each
member
should
be
a
great
ornament
and
pillar
of
things
general
and
particular
john
walker
was
a
fellow
member
and
the
fact
that
there
were
only
six
altogether
may
or
may
not
imply
that
jefferson
was
numbered
among
the
socially
elite
he
continued
to
attend
meetings
after
he
left
college
and
wrote
about
one
of
them
in
frivolous
latin
vein
john
page
said
that
jefferson
could
tear
himself
away
from
his
dearest
friends
to
fly
to
his
studies
it
seems
likely
that
he
did
not
cultivate
the
fine
art
of
friendship
consciously
and
assiduously
until
after
he
became
somewhat
discouraged
about
the
girls
but
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
he
flouted
the
dominant
tradition
of
sociability
or
that
he
failed
to
avail
himself
of
the
great
opportunities
for
friendship
which
this
small
academic
community
afforded
some
of
his
most
enduring
associations
started
there
one
of
the
distinguishing
characteristics
of
colonial
williamsburg
was
the
seasonal
occasion
for
friendly
intercourse
which
it
offered
to
residents
of
isolated
plantations
in
the
midst
of
this
sociable
village
which
teemed
periodically
the
college
was
set
its
junior
members
were
drawn
from
the
sons
of
the
gentry
and
these
constituted
a
close
knit
group
there
were
gradations
of
rank
among
them
with
the
families
of
the
councillors
at
the
top
of
the
social
scale
but
there
was
no
such
invidious
distinction
here
as
john
adams
found
at
harvard
college
where
seats
in
class
were
assigned
according
to
parental
rank
or
standing
the
son
of
a
rugged
squire
from
the
piedmont
did
not
have
to
take
a
lower
place
than
john
page
of
rosewell
with
this
particular
scion
of
a
highly
influential
family
jefferson
was
intimate
from
the
start
and
through
him
became
friends
with
the
equally
aristocratic
nelsons
his
old
schoolmate
at
maury
s
dabney
carr
may
not
have
entered
until
the
year
after
he
did
with
this
single
exception
page
was
jefferson
s
closest
college
friend
the
two
were
almost
exactly
the
same
age
and
they
were
to
be
like
brothers
for
almost
half
a
century
page
had
the
more
impressive
economic
and
social
background
through
his
grandmother
he
was
a
descendant
of
king
carter
and
his
grandfather
mann
page
had
been
a
much
larger
landholder
than
the
second
thomas
jefferson
or
even
isham
randolph
besides
being
a
member
of
the
council
it
was
this
mann
page
who
had
built
rosewell
in
gloucester
county
and
left
the
fabulous
house
to
a
son
of
the
same
name
who
spent
most
of
his
strength
bearing
the
heavy
burden
in
this
huge
three
storied
mansion
john
had
grown
up
jefferson
was
often
to
look
at
its
mahogany
wainscoting
and
climb
its
marble
stairways
probably
reflecting
that
his
own
forebears
had
been
wise
in
not
cultivating
magnificence
so
extravagantly
to
a
greater
degree
than
jefferson
s
immediate
ancestors
the
pages
were
devoted
to
the
church
and
associated
with
the
college
but
john
may
have
been
removed
from
the
president
s
house
at
the
time
that
poor
dawson
got
into
so
much
trouble
and
before
the
reverend
william
yates
came
in
he
appears
to
have
lodged
in
the
college
during
the
second
year
that
his
friend
from
albemarle
was
there
and
he
may
have
been
with
him
from
the
first
he
had
secured
a
firm
grounding
in
the
classics
from
his
revered
tutor
william
price
and
like
jefferson
he
enjoyed
the
special
attentions
of
william
small
both
small
and
president
dawson
commended
him
to
governor
fauquier
in
religious
matters
he
was
more
conventional
than
jefferson
and
being
especially
sociable
he
was
more
willing
to
leave
his
books
there
was
no
touch
of
genius
on
him
but
he
was
every
inch
a
gentleman
he
was
a
fellow
in
philosophical
inquiry
until
his
boon
companion
probed
more
deeply
and
he
was
an
intimate
confidant
in
early
matters
of
the
heart
since
jefferson
remained
so
long
in
williamsburg
as
a
student
it
may
be
safely
assumed
that
he
knew
practically
everybody
who
attended
the
college
from
to
among
his
near
contemporaries
were
these
john
walker
who
was
destined
to
be
a
fellow
burgess
from
albemarle
william
fleming
to
whom
some
of
his
earliest
known
letters
were
directed
francis
eppes
to
whom
he
was
to
be
closely
bound
by
marriage
a
couple
of
harrisons
for
one
of
whom
he
may
later
have
designed
brandon
john
tyler
with
whom
he
was
to
be
associated
as
a
law
student
austin
and
bernard
moore
to
one
of
whom
he
was
to
address
a
memorable
letter
about
the
study
of
law
jacquelin
ambler
who
was
to
win
a
girl
he
dreamed
of
and
bathurst
skelton
whose
widow
he
was
to
marry
later
on
some
of
these
names
are
now
remembered
chiefly
because
of
their
association
with
his
he
overtopped
his
own
college
generation
but
even
among
its
members
he
met
future
leaders
of
the
colony
and
state
thomas
nelson
junior
who
was
to
succeed
him
as
governor
in
perilous
times
had
gone
to
school
abroad
but
was
much
in
williamsburg
in
this
period
a
more
noted
group
came
to
the
college
somewhat
later
edmund
randolph
john
taylor
of
caroline
and
that
james
madison
who
became
a
bishop
and
early
in
the
next
decade
appeared
john
marshall
briefly
and
james
monroe
the
james
madison
who
was
to
succeed
jefferson
as
president
manifested
a
degree
of
unconventionality
by
attending
the
college
of
new
jersey
at
princeton
but
even
without
him
this
is
an
exceedingly
distinguished
list
to
those
who
heard
of
the
recurrent
disorders
among
the
students
at
william
and
mary
and
of
the
dissensions
within
the
faculty
or
between
the
faculty
and
the
board
the
affairs
of
this
historic
college
may
well
have
seemed
chaotic
during
the
period
that
jefferson
knew
it
best
the
successor
to
president
dawson
as
commissary
of
the
bishop
of
london
the
reverend
william
robinson
thought
that
it
had
failed
to
answer
the
high
ends
of
its
institution
and
doubted
if
under
existing
conditions
learning
and
religion
would
strike
deep
root
in
the
colony
he
proposed
that
the
college
be
really
put
under
the
care
of
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
in
england
and
be
entirely
divorced
from
local
control
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
situation
was
anomalous
but
the
school
was
more
successful
than
he
realized
the
secret
of
its
success
lay
not
in
its
organization
not
in
its
identification
with
the
english
church
not
even
in
its
faculty
but
in
its
intimate
association
with
the
community
in
which
it
was
placed
the
college
could
be
no
mere
training
school
for
clergymen
though
actually
it
produced
better
ministers
for
the
colony
than
those
who
were
imported
directly
from
abroad
the
gentry
had
no
strong
desire
that
it
cultivate
learning
for
its
own
sake
for
their
ideal
was
the
well
rounded
man
it
was
pre
eminently
a
school
for
statesmen
and
as
such
on
the
north
american
continent
its
product
has
never
been
excelled
the
extraordinary
distinction
of
its
alumni
is
chiefly
owing
to
the
fact
that
its
students
were
by
birth
and
station
the
potential
leaders
of
the
colony
and
that
their
college
days
were
spent
at
the
center
of
provincial
life
the
most
important
fact
about
it
was
not
that
it
was
relatively
old
or
that
it
had
considerable
resources
but
that
it
was
located
in
williamsburg
in
this
distinctive
community
jefferson
as
a
young
man
met
the
leading
gentlemen
of
the
country
and
there
before
he
was
grown
he
saw
visitors
of
quite
a
different
sort
the
indians
were
in
the
habit
of
coming
to
the
capital
often
in
great
numbers
and
he
reports
that
he
was
much
with
them
one
historic
visit
occurred
in
the
spring
of
and
with
brief
mention
of
it
we
can
end
the
story
of
his
college
days
it
was
that
of
a
cherokee
chief
whom
he
had
seen
before
as
the
guest
of
his
father
at
shadwell
on
previous
journeys
and
he
called
him
ontassete
though
there
were
other
names
for
the
same
man
ostenaco
oconasta
judd
s
friend
and
best
of
all
perhaps
outacity
a
party
of
at
least
indians
had
set
out
from
the
holston
country
in
what
is
now
east
tennessee
and
an
embarrassingly
large
number
eventually
arrived
in
williamsburg
the
students
must
have
talked
about
them
and
they
may
have
observed
outacity
when
he
was
dined
at
the
college
they
doubtless
heard
that
he
was
received
by
the
governor
and
council
and
granted
permission
to
visit
the
great
king
his
father
in
england
they
could
hardly
have
anticipated
the
sensation
which
the
cherokee
created
in
london
where
he
was
visited
by
oliver
goldsmith
and
painted
by
sir
joshua
reynolds
but
before
his
departure
he
made
a
profound
impression
on
a
youth
who
was
nearing
nineteen
and
who
had
not
yet
crossed
the
sea
jefferson
was
in
outacity
s
camp
when
he
delivered
a
farewell
oration
to
his
people
the
evening
before
he
sailed
and
as
an
old
man
he
remembered
the
splendor
of
the
moon
the
college
student
understood
no
word
of
the
chief
s
prayer
for
his
own
safety
on
the
voyage
and
for
that
of
his
people
until
his
return
but
outacity
s
resounding
voice
and
the
solemn
silence
of
his
followers
around
their
campfires
filled
him
with
awe
and
veneration
years
afterward
as
governor
and
president
he
was
to
receive
visits
from
indians
to
address
them
as
a
father
and
to
smoke
with
them
the
pipe
of
peace
he
was
to
observe
this
race
as
a
philosopher
and
to
in
quire
into
its
languages
as
a
responsible
statesman
he
was
to
grapple
with
the
problem
of
depredations
and
massacres
on
the
frontier
but
he
was
not
soon
if
ever
to
escape
from
these
early
emotions
at
this
time
unquestionably
he
was
moved
not
by
fear
but
by
curiosity
and
compassion
nonetheless
these
warriors
must
have
reminded
him
that
the
wilderness
was
not
far
away
from
the
college
halls
he
was
quitting
from
the
capitol
where
decorous
statesmen
deliberated
from
the
palace
ballroom
where
ladies
and
gentlemen
danced
the
gay
reel
and
the
stately
minuet
of
such
contrasts
was
provincial
life
compounded
v
williamsburg
introduction
to
the
law
when
jefferson
first
went
to
williamsburg
as
a
student
it
is
most
unlikely
that
he
had
ever
seen
that
large
a
town
in
virginia
both
norfolk
and
petersburg
were
larger
though
neither
of
these
was
impressive
in
its
size
the
major
reason
for
the
failure
to
develop
commercial
centers
in
virginia
he
himself
set
forth
a
good
many
years
after
he
left
college
our
country
being
much
intersected
with
navigable
waters
and
trade
brought
generally
to
our
doors
instead
of
our
being
obliged
to
go
in
quest
of
it
has
probably
been
one
of
the
causes
why
we
have
no
towns
of
any
consequence
important
business
was
transacted
in
williamsburg
but
the
place
would
never
have
become
famous
because
of
that
legally
it
was
a
city
and
had
been
laid
out
on
a
pleasing
plan
but
it
covered
only
a
square
mile
and
had
fewer
than
two
thousand
people
except
during
public
times
in
the
fall
and
spring
when
the
courts
sat
and
the
assembly
was
generally
in
session
its
population
was
doubled
or
trebled
then
everybody
of
political
consequence
in
the
colony
was
there
and
the
three
hundred
houses
with
the
neighboring
plantation
seats
were
filled
to
overflowing
sometimes
there
were
half
a
dozen
guests
in
a
single
room
from
the
open
space
in
front
of
the
college
between
the
president
s
house
and
the
brafferton
jefferson
and
the
other
students
must
often
have
looked
down
the
noble
great
street
to
the
capitol
almost
a
mile
away
before
his
father
was
born
the
width
of
this
central
thoroughfare
had
been
fixed
at
six
poles
or
to
all
practical
purposes
a
hundred
feet
and
afterwards
it
was
named
for
the
duke
of
gloucester
in
public
times
an
incessant
train
of
coaches
could
be
seen
plowing
their
way
through
the
powdered
oyster
shells
which
looked
like
sand
or
through
seas
of
mud
depending
on
the
weather
walking
was
unpleasant
at
certain
seasons
because
of
the
dust
or
the
mud
and
virginians
generally
preferred
to
ride
but
often
in
his
student
days
jefferson
must
have
stretched
his
long
legs
on
the
duke
of
gloucester
street
before
he
reached
bruton
church
where
at
times
he
listened
to
the
arid
preaching
of
the
era
he
passed
the
home
of
the
honorable
john
blair
president
of
the
council
at
an
early
date
two
daughters
of
this
prominent
family
anne
and
betsey
became
his
friends
they
lived
in
a
pleasant
white
house
with
dormer
windows
a
high
pitched
roof
and
outside
chimneys
at
the
ends
it
was
set
close
to
the
sidewalk
in
conformity
with
the
building
laws
and
on
summer
nights
the
family
and
their
guests
used
to
sit
on
the
steps
and
sing
on
this
street
gardens
had
to
be
behind
the
houses
but
greens
and
other
open
spaces
had
been
left
to
permit
free
circulation
of
the
air
the
brick
church
was
almost
at
the
halfway
point
and
stood
at
the
intersection
of
the
palace
green
considerably
beyond
this
was
the
printing
office
of
the
virginia
gazette
people
often
went
there
to
insert
notices
about
runaways
to
advertise
the
sale
of
parcels
of
likely
virginia
born
wenches
or
to
offer
to
the
horse
breeding
public
the
services
of
stallions
in
their
prime
when
jefferson
stopped
there
however
it
was
generally
to
purchase
books
and
music
farther
down
the
street
was
a
tavern
which
had
been
named
for
sir
walter
raleigh
and
was
shaped
like
the
letter
l
it
was
to
gain
greatest
renown
in
revolutionary
times
but
its
famous
apollo
room
was
already
in
use
jefferson
danced
in
it
before
he
ever
deliberated
at
the
same
place
on
affairs
of
state
having
proceeded
so
far
one
might
easily
go
on
a
little
farther
to
the
capitol
at
the
end
of
this
broad
street
there
peter
jefferson
had
done
brief
service
as
a
burgess
but
his
son
could
not
see
the
chamber
where
isham
randolph
had
taken
oath
at
an
earlier
time
for
this
was
a
fairly
new
building
erected
after
a
fire
jefferson
later
described
it
as
a
light
and
airy
structure
with
a
portico
in
front
of
two
orders
he
rather
liked
the
doric
columns
while
disapproving
of
the
proportions
of
the
ionic
and
thought
this
the
most
pleasing
bit
of
architecture
in
virginia
on
the
whole
it
can
be
seen
no
longer
for
the
last
part
of
it
burned
after
jefferson
was
dead
and
it
was
not
restored
near
the
capitol
in
the
s
as
now
was
the
public
gaol
and
beyond
the
capitol
he
could
have
come
into
still
another
world
here
was
an
open
space
known
as
the
exchange
where
planters
squared
accounts
with
one
another
consigned
tobacco
to
factors
and
sea
captains
and
arranged
to
purchase
negro
fellows
or
some
of
those
likely
wenches
here
was
the
coffee
house
which
jefferson
frequented
as
a
young
man
here
was
the
second
williamsburg
theater
where
he
like
george
washington
purchased
tickets
for
the
play
the
gallows
where
criminals
dangled
after
each
session
of
the
general
court
and
the
racecourse
where
heats
of
two
three
and
four
miles
were
run
were
outside
the
town
he
doubtless
remembered
the
gallows
afterwards
when
he
was
drafting
a
bill
dealing
with
crimes
and
punishments
and
the
racetrack
may
have
interested
him
somewhat
at
first
he
had
more
freedom
to
go
to
that
sort
of
place
after
he
became
a
law
student
at
the
age
of
nineteen
and
had
lodgings
in
town
these
could
have
been
on
either
of
the
two
narrower
streets
that
paralleled
the
duke
of
gloucester
or
on
some
cross
street
but
nobody
knows
just
where
they
were
he
probably
stayed
at
different
places
for
a
time
he
studied
in
the
same
room
with
john
tyler
and
a
much
less
serious
young
man
from
gloucester
county
named
frank
willis
the
latter
who
delighted
in
pranks
sometimes
overturned
the
table
when
he
came
in
late
and
found
the
two
others
still
at
work
by
the
time
that
jefferson
was
grown
he
had
his
servant
jupiter
with
him
in
williamsburg
and
during
some
of
his
years
as
a
law
student
he
kept
horses
there
as
his
gay
friend
willis
did
but
whether
he
walked
or
rode
and
whatever
point
he
may
have
started
from
he
went
more
often
in
the
direction
of
the
governor
s
palace
than
the
capitol
at
first
turning
from
the
duke
of
gloucester
street
at
the
palace
green
and
passing
the
yard
of
bruton
church
he
came
to
the
home
of
george
wythe
here
he
stopped
frequently
to
be
greeted
by
a
middle
sized
hook
nosed
gentleman
who
was
noted
for
his
courtly
bow
this
dignified
brick
house
became
for
jefferson
a
sort
of
anteroom
to
the
palace
though
it
had
meaning
in
itself
it
had
been
built
and
was
owned
by
richard
taliaferro
who
has
been
described
as
the
leading
architect
or
builder
of
the
colony
and
whose
daughter
elizabeth
had
married
wythe
taliaferro
had
a
plantation
a
few
miles
out
of
town
but
he
probably
visited
the
childless
couple
and
from
him
jefferson
may
have
heard
something
about
architecture
wythe
was
not
interested
in
that
subject
he
was
to
be
jefferson
s
teacher
in
the
law
for
considerable
stretches
during
the
next
five
years
the
younger
man
was
at
shadwell
but
he
spent
most
of
the
time
reading
and
he
got
his
directions
in
williamsburg
in
the
year
when
thomas
jefferson
finished
college
and
began
to
study
law
george
wythe
was
about
thirty
five
years
old
if
not
yet
the
first
at
the
bar
of
the
general
court
he
was
already
one
of
its
most
distinguished
members
among
those
who
shared
leadership
with
him
were
peyton
randolph
then
king
s
attorney
as
his
father
and
grandfather
had
been
before
him
and
the
latter
s
brother
john
who
was
to
succeed
him
in
that
family
office
four
years
later
both
of
these
prominent
relatives
of
jefferson
were
legal
products
of
the
inner
temple
in
virginia
in
the
eighteenth
century
as
in
maryland
and
south
carolina
the
quality
of
the
bar
had
been
much
improved
by
the
influence
of
men
who
had
been
trained
in
england
it
was
after
jefferson
had
turned
twenty
that
he
wrote
with
apparent
seriousness
to
john
page
about
going
abroad
he
may
have
thought
of
accompanying
william
small
and
of
making
the
grand
tour
but
he
did
not
mention
the
inns
of
court
if
he
had
gone
to
the
inner
temple
he
would
doubtless
have
met
charles
carroll
of
carrollton
and
at
the
middle
temple
he
could
have
found
charles
cotesworth
pinckney
of
south
carolina
there
would
still
have
been
time
for
him
to
hear
william
pitt
in
the
commons
and
david
garrick
at
the
play
at
some
table
he
might
even
have
caught
snatches
of
the
conversation
of
samuel
johnson
though
there
is
little
reason
to
suppose
that
he
would
have
liked
it
he
would
have
formed
inter
colonial
friendships
and
become
a
citizen
of
the
world
sooner
if
he
had
gone
to
england
but
it
is
doubtful
if
he
would
have
learned
any
more
law
or
qualified
himself
any
better
for
his
historical
role
than
he
actually
did
by
private
study
in
his
own
colony
there
can
be
no
possible
question
about
his
mature
judgment
of
foreign
education
for
americans
for
he
said
that
a
volume
would
be
necessary
to
enumerate
all
its
disadvantages
he
saw
no
need
whatever
for
anybody
except
a
student
of
medicine
to
go
abroad
among
the
many
advantages
of
being
educated
at
home
was
one
very
practical
one
and
this
he
mentioned
to
one
of
his
young
friends
cast
your
eye
over
america
he
said
who
are
the
men
of
most
learning
of
most
eloquence
most
beloved
by
their
countrymen
and
most
trusted
and
promoted
by
them
they
are
those
who
have
been
educated
among
them
and
whose
manners
morals
and
habits
are
perfectly
homogeneous
with
those
of
the
country
he
made
these
patriotic
observations
more
than
twenty
years
after
he
began
to
study
with
wythe
but
if
he
had
had
to
start
all
over
again
it
is
extremely
unlikely
that
he
would
have
changed
his
plan
other
leaders
of
the
growing
virginia
bar
like
robert
carter
nicholas
edmund
pendleton
and
wythe
himself
had
been
educated
locally
and
the
approved
method
was
that
of
reading
in
some
lawyer
s
office
several
years
before
jefferson
entered
the
college
john
adams
facing
a
similar
problem
of
legal
education
in
massachusetts
had
made
an
agreement
with
james
putnam
of
worcester
to
study
for
two
years
under
his
inspection
while
carrying
on
his
own
teaching
in
the
local
school
formal
legal
instruction
was
not
to
begin
until
after
the
colonies
had
become
states
toward
the
end
of
the
revolution
under
the
inspiration
of
jefferson
himself
wythe
was
to
assume
a
chair
of
law
at
the
college
of
william
and
mary
and
a
few
years
later
tapping
reeve
was
to
set
up
his
famous
school
at
litchfield
connecticut
in
deciding
to
study
law
jefferson
had
no
such
scruples
to
overcome
as
had
troubled
adams
for
the
profession
was
in
better
odor
in
virginia
and
he
had
no
craving
for
the
church
in
the
narrow
sense
it
was
not
a
profitable
calling
in
this
colony
because
of
the
jealousy
of
the
dominant
planters
and
their
desire
to
discourage
petty
practitioners
the
fees
of
attorneys
had
been
sharply
restricted
by
statute
but
landholders
who
followed
the
law
could
continue
to
draw
upon
their
acres
for
support
and
the
heir
of
peter
jefferson
doubtless
expected
to
do
just
that
realizing
that
it
was
one
of
his
many
privileges
he
was
to
pursue
the
law
as
a
learned
and
useful
profession
with
notable
devotion
until
great
public
events
deflected
his
course
his
choice
of
wythe
as
a
guide
instead
of
one
of
the
randolphs
or
somebody
else
and
wythe
s
agreement
to
receive
him
were
probably
owing
to
their
mutual
friend
william
small
he
was
eternally
grateful
for
these
good
offices
and
always
convinced
of
the
wisdom
of
his
decision
not
merely
because
his
mentor
was
the
most
learned
and
possibly
the
most
effective
of
the
local
group
but
also
because
of
the
greater
range
and
liberality
of
his
mind
jefferson
did
not
have
a
high
opinion
of
the
apprentice
system
as
such
for
he
recognized
the
temptation
of
a
practising
lawyer
to
throw
too
great
a
burden
of
office
business
on
a
student
about
two
years
after
his
admission
to
the
bar
he
wrote
to
his
uncle
by
marriage
thomas
turpin
in
regard
to
the
latter
s
son
philip
the
only
help
a
youth
wants
is
to
be
directed
what
books
to
read
and
in
what
order
to
read
them
he
himself
probably
looked
up
cases
for
his
senior
in
the
law
library
at
the
capitol
he
undoubtedly
attended
sessions
of
the
general
court
and
may
have
done
some
clerical
service
there
and
he
probably
was
set
to
drawing
papers
in
wythe
s
office
from
the
date
of
his
earliest
records
jefferson
was
a
careful
draftsman
and
a
good
penman
with
a
clear
engrossing
hand
and
he
must
have
had
immediate
exercise
in
paper
work
it
is
unlikely
though
that
he
was
ever
an
apprentice
in
any
strict
sense
or
that
wythe
ever
wanted
him
to
be
one
there
is
no
existing
record
that
he
paid
any
fee
and
it
is
impossible
to
say
just
how
long
he
was
physically
present
in
wythe
s
office
during
his
second
year
he
studied
for
months
after
christmas
at
shadwell
returning
to
williamsburg
in
the
fall
of
his
third
after
that
he
probably
read
wherever
he
liked
and
on
his
own
schedule
he
followed
an
appallingly
rigorous
program
most
of
the
time
unless
the
sincerity
of
his
advice
to
others
and
the
entries
in
his
own
notebooks
are
to
be
doubted
he
had
a
mild
fling
as
a
privileged
young
gentleman
during
the
first
two
years
and
gave
himself
some
time
for
such
frivolities
as
are
common
between
the
ages
of
nineteen
and
twenty
one
but
though
the
social
gaieties
of
the
provincial
capital
and
of
the
plantation
houses
allured
him
at
first
it
must
have
been
before
he
entered
upon
what
he
called
the
business
of
life
and
while
he
was
still
primarily
a
student
that
he
copied
into
his
literary
notebook
a
sobering
extract
about
the
shortage
of
time
youth
is
not
rich
in
time
it
may
be
poor
part
with
it
as
with
money
sparing
pay
no
moment
but
in
purchase
of
it
s
worth
and
what
it
s
worth
ask
death
bells
they
can
tell
part
with
it
as
with
life
reluctant
big
with
holy
hope
of
nobler
time
to
come
he
never
found
hours
enough
to
accomplish
his
intellectual
purposes
in
all
that
he
said
afterwards
about
the
education
of
a
lawyer
he
made
it
clear
that
the
foundations
must
be
both
deep
and
broad
knowledge
of
latin
and
french
he
regarded
as
absolutely
necessary
the
first
book
that
he
used
involved
both
of
these
languages
though
the
french
was
not
such
as
he
was
to
hear
later
at
the
court
of
versailles
he
thought
of
mathematics
and
natural
philosophy
as
studies
too
useful
and
delightful
for
anyone
to
miss
and
regarded
them
particularly
mathematics
as
invaluable
in
exercising
the
mind
he
continued
to
make
scientific
observations
with
small
until
this
teacher
and
friend
left
for
england
and
if
he
needed
any
guidance
in
his
continued
reading
of
the
classics
wythe
was
abundantly
qualified
to
supply
it
wythe
s
early
education
had
been
handicapped
by
poverty
though
he
inherited
an
estate
after
he
became
a
man
that
he
was
largely
self
taught
with
his
mother
s
help
and
that
until
the
age
of
thirty
he
had
devoted
himself
almost
exclusively
to
the
law
did
not
prevent
his
becoming
a
noted
classical
scholar
the
best
in
virginia
jefferson
said
an
english
traveler
who
had
met
wythe
even
earlier
said
that
he
had
a
perfect
knowledge
of
greek
and
of
ancient
philosophy
particularly
the
platonic
he
never
lured
jefferson
into
platonic
paths
but
he
led
him
to
improve
his
greek
at
which
he
was
not
so
good
as
at
latin
wythe
later
injected
classical
quotations
into
his
judicial
opinions
in
a
way
that
was
little
short
of
pedantic
but
early
in
his
career
he
imbibed
the
spirit
of
ancient
civilization
at
its
best
the
aforesaid
traveler
who
was
generally
critical
of
virginians
said
that
to
his
classical
learning
he
had
joined
such
a
profound
reverence
for
the
supreme
being
such
respect
for
the
divine
laws
such
philanthropy
for
mankind
such
simplicity
of
manners
and
such
inflexible
rectitude
and
integrity
of
principle
as
would
have
dignified
a
roman
senator
even
in
the
most
virtuous
times
of
the
republic
jefferson
to
whom
the
heroes
of
antiquity
were
more
real
than
either
the
christian
saints
or
modern
historical
figures
described
him
as
his
country
s
cato
without
the
roman
s
avarice
while
someone
else
called
him
the
american
aristides
thus
showing
that
he
was
also
an
athenian
despite
his
deserved
reputation
wythe
s
intellectual
interests
were
not
so
broad
as
his
distinguished
pupil
s
afterwards
were
and
his
apprehension
was
not
so
quick
this
moderate
man
may
not
have
been
disposed
to
attack
learning
on
quite
so
wide
a
front
probably
he
never
drew
up
so
long
and
formidable
a
list
of
subjects
kindred
to
the
law
as
jefferson
afterwards
commended
to
the
young
probably
he
did
not
expect
his
protege
along
with
the
law
to
study
physics
ethics
religion
natural
philosophy
belles
lettres
criticism
rhetoric
politics
and
history
jefferson
s
recommendations
suggest
that
the
diet
at
wythe
s
board
was
generous
and
well
balanced
but
they
also
show
the
insatiable
appetite
of
his
own
omnivorous
mind
wythe
was
a
systematic
man
and
probably
encouraged
him
to
work
out
a
regular
schedule
without
requiring
him
to
fill
every
moment
from
dawn
to
bedtime
if
we
may
judge
from
jefferson
s
own
recommendations
the
hours
from
eight
to
twelve
in
the
morning
when
his
mental
vigor
was
greatest
were
devoted
exclusively
to
the
law
the
rest
of
the
time
except
for
a
period
of
afternoon
exercise
was
given
to
allied
subjects
he
relegated
literature
and
oratory
to
the
evening
hours
but
there
is
plenty
of
evidence
that
he
did
not
neglect
them
he
would
hardly
have
recommended
such
a
comprehensive
and
exacting
schedule
if
he
had
not
tried
it
out
himself
and
he
probably
approximated
his
ideal
after
a
year
or
two
the
technical
study
of
the
law
was
then
a
dreary
ramble
as
john
adams
said
for
books
that
smoothed
the
student
s
path
did
not
exist
textbooks
of
the
modern
sort
were
unknown
and
blackstone
s
famous
commentaries
had
not
yet
appeared
all
lawbooks
had
to
be
imported
and
there
was
a
sad
shortage
of
them
in
the
colonies
generally
there
were
no
american
reports
of
cases
english
reports
were
scarce
and
in
most
colonies
collections
of
their
own
statutes
were
hard
to
get
few
people
in
virginia
could
ever
boast
a
complete
set
and
the
collection
which
jefferson
eventually
amassed
was
notable
in
its
time
at
the
beginning
an
abridgment
of
the
acts
of
assembly
was
available
to
him
this
extended
to
january
and
by
his
annotations
he
brought
and
kept
it
up
to
date
as
colonial
conditions
went
williamsburg
was
rich
in
legal
resources
and
like
john
adams
he
became
a
systematic
purchaser
of
such
books
as
were
obtainable
he
never
lacked
food
though
it
must
often
have
seemed
unpalatable
wythe
started
him
on
coke
upon
littleton
which
constituted
the
first
of
four
parts
of
the
institutes
of
the
lawes
of
england
he
would
probably
have
been
directed
to
the
same
book
if
he
had
gone
to
one
of
the
inns
of
court
for
it
had
been
the
lawyers
primer
in
its
homeland
for
more
than
a
century
and
a
dozen
editions
of
it
had
appeared
in
the
course
of
time
this
student
was
to
gain
a
conception
of
the
law
not
as
an
immutable
system
but
as
something
that
lives
and
moves
he
had
no
immediate
reason
to
expect
that
however
when
he
began
to
struggle
with
the
black
letter
text
and
uncouth
but
cunning
learning
of
sir
edward
coke
coke
had
reprinted
in
the
norman
french
the
classic
treatise
of
littleton
on
tenures
which
he
regarded
as
the
most
perfect
and
absolute
work
that
was
ever
written
in
any
humane
science
had
added
an
english
translation
and
had
heaped
around
the
text
in
bewildering
mass
his
own
definitions
and
learned
notes
to
the
beginner
this
folio
must
have
seemed
heavy
and
formidable
but
if
he
did
not
wander
too
far
afield
he
might
learn
here
just
how
land
was
held
in
virginia
as
in
the
mother
country
this
was
a
matter
of
the
first
importance
this
primer
of
legal
learning
was
more
than
a
book
to
jefferson
it
was
a
person
he
packed
him
in
a
trunk
before
leaving
williamsburg
for
a
stay
at
shadwell
possibly
hoping
to
smother
him
he
called
him
an
old
dull
scoundrel
and
he
consigned
him
to
the
devil
other
eminent
men
expressed
themselves
even
more
strongly
the
old
jurist
profoundly
discouraged
john
quincy
adams
and
daniel
webster
and
he
drove
joseph
story
actually
to
tears
but
these
were
younger
men
not
bred
in
so
stern
a
school
jefferson
learned
from
wythe
as
john
adams
did
from
jeremiah
gridley
that
there
was
no
choice
but
to
conquer
coke
he
gained
deep
respect
for
him
as
young
story
did
and
in
long
retrospect
he
preferred
coke
s
crabbed
text
and
uncouth
learning
to
the
honeyed
words
of
blackstone
which
were
so
much
easier
to
understand
old
coke
was
not
unsympathetic
indeed
he
counseled
the
beginner
wisely
mine
advice
to
the
student
is
that
before
he
read
any
part
of
our
commentaries
upon
any
section
that
first
he
read
again
and
again
our
author
himself
in
that
section
and
do
his
best
endeavours
first
of
himself
and
then
by
conference
with
others
which
is
the
life
of
study
to
understand
it
and
then
to
read
our
commentary
thereupon
and
no
more
at
any
one
time
than
he
is
able
with
a
delight
to
bear
away
and
after
to
meditate
thereon
which
is
the
life
of
reading
if
george
wythe
s
student
followed
coke
s
excellent
advice
this
is
the
passage
in
the
english
translation
of
the
text
which
he
read
first
tenant
in
fee
simple
is
he
which
hath
lands
or
tenements
to
hold
to
him
and
his
heirs
for
ever
and
it
is
called
in
latin
feodum
simplex
for
feodum
is
the
same
that
inheritance
is
and
simplex
is
as
much
as
to
say
lawful
or
pure
and
so
feodum
simplex
signifies
a
lawful
or
pure
inheritance
then
if
his
eye
happened
to
stray
to
the
notes
in
the
adjoining
column
he
could
have
observed
that
tenant
is
derived
of
the
verb
teneo
and
hath
in
the
law
five
significations
coke
s
definitions
word
by
word
and
phrase
by
phrase
were
there
for
him
to
read
and
ponder
over
he
probably
did
not
share
coke
s
reverence
for
the
text
very
long
and
in
the
end
the
notes
must
have
seemed
minute
they
even
extended
to
littleton
s
use
of
an
etc
this
was
not
the
best
place
to
discover
broad
legal
principles
but
when
jefferson
in
the
next
decade
moved
in
the
virginia
house
of
delegates
that
tenants
in
fee
tail
should
hold
their
lands
in
fee
simple
and
thus
acquire
a
pure
inheritance
he
could
have
reflected
that
he
first
learned
the
meaning
of
these
crucial
terms
from
littleton
and
coke
even
the
physical
form
of
this
old
commentary
unusual
in
its
own
day
in
england
left
a
lasting
impression
the
manuscript
of
one
of
the
best
known
bills
that
he
ever
drafted
for
his
native
commonwealth
reveals
coke
s
unmistakable
influence
in
the
notes
which
first
accompany
and
then
invade
the
columned
text
in
the
course
of
time
he
studied
the
three
other
parts
of
the
famous
institutes
one
contained
the
texts
of
english
statutes
from
magna
carta
to
the
time
of
james
i
another
dealt
with
criminal
law
and
the
last
was
a
treatise
on
jurisdiction
for
long
years
he
considered
this
work
the
basis
of
legal
study
and
he
commended
it
again
and
again
he
soon
became
aware
however
that
the
law
had
developed
since
coke
s
day
that
new
laws
had
been
added
by
legislatures
and
that
new
developments
of
old
laws
had
been
brought
about
by
judges
he
was
quite
willing
to
use
later
digests
and
treatises
and
specifically
recommended
matthew
bacon
s
abridgment
lord
kames
on
equity
and
other
books
of
the
sort
the
modernity
of
his
legal
training
is
most
striking
in
the
study
and
the
emphasis
he
gave
to
the
actual
cases
that
were
argued
and
adjudged
in
the
courts
of
england
john
adams
was
equally
interested
in
pursuing
the
law
back
to
its
historic
fountains
and
he
also
talked
of
bracton
and
other
men
of
ancient
learning
but
neither
he
nor
any
other
of
jefferson
s
contemporaries
has
left
a
comparable
record
of
attention
to
the
reporters
it
was
in
connection
with
these
reports
of
cases
that
jefferson
began
after
a
few
years
to
keep
commonplace
books
his
notes
of
his
reading
contain
more
detailed
information
about
his
legal
studies
than
is
generally
available
for
the
great
lawyers
of
his
or
any
other
american
generation
these
old
notes
are
important
documents
in
the
history
of
the
case
system
they
may
now
seem
wearisome
except
to
legal
antiguarians
but
there
is
freshness
and
timelessness
in
the
advice
he
gave
a
young
contemporary
toward
the
end
of
his
own
training
in
reading
the
reporters
enter
in
a
commonplace
book
every
case
of
value
condensed
into
the
narrowest
compass
possible
which
will
admit
of
presenting
distinctly
the
principles
of
the
case
this
operation
is
doubly
useful
insomuch
as
it
obliges
the
student
to
seek
out
the
pith
of
the
case
and
habituates
him
to
a
condensation
of
thought
and
to
an
acquisition
of
the
most
valuable
of
all
talents
that
of
never
using
two
words
where
one
will
do
it
fixes
the
case
too
more
indelibly
in
the
mind
under
wythe
he
started
with
coke
whose
lore
could
not
be
abstracted
and
he
proceeded
step
by
step
until
he
finally
reached
maturity
from
his
study
of
the
cases
during
his
unhurried
period
of
legal
tutelage
he
formed
enduring
habits
of
study
while
under
the
influence
of
men
as
well
as
books
ideas
germinated
within
his
fertile
mind
his
law
teacher
besides
being
a
classicist
and
a
courtly
gentleman
was
a
successful
practitioner
at
the
bar
of
the
general
court
and
an
esteemed
member
of
the
house
of
burgesses
jefferson
soon
seeing
him
in
action
in
both
places
noted
his
easy
elocution
and
chaste
language
and
his
urbanity
in
debate
he
himself
was
to
be
more
precipitate
in
politics
and
eventually
he
took
the
lead
but
there
was
never
a
rift
between
him
and
his
old
friend
always
there
was
mutual
respect
and
affection
in
jefferson
s
early
history
the
name
of
george
wythe
is
inseparable
from
those
of
william
small
and
francis
fauquier
his
intimate
association
with
this
trio
as
a
trio
must
have
begun
before
when
small
went
back
to
england
and
jefferson
himself
became
twenty
one
it
may
have
dated
from
his
college
days
but
it
probably
took
form
soon
after
he
began
to
study
law
he
was
not
yet
grown
when
by
happy
chance
he
was
regularly
admitted
as
a
fourth
member
of
the
party
which
had
been
dining
frequently
at
the
palace
since
the
governor
s
family
had
returned
home
at
these
dinners
jefferson
said
long
afterward
he
heard
more
good
sense
more
rational
and
philosophical
conversations
than
at
any
other
time
in
his
life
his
much
quoted
statement
may
reflect
the
imperfect
memory
of
an
old
man
and
the
exaggerated
emphasis
of
age
on
youthful
experience
but
unquestionably
it
contains
a
nugget
of
important
truth
he
was
to
know
wythe
much
the
longest
of
the
three
and
to
love
him
most
this
learned
temperate
and
kindly
gentleman
not
quick
to
apprehend
but
profound
in
penetration
may
have
lacked
the
contagious
enthusiasm
of
the
professor
or
the
sophisticated
charm
of
the
governor
but
he
was
doubtless
the
wisest
counselor
and
the
safest
exemplar
of
the
three
indeed
it
is
hard
to
see
how
a
better
could
have
been
found
vi
the
school
of
manners
a
square
beyond
the
wythe
house
in
williamsburg
stood
the
governor
s
palace
commanding
the
green
a
generation
before
jefferson
went
there
it
was
described
as
a
magnificent
structure
finished
and
beautified
with
gates
and
gardens
offices
and
walks
orchards
and
a
fine
canal
the
ballroom
wing
had
been
added
in
the
meantime
but
little
had
been
spent
on
the
estate
in
the
last
decade
in
his
maturity
jefferson
did
not
regard
the
large
brick
mansion
as
handsome
but
since
he
had
measured
it
he
spoke
advisedly
about
the
spaciousness
of
its
interior
he
liked
the
situation
and
thought
that
if
the
grounds
were
developed
it
might
be
made
an
elegant
seat
one
can
only
guess
what
his
opinion
of
it
would
be
in
its
present
restored
perfection
but
in
his
student
days
when
he
dined
and
performed
in
amateur
musicals
at
the
palace
he
undoubtedly
found
more
elegance
there
than
he
had
ever
before
observed
his
host
was
francis
fauquier
who
continued
to
be
the
chief
resident
official
of
the
province
until
a
year
after
jefferson
was
admitted
to
the
bar
he
afterwards
described
fauquier
as
the
ablest
man
who
ever
filled
the
chair
of
government
in
williamsburg
though
he
may
have
been
thinking
of
only
the
colonial
period
and
not
of
the
two
first
executives
of
the
commonwealth
who
sat
in
the
same
chair
patrick
henry
and
himself
he
probably
would
have
made
the
generalization
in
any
case
when
he
first
met
this
governor
however
his
own
mind
was
not
yet
turned
to
affairs
of
state
and
he
knew
his
predecessor
chiefly
as
a
gentleman
as
a
patron
of
learning
and
as
a
friend
of
the
arts
fauquier
had
come
to
virginia
at
the
age
of
fifty
four
two
years
before
jefferson
entered
college
he
was
the
son
of
a
huguenot
physician
who
took
refuge
in
england
found
employment
at
the
mint
under
sir
isaac
newton
married
an
englishwoman
and
eventually
became
a
director
of
the
bank
of
england
francis
was
born
in
london
and
until
about
the
time
of
his
marriage
into
a
county
family
he
followed
a
military
career
he
then
appears
to
have
lived
the
life
of
a
country
gentleman
in
hertfordshire
his
uncle
william
a
successful
merchant
who
was
addicted
to
scientific
studies
made
him
his
heir
and
after
the
death
of
this
uncle
he
became
like
him
a
director
of
the
south
sea
company
and
a
fellow
of
the
royal
society
he
is
said
to
have
been
well
regarded
in
the
merchant
group
and
he
had
many
acquaintances
in
philosophical
circles
the
story
long
current
in
virginia
that
his
appointment
as
lieutenant
governor
was
owing
to
the
compassion
of
lord
anson
after
the
latter
had
won
his
entire
patrimony
in
a
single
night
s
play
at
cards
emphasizes
one
aspect
of
his
reputation
but
cannot
be
accepted
as
sober
fact
appointments
to
colonial
offices
in
the
eighteenth
century
cannot
always
be
fully
explained
but
this
one
may
be
attributed
in
part
to
the
reputation
which
fauquier
had
gained
through
a
pamphlet
published
by
him
the
year
before
the
death
of
peter
jefferson
dedicated
to
lord
anson
it
dealt
with
the
burning
question
of
financial
support
for
the
war
with
france
and
it
attracted
enough
attention
to
warrant
two
additional
editions
it
was
of
advantage
to
fauquier
in
virginia
that
he
followed
an
unpopular
governor
and
it
was
to
his
credit
there
that
he
endeavored
to
maintain
harmonious
relations
between
the
colony
and
the
authorities
at
home
in
the
ecclesiastical
controversy
his
sympathies
were
all
with
the
local
authorities
and
both
in
policy
and
person
he
was
almost
everything
that
the
gentlemen
of
virginia
could
have
wished
their
governor
to
be
his
great
personal
popularity
may
be
attributed
to
the
fact
that
he
was
possessed
of
ail
the
social
virtues
in
an
eminent
degree
and
that
he
found
among
the
people
or
at
least
the
leaders
of
the
colony
a
character
compounded
of
the
same
elements
as
his
own
the
great
landholders
whom
he
received
at
the
palace
and
visited
during
the
recess
of
the
assembly
and
the
courts
found
in
his
manners
a
model
such
as
some
of
them
had
seen
in
england
and
others
had
read
about
in
books
here
was
the
complete
gentleman
in
living
form
he
had
classical
learning
of
the
kind
that
was
associated
with
the
names
of
the
second
richard
lee
and
the
second
william
byrd
and
was
exemplified
among
his
contemporaries
by
george
wythe
his
patronage
of
science
may
have
chiefly
impressed
youngsters
like
thomas
jefferson
and
john
page
but
the
high
favor
with
which
william
small
was
regarded
by
leading
men
shows
that
it
was
far
from
unwelcome
at
the
time
in
this
respect
as
in
others
fauquier
was
fashionable
and
modern
he
was
a
curious
observer
of
natural
phenomena
who
discussed
current
philosophical
questions
with
his
appreciative
friends
examples
of
his
own
observations
survive
during
his
first
year
in
the
colony
he
sent
to
his
brother
in
england
an
account
of
a
strange
hailstorm
which
descended
upon
williamsburg
on
an
unusually
hot
sunday
afternoon
in
july
when
this
was
communicated
to
the
royal
society
the
savants
could
have
noted
with
satisfaction
that
the
hailstones
were
described
with
scientific
precision
both
as
to
their
shape
and
size
the
storm
broke
every
pane
of
glass
on
the
north
side
of
the
palace
and
destroyed
the
garden
and
the
governor
cooled
his
wine
and
froze
cream
with
some
of
the
ice
next
day
young
jefferson
must
have
heard
this
story
after
he
came
to
town
and
he
may
have
gained
from
fauquier
his
first
ideas
about
the
regular
recording
of
the
temperature
and
winds
the
latter
kept
a
diary
of
the
weather
in
williamsburg
for
just
the
years
that
his
young
friend
was
there
in
college
and
afterwards
turned
this
over
to
an
english
traveler
who
published
it
as
an
appendix
to
a
book
it
was
precisely
the
sort
of
record
that
jefferson
himself
kept
so
religiously
at
monticello
and
at
almost
every
other
place
where
he
stayed
for
long
the
only
serious
blot
on
fauquier
s
character
was
his
love
for
gambling
the
later
statement
that
he
introduced
the
fatal
propensity
to
gaming
into
virginia
seems
extreme
in
view
of
the
practices
which
had
been
observed
there
before
he
came
but
he
encouraged
these
by
his
own
example
and
had
a
part
in
making
gambling
a
fashionable
form
of
vice
this
was
a
time
of
extravagance
and
losses
are
said
to
have
been
dangerously
high
in
his
day
in
williamsburg
a
traveler
observed
that
in
the
taverns
at
night
there
was
carousing
and
drinking
in
one
chamber
and
a
box
and
dice
in
the
other
and
that
this
sort
of
thing
lasted
till
morning
he
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
there
was
not
a
public
house
in
virginia
but
had
its
tables
all
battered
with
diceboxes
how
deep
rooted
such
evils
were
no
traveler
could
really
judge
but
more
sober
years
were
coming
just
prior
to
the
revolution
a
young
tutor
observed
in
westmoreland
that
a
new
spirit
of
seriousness
had
entered
virginia
life
that
seriousness
was
exemplified
by
george
washington
and
by
thomas
jefferson
himself
there
was
more
recklessness
in
the
golden
decade
of
fauquier
when
there
were
fewer
great
things
for
men
to
do
jefferson
said
that
when
he
was
assailed
by
moral
temptation
during
his
youth
and
young
manhood
he
used
to
ask
himself
how
small
or
wythe
or
peyton
randolph
would
act
he
did
not
invoke
the
example
of
fauquier
at
the
governor
s
table
he
heard
highly
stimulating
conversation
and
in
this
court
he
acquired
graces
which
adorned
his
life
but
he
found
his
moral
standards
elsewhere
he
did
not
pick
up
such
vices
as
his
elegant
host
exemplified
unless
generosity
and
love
of
elegance
should
be
accounted
vices
but
a
certain
longing
for
magnificence
in
the
spirit
of
the
renaissance
could
be
observed
among
rich
virginia
planters
and
found
early
expression
in
the
career
of
thomas
jefferson
he
may
have
got
it
from
his
countrymen
or
from
his
reading
but
he
may
have
caught
it
from
francis
fauquier
it
was
probably
after
jefferson
had
begun
to
study
law
under
george
wythe
that
the
musical
governor
who
was
a
good
performer
himself
associated
him
with
two
or
three
other
amateurs
in
the
weekly
concerts
at
the
palace
he
may
have
neglected
his
instrument
for
his
books
while
he
was
at
the
college
but
he
afterwards
reported
that
for
twelve
years
before
the
revolution
he
played
no
fewer
than
three
hours
a
day
while
he
was
still
a
student
in
williamsburg
he
found
musical
opportunities
such
as
he
had
never
had
before
and
which
as
a
performer
he
was
not
to
know
again
he
had
no
chance
to
see
sculpture
or
fine
paintings
there
but
traveling
companies
brought
comic
operas
from
time
to
time
and
music
was
cultivated
by
amateurs
the
professional
authority
of
the
place
was
peter
pelham
son
of
a
mezzotint
artist
of
boston
and
organist
of
bruton
church
who
supplemented
his
income
by
taking
pupils
among
them
jefferson
s
friend
anne
blair
at
a
later
time
he
gained
a
further
supplement
by
assuming
the
incongruous
position
of
keeper
of
the
public
gaol
he
then
gave
condemned
criminals
a
chance
to
hear
music
before
their
execution
taking
them
to
the
church
in
shackles
in
later
years
he
often
played
for
jefferson
who
treated
him
afterwards
or
paid
him
for
his
pains
the
auditor
filled
the
role
of
generous
patron
at
that
time
and
place
the
status
of
the
professional
was
inferior
jefferson
was
hardly
proficient
enough
for
the
first
violin
part
at
the
palace
he
probably
had
the
second
part
and
may
even
have
played
on
the
cello
for
he
was
a
passable
performer
on
that
instrument
at
a
later
time
the
first
violinist
was
probably
john
randolph
brother
of
peyton
he
was
not
only
a
lawyer
he
published
a
book
on
gardening
which
jefferson
acquired
councillor
robert
carter
a
close
friend
of
the
governor
who
played
on
the
harpsichord
and
the
german
flute
was
probably
a
member
of
the
group
in
his
house
next
door
to
the
palace
he
installed
an
organ
which
had
been
built
for
him
in
london
and
it
is
likely
that
jefferson
heard
music
there
he
was
unsuccessful
in
his
later
attempt
to
purchase
this
instrument
it
is
possible
that
john
page
participated
in
the
concerts
gifts
bought
fiddle
strings
regularly
before
visiting
his
friend
at
rosewell
and
undoubtedly
he
played
there
there
was
a
musical
accompaniment
to
many
of
jefferson
s
most
intimate
associations
throughout
the
first
half
of
his
life
and
it
was
probably
during
these
years
at
williamsburg
that
music
became
the
favorite
passion
of
his
soul
afterwards
e
he
bemoaned
the
fate
which
had
cast
his
lot
in
a
country
where
it
was
in
a
deplorable
state
of
barbarism
but
this
was
during
the
revolution
some
time
after
fauquier
had
gone
in
the
setting
of
the
palace
ballroom
where
a
little
group
of
enthusiastic
amateurs
performed
when
he
was
young
barbarism
seemed
remote
jefferson
s
extra
legal
activities
during
his
first
years
as
a
student
under
wythe
were
not
confined
to
conversations
at
the
governor
s
table
and
musicals
in
the
palace
ballroom
to
a
degree
he
played
a
conventional
part
elsewhere
as
a
young
gentleman
his
friendship
with
older
men
is
one
of
many
signs
of
the
essential
seriousness
of
his
nature
they
perceived
it
and
reposed
more
confidence
in
him
than
might
have
been
expected
at
his
age
and
he
in
turn
valued
their
companionship
because
he
could
learn
so
much
from
them
in
his
relations
with
his
contemporaries
he
soon
became
discriminating
he
never
suffered
fools
gladly
and
it
is
hard
to
think
of
him
as
ever
having
been
intellectually
immature
as
a
recognized
member
of
the
younger
gentry
however
he
participated
in
the
customary
social
life
and
in
i
the
doing
showed
that
in
certain
important
respects
he
had
not
yet
attained
the
full
stature
of
a
man
even
though
he
now
towered
a
couple
of
inches
beyond
six
feet
his
social
activities
were
natural
and
innocent
he
danced
at
the
raleigh
tavern
visited
at
plantation
houses
made
wagers
with
girls
gossiped
about
courtships
and
as
time
went
on
served
as
an
attendant
at
weddings
he
was
and
remained
part
of
a
close
knit
social
group
and
he
knew
well
the
favored
sons
and
daughters
of
this
fertile
land
during
the
months
that
he
spent
away
from
williamsburg
which
he
sometimes
called
devils
burg
he
often
bemoaned
the
lack
of
companionship
to
john
page
he
wrote
once
from
shadwell
all
things
here
appear
to
me
to
trudge
on
in
one
and
the
same
round
we
rise
in
the
morning
that
we
may
eat
breakfast
dinner
and
supper
and
go
to
bed
again
that
we
may
get
up
the
next
morning
and
do
the
same
so
that
you
never
saw
two
peas
more
alike
than
our
yesterday
and
today
he
was
not
interested
in
cultivating
this
favorite
vegetable
as
yet
and
had
not
observed
as
he
did
later
that
not
even
two
peas
are
identical
during
the
same
period
he
wrote
to
another
friend
i
do
not
like
the
ups
and
downs
of
a
country
life
today
you
are
frolicking
with
a
fine
girl
and
tomorrow
you
are
moping
by
yourself
at
few
times
during
the
course
of
his
long
life
did
he
ever
seem
so
bored
there
are
many
self
conscious
passages
in
the
few
early
letters
of
his
that
remain
had
the
matter
been
left
to
him
he
probably
would
have
burned
those
youthful
effusions
which
john
page
and
william
fleming
preserved
and
which
in
the
absence
of
other
records
his
biographers
have
worn
so
bare
they
do
not
reveal
half
enough
but
they
disclose
a
great
deal
which
the
mature
man
would
not
have
relished
they
are
not
without
charm
and
cleverness
for
he
had
already
learned
to
turn
a
happy
phrase
but
they
are
filled
with
learned
conceits
which
are
not
at
all
characteristic
of
one
who
afterwards
wore
the
mantle
of
scholarship
lightly
as
a
gentleman
was
supposed
to
do
their
humor
is
often
labored
for
grace
did
not
yet
compensate
for
the
lack
of
striking
wit
worst
of
all
they
are
full
of
references
to
girls
these
would
have
horrified
him
in
later
years
when
he
was
so
reticent
about
personal
affairs
and
particularly
about
his
relations
with
womankind
the
dignity
and
restraint
of
middle
age
were
more
characteristic
and
also
more
becoming
his
earliest
letters
are
interspersed
with
quotations
from
the
classics
with
an
occasional
phrase
in
french
he
referred
to
friends
and
acquaintances
by
using
rough
latin
equivalents
parvus
for
william
small
and
currus
for
dabney
carr
he
wrote
to
william
fleming
as
will
but
john
page
he
addressed
as
dear
page
his
use
of
familiar
given
names
probably
declined
from
the
time
that
he
left
maury
s
school
and
it
ceased
when
he
and
his
friends
attained
maturity
then
formality
became
the
rule
while
still
in
the
familiar
stage
he
spoke
of
alice
corbin
with
whom
he
had
bet
a
pair
of
garters
of
sukey
potter
whom
he
hoped
will
fleming
would
marry
though
actually
he
did
not
of
nancy
wilton
whom
page
appears
to
have
courted
briefly
of
jenny
taliaferro
who
played
the
spinet
and
sang
well
most
of
all
he
talked
of
rebecca
burwell
she
provided
the
only
romantic
story
of
his
youth
but
it
is
not
a
particularly
good
one
he
was
an
indecisive
suitor
and
emerged
too
rarely
from
the
realm
of
thought
this
girl
whom
he
referred
to
as
r
b
becca
be
linda
company
in
die
and
adnileb
on
the
pretense
that
some
of
these
thin
disguises
would
deceive
all
but
his
closest
friends
was
an
orphan
with
the
best
of
connections
her
father
became
a
member
of
the
council
in
the
year
that
thomas
jefferson
was
born
he
was
present
when
joshua
fry
and
peter
jefferson
reported
that
they
had
extended
the
dividing
line
as
acting
governor
he
consulted
the
board
about
employing
them
to
draw
a
map
of
the
inhabited
part
of
virginia
and
soon
after
that
he
died
the
date
of
the
death
of
rebecca
s
mother
is
uncertain
but
when
jefferson
met
her
the
orphaned
girl
was
in
the
charge
of
her
uncle
by
marriage
william
nelson
of
york
also
a
councillor
and
afterwards
acting
governor
he
is
generally
referred
to
as
president
nelson
while
his
brother
thomas
is
known
as
secretary
nelson
and
his
own
son
thomas
is
usually
called
the
signer
it
was
the
latter
who
succeeded
jefferson
as
governor
of
the
commonwealth
during
the
revolution
jefferson
addressed
him
as
dear
nelson
and
long
maintained
intimate
relations
with
this
wealthy
and
influential
family
as
was
natural
enough
in
view
of
his
friendship
with
john
page
he
may
have
met
rebecca
on
a
visit
to
york
or
rosewell
but
he
probably
saw
her
first
in
williamsburg
when
her
guardian
was
there
attending
to
his
official
duties
the
tradition
is
that
she
was
beautiful
and
according
to
the
scanty
record
she
was
also
good
bishop
meade
gentle
annalist
of
virginia
churches
ministers
and
families
approvingly
quotes
a
passage
describing
her
pious
resignation
in
the
early
loss
of
her
parents
and
attributing
to
her
a
religious
enthusiasm
which
distinguished
her
from
her
giddy
companions
william
nelson
himself
was
a
zealous
churchman
for
all
his
interest
in
racing
horses
and
in
later
life
rebecca
appears
to
have
been
deeply
religious
in
the
conventional
sense
the
jefferson
of
history
was
not
that
but
it
is
possible
that
an
element
in
her
attraction
for
him
in
his
youth
was
that
she
was
somewhat
more
serious
than
the
other
girls
he
thought
himself
deeply
in
love
during
the
winter
before
he
was
twenty
and
while
she
was
still
sixteen
he
was
at
shadwell
that
winter
and
his
struggles
with
coke
s
tough
primer
of
the
law
were
being
interrupted
by
romantic
thoughts
early
marriage
was
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
in
his
class
but
he
had
also
begun
to
dream
of
a
trip
abroad
and
he
spoke
of
this
as
a
virtual
necessity
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
never
made
it
he
belabored
his
puzzled
mind
trying
to
decide
what
to
do
and
revealed
his
tortuous
mental
processes
to
his
confidant
john
page
should
he
end
his
suspense
by
going
down
to
receive
his
sentence
and
at
the
same
time
run
the
risk
of
being
ten
times
more
wretched
than
before
would
page
join
him
on
his
travels
in
a
vessel
to
be
called
the
rebecca
in
which
they
would
sail
to
many
lands
including
italy
where
a
good
fiddle
could
be
bought
if
so
they
might
both
be
cured
of
love
if
belinda
would
not
accept
his
services
he
would
never
offer
them
to
another
but
she
had
given
him
little
ground
for
hope
he
wanted
to
ask
her
to
wait
until
he
had
come
back
but
wondered
if
this
would
not
seem
an
unreasonable
request
if
she
consented
he
would
be
happy
if
not
he
would
be
as
contented
as
he
could
perfect
happiness
was
probably
not
intended
for
human
creatures
anyway
and
one
must
learn
to
be
resigned
others
of
their
gay
friends
would
be
amused
by
such
sober
reflections
he
feared
but
page
would
understand
all
this
was
in
the
mood
of
adolescence
though
the
language
was
l
learned
and
some
of
the
passages
show
that
his
mind
had
already
taken
a
speculative
turn
he
was
enjoying
his
reflective
sadness
as
well
as
his
recurrent
hopes
a
rival
had
appeared
during
his
absence
but
despite
page
s
urging
he
was
not
yet
willing
to
approach
rebecca
s
guardian
he
must
put
the
problem
before
the
girl
herself
president
nelson
would
doubtless
have
chuckled
had
he
heard
him
in
the
fall
back
in
williamsburg
jefferson
wrote
hopefully
to
will
fleming
but
soon
sent
a
melancholy
note
to
page
before
he
went
to
dance
with
belinda
in
the
apollo
room
he
had
dressed
up
his
thoughts
in
the
most
moving
language
but
when
the
time
came
his
actual
sentences
were
few
and
disordered
while
the
pauses
were
frequent
and
long
it
was
unfortunate
that
he
did
not
write
to
her
instead
of
trusting
to
his
stammering
speech
his
pen
was
his
strongest
weapon
and
the
stilted
extravagances
of
the
time
would
not
have
seemed
artificial
to
her
as
they
do
to
almost
any
reader
now
somewhat
later
he
managed
to
say
his
piece
he
talked
about
the
necessity
of
his
trip
to
england
and
deliberately
refrained
from
asking
an
outright
question
though
he
informed
the
young
lady
that
such
a
question
would
be
asked
at
some
later
time
to
her
the
remote
prospect
did
not
seem
alluring
and
this
he
must
have
sensed
for
he
made
no
effort
to
see
her
again
he
explained
this
inactivity
to
others
on
the
ground
that
he
had
been
abominably
lazy
but
the
probability
is
that
he
was
now
deeper
in
the
law
than
in
love
his
rival
was
more
aggressive
in
the
spring
shortly
before
jefferson
s
twenty
first
birthday
rebecca
became
engaged
to
jacquelin
ambler
who
was
somewhat
older
than
jefferson
and
had
really
made
up
his
mind
years
later
as
a
member
of
the
council
of
state
he
was
closely
associated
with
jefferson
as
governor
of
virginia
and
later
still
he
served
with
honor
and
great
personal
popularity
as
treasurer
of
the
commonwealth
the
revolution
seriously
affected
his
fortunes
it
also
brought
him
a
prize
son
in
law
whom
jefferson
afterwards
disliked
at
yorktown
in
mary
ambler
daughter
of
jacquelin
and
rebecca
met
captain
john
marshall
and
three
years
later
in
richmond
she
became
his
wife
ambler
acted
more
like
an
adult
than
his
rival
did
in
and
jefferson
carried
on
this
rather
absurd
affair
mostly
in
his
imagination
but
there
was
no
little
wisdom
at
the
base
of
his
uncertainty
before
he
encumbered
himself
with
a
family
he
had
many
important
things
to
do
and
although
he
did
not
go
to
england
he
did
apply
himself
to
his
studies
with
an
intensity
which
a
young
wife
could
hardly
have
been
expected
to
approve
such
thoughts
were
doubtless
in
his
mind
when
he
copied
into
his
literary
notebook
the
following
strong
passage
from
an
eighteenth
century
playwright
wed
her
no
were
she
all
desire
could
wish
as
fair
as
would
the
vainest
of
her
sex
be
thought
with
wealth
beyond
what
woman
s
pride
could
waste
she
should
not
cheat
me
of
my
freedom
marry
when
i
am
old
weary
of
the
world
i
may
grow
desperate
and
take
a
wife
to
mortify
withal
other
entries
even
more
antifeminist
lead
to
the
supposition
that
this
unhappy
experience
cured
him
temporarily
of
his
hankering
for
girls
from
paradise
lost
he
transcribed
this
o
why
did
god
creator
wise
that
peopl
d
highest
heav
n
with
spirits
masculine
create
at
last
this
novelty
on
earth
this
fair
defect
of
nature
and
not
fill
the
world
at
once
with
men
as
angels
without
feminine
or
find
some
other
way
to
generate
mankind
the
women
of
his
day
in
virginia
had
few
intellectual
advantages
and
like
an
english
traveler
who
had
recently
passed
that
way
he
may
have
concluded
that
they
were
unequal
to
any
interesting
and
refined
conversation
during
the
next
few
years
he
found
satisfaction
in
friendship
with
men
when
he
passed
philosophical
evenings
at
rosewell
with
john
page
or
talked
about
the
law
with
dabney
carr
on
an
albemarle
hillside
he
was
relatively
free
from
disturbing
thoughts
about
the
fair
defect
of
nature
dabney
carr
was
likewise
reading
coke
and
matthew
bacon
and
he
also
set
high
value
on
the
blessings
of
science
according
to
jefferson
he
had
every
excellence
which
good
sense
learning
or
virtue
could
give
it
was
of
boon
companions
such
as
these
that
he
thought
when
he
copied
into
his
notebook
a
passage
from
euripides
nothing
is
better
than
a
reliable
friend
not
riches
not
absolute
sovereignty
nay
more
the
crowd
is
not
to
be
reckoned
with
in
exchange
for
a
noble
friend
this
saying
did
more
than
match
a
fleeting
mood
it
voiced
a
conviction
which
grew
deeper
through
the
years
he
was
ever
afterwards
restrained
in
his
comments
on
individual
women
but
it
was
always
easy
for
him
to
wax
sentimental
about
a
friend
it
was
no
accident
that
his
life
was
extraordinarily
rich
in
friendship
for
he
cultivated
this
unceasingly
and
made
of
it
an
art
in
a
moment
of
irreparable
personal
loss
after
he
had
begun
to
grow
old
he
wrote
john
page
but
friends
we
have
if
we
have
merited
them
those
of
our
earliest
years
stand
nearest
in
our
affections
with
regard
to
this
first
group
however
he
did
not
regard
himself
as
wholly
fortunate
this
was
chiefly
because
of
his
own
longevity
for
the
companions
of
his
youth
vanished
from
the
field
before
he
did
some
of
them
also
were
eventually
parted
from
him
by
political
differences
though
he
regarded
this
as
an
insufficient
cause
it
was
while
he
was
president
that
he
said
to
page
of
our
college
friends
and
they
are
the
dearest
how
few
have
stood
with
us
in
the
great
political
questions
which
have
agitated
our
country
i
did
not
believe
the
lilliputian
fetters
of
that
day
strong
enough
to
have
bound
so
many
when
he
was
studying
law
the
period
of
political
strife
was
remote
but
his
two
best
friends
soon
yielded
to
the
lure
of
women
he
was
only
twenty
two
when
john
page
married
frances
daughter
of
robert
carter
burwell
of
isle
of
wight
county
she
was
to
bear
him
twelve
of
his
twenty
children
thus
participating
impressively
in
the
divine
plan
for
the
generation
of
mankind
it
was
in
the
year
also
that
dabney
carr
married
martha
jefferson
the
happiness
of
currus
greatly
impressed
martha
s
brother
and
before
it
was
cut
short
by
untimely
death
he
himself
followed
this
glowing
example
romance
returned
to
him
in
maturer
and
less
fleeting
form
and
within
his
family
he
revealed
as
nowhere
else
the
gentleness
and
tenderness
of
his
nature
but
his
own
marriage
did
not
occur
until
eight
or
nine
years
after
his
imaginative
quest
of
rebecca
burwell
no
picture
of
jefferson
as
a
young
gentleman
survives
but
there
is
a
good
deal
of
information
about
the
general
social
environment
in
which
he
lived
during
his
student
years
at
that
time
the
standards
which
fauquier
personified
and
accentuated
were
already
set
the
governor
did
not
introduce
them
they
had
been
transplanted
from
england
in
the
first
place
and
in
the
unequal
and
dispersed
society
of
a
sunny
agricultural
province
they
had
assumed
characteristic
local
form
the
polish
and
elegance
of
colonial
society
can
be
easily
exaggerated
and
unquestionably
there
was
much
crudity
behind
the
facade
even
in
the
best
circles
in
virginia
there
was
less
smoothness
than
jefferson
afterwards
observed
in
paris
where
the
roughness
of
the
human
mind
was
so
rubbed
off
that
one
might
glide
through
life
without
a
jostle
nevertheless
good
manners
were
an
essential
feature
of
the
prevailing
pattern
even
in
the
relatively
fashionable
period
of
fauquier
s
governorship
the
gentleman
did
not
need
to
be
a
dandy
and
at
a
later
time
he
was
proudly
indifferent
to
the
externalities
of
dress
ideally
however
the
gentleman
was
hospitable
and
generous
courteous
in
his
relations
with
his
peers
chivalrous
toward
women
and
kind
to
inferiors
not
everybody
was
mannerly
even
the
governor
was
rude
under
provocation
but
there
was
a
high
standard
of
politeness
which
the
gentry
recognized
and
generally
observed
politeness
as
jefferson
afterwards
remarked
is
artificial
good
humor
and
a
valuable
preservative
of
peace
and
tranquillity
the
grandson
to
whom
he
made
this
observation
preserved
a
story
of
the
mollifying
effects
of
the
best
virginia
manners
and
this
probably
came
from
jefferson
himself
the
sheriff
of
one
of
the
river
counties
who
was
described
as
a
self
made
man
though
he
founded
a
distinguished
family
had
strong
prejudices
against
the
aristocrats
approaching
the
seat
of
one
of
the
proudest
of
these
on
a
business
errand
and
seeing
him
before
the
house
the
sheriff
resolved
not
to
dismount
but
when
he
drew
near
he
was
greeted
by
the
gentleman
with
such
suavity
dignity
and
winning
grace
of
manner
that
before
he
became
aware
of
it
he
found
himself
standing
before
him
hat
in
hand
this
grandson
struck
by
the
common
quality
of
politeness
in
the
older
gentlemen
of
virginia
who
differed
in
so
many
other
ways
asked
his
grandfather
for
an
explanation
to
this
jefferson
replied
that
they
had
all
been
trained
in
williamsburg
the
finest
school
of
manners
and
morals
that
ever
existed
in
america
in
view
of
his
comments
on
his
own
personal
difficulties
and
temptations
during
his
youth
it
is
surprising
that
he
should
have
commended
the
morals
as
well
as
the
manners
of
a
place
where
students
rioted
periodically
and
drinking
and
gambling
were
so
rife
he
said
that
he
was
thrown
into
the
society
of
card
players
horse
racers
and
fox
hunters
and
left
no
doubt
that
he
regarded
such
company
as
bad
tilts
statement
however
must
be
read
side
by
side
with
other
later
remarks
of
his
about
the
grave
dangers
of
dissipation
which
american
students
would
face
in
england
in
the
course
of
time
he
came
to
regard
williamsburg
as
a
relatively
moral
place
in
this
society
pleasure
and
conviviality
were
not
frowned
upon
and
certain
personal
vices
were
condoned
the
unpardonable
sins
were
lying
and
meanness
of
spirit
plain
speech
to
one
s
peers
was
not
expected
insofar
as
possible
the
gentleman
was
supposed
to
please
the
educational
ideal
was
that
of
the
well
rounded
man
who
was
decently
familiar
with
the
classics
reasonably
current
with
philosophy
and
had
at
least
a
bowing
acquaintance
with
the
arts
only
in
the
fields
of
plantation
affairs
and
government
was
he
expected
to
be
a
specialist
there
is
no
more
reason
to
suppose
that
jefferson
uncritically
accepted
the
entire
social
code
than
that
he
contented
himself
with
meeting
the
minimal
requirements
of
education
he
conformed
outwardly
to
the
prevailing
social
standards
but
he
escaped
the
characteristic
vices
well
into
mature
manhood
he
made
small
wagers
but
in
no
real
sense
was
he
a
gambler
after
he
became
grown
it
is
doubtful
if
he
was
ever
much
of
a
drinker
though
he
acquired
a
well
stocked
cellar
in
due
course
and
eventually
became
a
connoisseur
of
wines
in
these
early
years
he
dressed
as
fastidiously
as
his
companions
he
enjoyed
dancing
and
as
a
matter
of
course
he
rode
at
no
time
probably
was
this
foe
of
indolence
and
lover
of
books
quite
conventional
but
he
responded
quickly
to
refinement
and
he
was
rarely
if
ever
coarse
he
became
a
penetrating
critic
of
the
society
in
which
he
was
born
and
bred
but
socially
he
was
in
all
respects
a
gentleman
his
distinction
lies
in
the
fact
that
he
became
a
great
deal
more
vii
listening
at
the
capitol
the
college
the
wythe
house
the
palace
the
capitol
these
were
the
focal
centers
of
jefferson
s
life
in
williamsburg
during
his
student
years
the
capitol
was
last
in
point
of
time
but
it
proved
the
most
important
in
the
end
for
it
became
a
major
scene
of
his
own
action
williamsburg
was
more
than
an
academic
village
and
a
school
of
manners
it
was
the
seat
and
school
of
provincial
government
he
could
see
the
political
institutions
of
the
colony
in
actual
operation
all
the
more
easily
because
the
place
was
small
and
could
become
personally
acquainted
with
the
able
men
who
made
them
work
the
governor
whom
jefferson
knew
so
well
and
admired
so
much
was
the
visible
representative
of
the
far
distant
king
whose
birthday
was
regularly
celebrated
in
the
town
and
whose
name
appeared
on
all
public
documents
of
any
note
around
fauquier
was
gathered
a
council
of
a
dozen
wealthy
and
influential
men
jefferson
became
friends
with
several
of
these
in
the
course
of
social
life
he
first
became
familiar
with
the
council
as
an
official
body
in
its
capacity
as
the
highest
provincial
court
of
law
in
order
to
learn
his
future
business
he
went
as
a
listener
to
the
general
court
the
capitol
was
built
in
the
form
of
the
letter
h
and
the
general
court
was
held
in
one
wing
on
the
first
floor
while
the
burgesses
met
in
the
other
there
was
little
occasion
for
him
to
climb
to
the
second
floor
where
committees
met
and
the
council
sat
in
executive
session
but
he
knew
the
first
floor
well
and
there
observed
the
house
of
burgesses
knowledge
of
it
and
its
members
was
an
important
part
of
the
education
of
future
leaders
such
as
the
sons
of
the
gentry
were
deemed
to
be
through
george
wythe
jefferson
soon
became
personally
acquainted
with
edmund
pendleton
whose
prowess
as
a
debater
he
afterwards
attested
at
an
early
time
he
marked
pendleton
as
a
leader
of
the
conservatives
but
from
the
beginning
he
regarded
him
as
a
friend
not
until
he
himself
went
to
the
bar
did
jefferson
become
intimate
with
his
mother
s
cousin
peyton
randolph
now
king
s
attorney
and
soon
to
be
speaker
of
the
house
but
he
saw
this
large
man
in
action
he
was
always
impressed
with
peyton
randolph
s
intelligence
but
never
by
his
ability
as
a
speaker
considerably
older
was
another
first
cousin
of
jane
randolph
jefferson
a
cousin
whom
her
son
regarded
as
the
most
learned
of
the
elder
group
of
statesmen
profound
in
constitutional
lore
richard
bland
looked
something
like
the
old
parchments
which
he
handled
and
studied
so
much
more
than
any
other
single
man
probably
he
laid
the
philosophical
foundations
of
the
resistance
to
the
mother
country
but
jefferson
noted
that
he
also
was
an
ungraceful
speaker
it
was
the
greatest
of
the
virginia
orators
who
gave
wide
currency
to
these
doctrines
and
of
all
the
burgesses
it
was
he
who
most
impressed
the
young
man
at
first
from
the
time
that
he
heard
patrick
henry
as
a
student
he
regarded
him
as
pre
eminent
in
the
forensic
field
in
his
maturity
jefferson
was
no
admirer
of
mere
oratory
but
he
never
questioned
the
power
of
eloquence
and
even
in
extreme
old
age
he
commended
the
study
of
it
to
youth
he
gave
it
a
recognized
place
in
his
own
program
believing
that
a
law
student
should
read
and
analyze
works
of
oratory
and
thus
become
acquainted
with
the
elevated
style
he
copied
out
examples
of
english
eloquence
some
of
them
now
obscure
he
found
chaste
specimens
in
livy
sallust
and
tacitus
and
during
his
evening
hours
he
read
demosthenes
and
cicero
whom
he
continued
to
regard
as
the
finest
models
for
the
forum
and
the
bar
while
he
was
still
in
college
he
heard
a
cherokee
chief
deliver
an
oration
which
he
never
forgot
and
three
years
later
he
stood
at
the
door
of
the
chamber
of
the
burgesses
listening
spellbound
to
patrick
henry
this
memorable
experience
constituted
more
than
an
introduction
to
vivid
local
eloquence
it
was
also
a
striking
example
of
the
sort
of
political
education
which
as
a
potential
leader
he
received
in
williamsburg
he
had
met
patrick
henry
in
hanover
county
more
than
five
years
earlier
this
was
at
the
hospitable
home
of
captain
nathaniel
west
dandridge
he
said
during
the
christmas
holidays
before
he
entered
college
he
was
not
yet
seventeen
and
henry
was
not
yet
twenty
four
the
period
of
their
association
was
about
two
weeks
amid
the
festivities
of
the
season
and
the
younger
of
them
afterwards
reflected
that
the
elder
engaged
in
no
conversation
which
might
have
given
the
measure
of
his
information
or
of
his
mind
after
jefferson
had
been
exposed
to
small
wythe
and
fauquier
however
it
became
evident
to
him
that
henry
was
no
man
of
science
and
learning
to
jefferson
his
passion
seemed
to
be
for
fiddling
dancing
and
pleasantry
in
the
last
of
which
he
particularly
excelled
though
he
was
solemnity
itself
in
public
his
manners
had
something
of
the
coarseness
of
the
poor
hunters
with
whom
he
loved
to
pursue
deer
in
the
piney
woods
and
to
crack
jokes
around
the
campfire
he
was
no
fashionable
gentleman
though
his
lineage
was
reputable
he
was
one
who
was
instinctively
attracted
to
people
of
the
common
sort
both
as
a
fiddler
and
as
a
statesman
he
played
by
ear
and
jefferson
himself
was
among
the
many
whom
he
charmed
during
the
spring
following
their
first
meeting
henry
took
his
examination
for
the
bar
in
williamsburg
when
after
six
weeks
of
study
he
was
passed
by
a
learned
board
under
circumstances
which
have
led
to
considerable
historical
dispute
the
severity
of
jefferson
s
later
comments
on
henry
s
legal
learning
when
the
latter
s
biographer
asked
him
about
the
orator
have
been
attributed
by
some
writers
to
the
alienation
between
the
two
men
which
occurred
toward
the
end
of
the
revolution
the
most
serious
of
his
criticisms
however
can
be
explained
on
equally
human
but
less
political
grounds
he
referred
a
number
of
times
to
henry
s
laziness
and
lack
of
precise
information
while
recognizing
his
great
public
services
and
his
imaginative
genius
the
contrast
between
his
own
painstaking
preparation
for
the
bar
and
henry
s
casual
knowledge
of
the
law
when
first
examined
could
hardly
have
failed
to
strike
him
while
he
was
favored
by
circumstances
at
the
outset
of
his
career
to
a
much
greater
degree
than
henry
he
gained
his
professional
position
chiefly
by
hard
work
while
his
less
learned
contemporary
attained
fame
as
a
jury
lawyer
almost
at
a
bound
jefferson
had
the
scholar
s
contempt
for
shortcuts
and
his
own
talent
was
of
another
sort
he
probably
thought
little
about
the
intellectual
limitations
of
patrick
henry
however
when
the
latter
called
on
him
in
the
spring
that
he
became
seventeen
or
even
when
as
a
practising
lawyer
the
orator
regularly
stopped
with
him
in
williamsburg
if
he
afterwards
questioned
the
possibility
of
henry
s
ever
having
read
livy
or
any
other
book
more
than
once
at
the
outset
he
was
probably
attracted
by
the
engaging
personality
and
was
undoubtedly
impressed
by
the
native
genius
of
the
man
more
than
any
other
prominent
leader
in
the
province
henry
sensed
the
feelings
of
the
inarticulate
and
appealed
to
the
unformed
west
whence
jefferson
himself
had
sprung
for
intellectual
stimulus
and
cultivated
conversation
the
law
student
went
elsewhere
but
he
gained
the
most
important
of
his
early
political
impressions
from
the
self
taught
lawyer
who
spoke
at
the
capitol
against
the
stamp
act
as
jefferson
had
never
heard
man
speak
before
this
was
on
thursday
may
when
he
was
twenty
two
if
the
dull
monotony
of
a
colonial
subservience
of
which
he
afterwards
complained
was
not
broken
at
this
time
it
was
sharply
punctuated
the
public
character
of
virginians
at
this
date
was
hardly
one
of
subservience
to
the
mother
country
a
traveler
who
had
come
that
way
in
fauquier
s
time
remarked
they
are
haughty
and
jealous
of
their
liberties
impatient
of
restraint
and
can
scarcely
bear
the
thought
of
being
controlled
by
any
superior
power
on
the
other
hand
this
visitor
also
reported
that
they
never
refused
necessary
supplies
to
the
government
when
called
upon
and
that
they
were
characteristically
a
loyal
and
generous
people
both
loyalty
and
jealous
independence
of
spirit
had
marked
the
previous
discussion
of
the
stamp
tax
and
of
this
young
jefferson
had
heard
his
teacher
george
wythe
had
played
a
part
in
the
actions
of
the
assembly
in
the
previous
fall
when
an
address
was
dispatched
to
the
king
and
memorials
were
sent
to
the
lords
and
commons
protesting
against
the
proposed
internal
tax
on
both
practical
and
constitutional
grounds
wythe
drew
a
draft
of
one
of
these
papers
but
as
he
told
jefferson
it
was
toned
down
by
his
colleagues
on
the
committee
presumably
on
the
advice
of
fauquier
the
subject
matter
of
these
dignified
documents
as
the
governor
aptly
said
was
praying
to
be
permitted
to
tax
themselves
there
had
been
no
response
to
the
prayer
however
and
in
the
spring
of
the
notorious
act
had
been
passed
by
parliament
and
assented
to
by
the
king
though
it
was
not
to
go
into
effect
until
the
following
november
neither
the
governor
nor
the
local
leaders
seem
to
have
expected
any
action
on
this
question
at
the
may
session
of
the
assembly
the
business
was
nearly
done
and
all
but
a
third
of
the
burgesses
had
gone
home
when
a
new
member
took
the
veterans
by
surprise
jefferson
probably
heard
that
his
friend
from
hanover
had
presented
to
the
committee
of
the
whole
on
wednesday
certain
resolutions
which
would
be
debated
next
day
he
may
not
have
learned
that
they
got
into
the
mails
in
advance
of
final
action
they
aroused
heated
comment
as
far
away
as
boston
and
sounded
the
alarm
bell
of
the
american
revolution
if
any
single
writing
did
jefferson
could
not
fail
to
hear
it
for
he
was
near
by
there
was
then
no
gallery
in
the
capitol
so
he
took
his
stand
on
that
thursday
between
the
lobby
and
the
burgess
chamber
along
with
his
younger
friend
john
tyler
who
was
still
studying
law
with
robert
carter
nicholas
here
they
heard
patrick
henry
make
a
speech
in
which
he
mentioned
caesar
and
brutus
charles
i
and
cromwell
and
uttered
the
name
of
george
iii
as
they
remembered
it
half
a
century
afterwards
he
was
then
stopped
with
cries
of
treason
and
extricated
himself
from
a
predicament
by
adding
that
this
monarch
might
profit
from
example
a
contemporary
account
gives
a
milder
version
of
the
famous
passage
but
a
minor
lapse
of
memory
on
the
part
of
two
old
men
who
had
heard
the
traditional
version
in
the
meantime
would
be
quite
forgivable
jefferson
also
said
that
frequently
when
listening
to
henry
he
closed
his
eyes
and
afterwards
was
unable
to
remember
a
single
word
in
the
torrent
of
sublime
oratory
he
could
not
distinguish
waves
of
the
indelible
emotional
impression
that
this
speech
made
on
him
however
there
can
be
no
question
whether
or
not
anybody
accused
henry
of
treason
the
responsible
leaders
of
the
colony
were
unwilling
to
go
quite
so
far
in
formal
action
as
he
desired
like
the
governor
jefferson
reported
that
the
resolutions
were
opposed
by
speaker
john
robinson
peyton
randolph
and
george
wythe
and
he
added
the
names
of
pendleton
and
bland
their
ground
was
that
the
same
principles
had
been
set
forth
in
the
still
unanswered
address
and
memorial
of
the
previous
session
and
that
the
latter
were
more
likely
to
be
effective
because
of
their
more
conciliatory
tone
in
their
judgment
the
question
was
essentially
one
of
method
if
not
one
of
manners
henry
was
bolder
than
they
had
been
for
he
attacked
the
stamp
act
after
its
passage
rather
than
before
and
his
audacity
had
its
reward
the
members
of
the
ruling
group
were
reluctant
to
yield
any
part
of
their
leadership
to
one
whom
they
regarded
as
a
rash
upstart
but
it
is
a
measure
of
their
political
wisdom
that
most
of
them
accepted
him
before
long
two
of
the
resolutions
were
either
defeated
or
withheld
on
the
day
that
henry
made
his
speech
though
both
of
them
got
into
the
papers
elsewhere
another
was
passed
by
a
single
vote
this
boldly
asserted
the
exclusive
right
of
the
assembly
to
lay
taxes
and
stated
that
every
attempt
to
vest
such
power
in
any
other
person
or
persons
whatsoever
had
a
manifest
tendency
to
destroy
both
british
and
american
freedom
jefferson
regarded
it
as
the
strongest
of
them
all
and
said
that
the
debate
on
it
was
most
bloody
it
was
after
the
passage
of
this
resolution
that
he
heard
portly
peyton
randolph
say
as
he
came
puffing
out
of
the
door
by
god
i
would
have
given
one
hundred
guineas
for
a
single
vote
on
the
next
day
before
the
burgesses
met
the
young
law
student
stood
at
the
end
of
the
clerk
s
table
and
watched
colonel
peter
randolph
then
a
member
of
the
council
thumb
over
the
volumes
of
the
journal
trying
to
find
a
precedent
for
the
expunging
of
a
vote
he
could
not
recall
whether
his
former
guardian
found
the
erasure
he
was
looking
for
but
he
noted
that
soon
afterwards
a
motion
was
carried
to
expunge
according
to
the
governor
there
had
happened
a
small
alteration
in
the
house
the
fact
was
that
patrick
henry
thinking
his
work
was
done
had
put
on
his
buckskin
breeches
mounted
his
lean
horse
and
set
out
for
home
jefferson
also
reported
that
there
was
a
change
of
heart
on
the
part
of
some
of
the
timid
members
by
implication
he
afterwards
approved
of
the
expunged
resolution
and
sympathized
with
the
young
hot
and
giddy
members
as
fauquier
described
them
the
four
resolutions
which
were
passed
said
quite
enough
about
the
taxation
of
the
people
by
their
own
representatives
and
about
the
established
practice
of
colonial
self
government
to
put
virginia
clearly
on
record
and
his
law
teacher
who
was
so
intimate
with
the
governor
thought
that
even
this
reiterated
statement
was
unnecessary
at
the
time
we
cannot
be
sure
that
jefferson
disagreed
with
wythe
and
fauquier
at
twenty
two
but
his
later
comments
imply
that
he
was
no
more
appalled
by
the
alleged
rashness
of
henry
s
course
then
than
he
was
afterwards
reviewing
the
matter
in
old
age
he
spoke
of
the
exact
conformity
of
their
opinions
also
he
noted
that
the
resolutions
were
supported
chiefly
by
the
vote
of
the
middle
and
upper
country
the
implications
of
this
observation
were
later
revealed
in
his
own
political
career
he
may
not
have
witnessed
the
stirring
incident
which
occurred
in
the
following
october
when
the
stamps
arrived
in
williamsburg
but
he
was
there
that
month
and
could
hardly
have
escaped
hearing
about
it
for
the
hero
was
his
friend
the
governor
though
fauquier
had
regretted
the
action
of
patrick
henry
in
may
he
realized
that
opposition
to
the
stamp
act
had
crystallized
since
that
time
and
obviously
regarded
the
measure
as
unenforceable
the
actual
presence
of
colonel
mercer
with
the
stamps
constituted
an
embarrassment
and
placed
him
in
a
situation
requiring
more
circumspection
he
said
than
he
had
ever
before
displayed
going
to
the
coffee
house
beyond
the
capitol
he
was
sitting
on
the
porch
with
the
speaker
and
several
members
of
the
council
when
colonel
mercer
came
thither
falsehood
by
a
crowd
which
fauquier
would
have
called
a
mob
had
he
not
known
the
gentlemen
of
property
who
composed
it
he
described
the
subsequent
events
in
a
colorful
letter
to
the
board
of
trade
i
immediately
heard
a
cry
see
the
governor
take
care
of
him
those
who
were
pushing
up
the
steps
immediately
fell
i
back
and
left
a
small
space
between
me
and
them
if
your
lordships
will
not
accuse
me
of
vanity
i
would
say
that
i
believe
this
to
be
partly
owing
to
the
respect
they
bore
to
my
character
and
partly
to
the
love
they
bore
my
person
soon
afterwards
he
and
mercer
walked
side
by
side
through
the
thickest
of
the
people
there
were
some
little
murmurs
but
they
were
not
molested
mercer
shortly
resigned
and
perhaps
the
honors
were
no
more
than
even
but
fauquier
had
maintained
public
order
and
his
own
prestige
there
was
no
such
violence
here
as
there
had
been
a
few
weeks
earlier
in
boston
where
the
house
of
lieutenant
governor
thomas
hutchins
on
was
destroyed
and
his
valuable
books
and
papers
were
scattered
in
the
street
mobs
could
not
be
assembled
so
readily
in
this
agricultural
province
as
in
a
seaport
city
and
leadership
here
was
retained
by
the
genteel
group
also
until
lord
dunmore
appeared
on
the
eve
of
the
revolution
the
province
of
virginia
was
fortunate
in
its
governors
fauquier
and
his
immediate
successor
lord
botetourt
were
more
tactful
and
judicious
than
sir
francis
bernard
and
thomas
hutchins
on
it
was
not
from
them
that
young
jefferson
gained
the
low
impression
that
he
afterwards
held
of
the
manners
of
british
officials
so
far
as
imperial
relations
were
concerned
from
the
time
of
the
struggle
over
the
stamp
act
onward
he
was
more
impressed
with
the
agreement
of
the
political
leaders
of
virginia
than
by
their
differences
of
opinion
he
always
credited
patrick
henry
with
giving
the
first
impulse
to
the
ball
of
revolution
there
and
in
all
his
later
statements
he
manifested
his
own
sympathy
with
him
and
the
bolder
spirits
including
the
lees
he
believed
that
a
new
political
alignment
was
created
as
a
result
of
the
increased
prominence
of
this
group
factional
rivalries
probably
played
a
considerable
part
in
these
early
struggles
the
change
was
symbolized
by
the
discrediting
of
speaker
john
robinson
who
was
also
treasurer
of
the
colony
and
the
central
figure
among
the
dominant
leaders
when
he
passed
from
the
political
scene
in
the
year
before
jefferson
was
admitted
to
the
bar
and
three
years
before
he
became
a
burgess
a
new
period
began
though
at
first
the
differences
from
the
old
one
were
not
startling
robinson
was
involved
in
dubious
financial
transactions
which
patrick
henry
and
richard
henry
lee
suspected
and
which
jefferson
afterwards
condemned
though
he
was
gentle
towards
the
man
himself
in
a
time
of
financial
difficulty
following
the
french
and
indian
war
robinson
as
treasurer
had
re
emitted
redeemed
treasury
notes
and
accepted
the
paper
of
various
individuals
in
return
expecting
that
this
would
be
redeemed
before
the
time
when
the
notes
had
to
be
destroyed
he
was
also
charged
with
attempting
to
cover
his
transactions
by
setting
up
a
loan
office
henry
without
realizing
the
full
implications
of
the
proposal
but
scenting
scandal
attacked
it
boldly
in
the
house
of
burgesses
and
uttered
one
exclamation
which
jefferson
never
forgot
it
had
been
urged
said
jefferson
that
from
certain
unhappy
circumstances
of
the
colony
men
of
substantial
property
had
contracted
debts
which
if
exacted
suddenly
must
ruin
them
and
their
families
but
with
a
little
indulgence
of
time
might
be
paid
with
ease
then
as
he
remembered
patrick
henry
said
what
sir
is
it
proposed
then
to
reclaim
the
spendthrift
from
his
dissipation
and
extravagance
by
filling
his
pockets
with
money
the
proposal
was
killed
by
the
council
not
by
the
burgesses
as
jefferson
recalled
and
his
memory
may
have
been
otherwise
at
fault
again
he
said
that
henry
was
supported
by
the
members
from
the
upper
counties
and
that
only
an
aristocratic
minority
was
opposed
after
the
death
of
robinson
in
his
private
loans
from
public
funds
were
discovered
and
insofar
as
proved
necessary
these
were
charged
against
his
estate
the
names
of
his
beneficiaries
were
not
revealed
though
some
prominent
planters
have
been
strongly
suspected
the
fact
that
colonel
peter
randolph
and
edmund
pendleton
were
among
the
executors
of
robinson
s
will
need
not
imply
that
they
were
personally
involved
but
it
does
suggest
where
their
political
sympathies
lay
the
immediate
result
was
the
separation
of
the
offices
of
speaker
and
treasurer
as
fauquier
had
advised
peyton
randolph
assuming
the
one
and
robert
carter
nicholas
the
other
both
of
these
older
men
were
in
office
when
jefferson
entered
public
life
and
he
never
questioned
their
complete
integrity
patrick
henry
was
now
established
as
a
man
of
prominence
but
he
did
not
dominate
the
scene
in
policy
though
not
in
social
intercourse
jefferson
was
to
be
more
closely
identified
with
him
and
with
richard
henry
lee
than
with
the
still
powerful
remnants
of
the
old
ruling
group
not
until
afterwards
did
he
speak
disparagingly
of
the
aristocracy
or
even
condemn
extravagance
and
debt
but
by
this
early
date
some
seeds
of
doubt
had
fallen
into
his
retentive
mind
in
order
to
complete
the
story
of
fauquier
we
must
anticipate
somewhat
the
amiable
governor
whose
chief
fault
was
his
love
of
gaming
and
who
may
also
have
erred
on
the
side
of
magnificence
was
still
in
office
when
jefferson
began
to
appear
in
before
the
general
court
but
when
his
young
friend
entered
the
house
of
burgesses
two
years
later
he
had
passed
forever
from
the
scene
after
a
tedious
illness
which
he
bore
with
patience
and
fortitude
fauquier
died
at
the
palace
in
march
at
the
age
of
sixty
five
until
the
end
he
continued
to
be
a
friend
to
scientific
inquiry
for
he
prescribed
in
his
will
that
if
he
should
die
from
any
disease
of
which
the
physicians
did
not
know
the
cause
his
body
might
be
opened
also
he
strikingly
revealed
his
humanitarian
spirit
regretting
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
sell
his
slaves
he
specifically
enjoined
that
the
women
and
children
should
not
be
separated
that
his
former
servants
should
be
allowed
to
choose
their
own
new
masters
and
that
they
were
then
to
be
sold
to
those
chosen
masters
at
a
considerable
discount
from
the
market
price
jefferson
was
not
among
the
principal
gentlemen
who
were
present
when
the
unviolated
body
of
fauquier
was
laid
to
rest
in
bruton
church
for
he
was
then
in
albemarle
planting
his
garden
and
preparing
to
start
out
on
a
circuit
of
county
courts
but
when
he
got
to
williamsburg
a
little
later
he
undoubtedly
heard
full
details
from
george
wythe
who
was
one
of
the
executors
of
the
late
governor
s
american
estate
as
a
subscriber
to
the
virginia
gazette
also
he
could
hardly
have
failed
to
read
and
approve
the
lines
which
soon
appeared
there
if
ever

a
noble
conquest
made
twas
when
fauquier
the
debt
of
nature
paid
jefferson
regarded
him
as
the
best
of
governors
but
he
owed
a
greater
political
debt
to
patrick
henry
fauquier
had
done
most
for
him
in
helping
him
cultivate
his
tastes
and
expand
the
horizons
of
his
mind
viii
disciple
of
enlightenment
a
year
after
he
heard
patrick
henry
declaim
against
the
stamp
act
at
the
capitol
jefferson
left
his
province
for
the
first
time
and
ventured
farther
from
home
than
he
did
again
until
after
the
american
revolution
beginning
in
may
when
he
was
twenty
three
he
made
a
journey
of
about
three
months
to
annapolis
philadelphia
and
new
york
returning
to
virginia
by
water
this
was
his
nearest
approach
to
a
grand
tour
such
as
young
english
gentlemen
made
at
the
close
of
their
formal
schooling
he
continued
his
preparations
for
the
bar
for
several
months
longer
and
he
never
ceased
to
be
a
student
but
this
trip
besides
being
an
educational
experience
in
itself
marked
with
some
precision
the
end
of
his
years
of
tutelage
he
made
the
trip
alone
though
he
had
not
expected
to
he
had
counted
on
the
lively
companionship
of
frank
willis
of
gloucester
county
willis
had
played
disconcerting
practical
jokes
on
him
and
john
tyler
when
they
were
reading
law
in
williamsburg
such
as
overturning
the
table
or
carrying
off
their
lawbooks
but
he
found
willis
entertaining
when
he
himself
was
not
studying
this
waggish
young
man
had
to
start
earlier
however
and
jefferson
had
no
company
but
his
own
thoughts
as
he
drove
to
annapolis
in
a
one
horse
chair
on
the
way
he
was
nearly
spilled
into
a
stream
when
fording
it
and
had
other
minor
misadventures
the
account
of
them
which
he
sent
john
page
shows
that
he
was
not
wholly
devoid
of
humor
and
his
comments
on
the
capital
of
maryland
show
that
he
was
keeping
his
eyes
open
observing
the
lower
house
of
the
assembly
in
session
he
was
sharply
critical
of
its
procedure
remarking
that
it
was
little
better
than
a
mob
the
members
addressed
the
speaker
without
rising
from
their
seats
and
he
put
the
question
most
casually
not
bothering
to
call
for
a
division
the
young
visitor
reflected
that
there
was
more
decorum
in
the
house
of
burgesses
he
was
struck
by
the
beautiful
situation
of
annapolis
however
and
he
must
have
concluded
that
the
economy
of
maryland
was
much
like
that
of
virginia
tobacco
being
the
chief
thing
attended
to
in
both
of
them
he
witnessed
the
celebration
of
the
repeal
of
the
stamp
act
and
to
him
this
was
probably
the
first
notable
sign
of
the
community
of
colonial
interest
as
he
drove
onward
through
delaware
and
into
pennsylvania
he
saw
cultivated
country
which
was
very
different
from
the
tidewater
of
virginia
and
the
heavily
forested
piedmont
of
his
youth
the
land
beyond
newcastle
was
beautifully
laid
out
in
fields
of
clover
grain
and
flax
crops
like
these
he
afterwards
encouraged
in
albemarle
along
with
orchards
like
the
luxuriant
ones
he
now
saw
and
he
must
have
found
this
part
of
his
journey
wholly
pleasing
philadelphia
could
hardly
have
failed
to
arouse
his
wonderment
there
was
no
such
city
in
virginia
or
anywhere
else
in
the
colonies
for
that
matter
it
had
between
eighteen
and
twenty
thousand
people
and
it
stretched
for
almost
two
miles
along
the
delaware
he
probably
noticed
that
the
people
were
frugal
and
industrious
and
he
may
have
observed
as
another
did
that
they
were
not
remarkably
courteous
and
hospitable
to
strangers
unless
particularly
recommended
to
them
however
he
had
at
least
one
letter
of
introduction
and
he
may
have
had
more
this
had
been
given
him
by
dr
george
gilmer
nephew
of
his
albemarle
neighbor
dr
thomas
walker
who
had
recently
returned
from
the
university
of
edinburgh
and
was
then
living
in
williamsburg
it
was
addressed
to
dr
john
morgan
who
was
already
on
the
road
to
eminence
in
philadelphia
gilmer
had
known
morgan
in
edinburgh
and
was
confident
that
his
penetrating
genius
would
soon
discern
that
jefferson
was
a
young
gentleman
eminently
worthy
of
his
acquaintance
nothing
was
said
here
about
the
latter
s
purpose
in
coming
to
the
metropolis
this
was
to
receive
inoculation
against
smallpox
and
it
seems
more
likely
that
dr
william
shippen
junior
gave
it
whoever
the
officiating
physician
may
have
been
the
fact
that
jefferson
was
inoculated
is
noteworthy
for
this
enables
us
to
place
him
somewhat
more
precisely
in
the
history
of
advancing
science
and
to
judge
of
the
progress
of
his
expanding
mind
agricultural
virginia
was
relatively
free
from
smallpox
but
the
scourge
had
appeared
there
in
his
time
the
method
of
inoculation
sometimes
described
as
variolation
had
been
introduced
into
the
massachusetts
bay
colony
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
century
but
in
boston
it
had
met
with
opposition
which
went
to
the
extremes
of
mob
violence
and
it
had
been
officially
prohibited
in
new
york
it
had
been
only
occasionally
resorted
to
in
virginia
up
to
this
time
and
the
general
belief
there
was
that
it
served
to
spread
rather
than
to
prevent
the
disease
the
mortality
from
this
crude
form
of
inoculation
was
considerable
and
a
much
better
method
jennerian
vaccination
was
to
come
but
young
jefferson
who
made
a
point
of
divesting
his
mind
of
prejudice
and
of
forming
independent
judgments
decided
to
run
the
risk
he
appears
to
have
suffered
no
ill
effects
from
taking
his
stand
with
the
medical
pioneers
and
in
his
efforts
to
prevent
this
dread
disease
he
remained
for
a
generation
in
the
vanguard
another
and
less
significant
detail
of
information
about
his
first
trip
outside
of
his
own
region
has
been
preserved
in
new
york
he
chanced
to
take
lodgings
at
the
same
place
with
elbridge
gerry
of
massachusetts
then
four
years
out
of
harvard
they
were
to
meet
again
in
the
continental
congress
and
to
be
associated
in
the
bitter
partisan
struggles
of
still
later
years
against
the
federalists
at
this
time
however
no
one
would
have
been
likely
to
think
of
jefferson
as
an
embryonic
politician
in
the
sense
that
we
use
the
term
today
it
would
have
been
agreed
by
competent
observers
that
he
was
admirably
prepared
to
assume
the
public
role
which
was
traditional
in
his
class
but
this
did
not
necessarily
involve
agitation
or
political
manipulation
and
to
those
who
knew
him
best
he
must
have
seemed
most
distinctive
in
the
diversity
of
his
interests
and
the
universality
of
his
spirit
he
had
not
traveled
far
as
yet
but
he
was
already
a
citizen
of
the
world
in
his
own
mind
and
he
placed
his
trust
not
in
temporal
powers
but
in
liberated
intelligence
there
is
no
certain
way
of
knowing
just
when
this
apostle
of
freedom
first
swore
eternal
hostility
against
every
form
of
tyranny
over
the
mind
of
man
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
by
this
time
he
was
bold
as
well
as
active
in
pursuit
of
knowledge
there
is
little
question
that
before
he
stepped
on
the
public
stage
he
had
arrived
at
his
abiding
conviction
that
human
intelligence
can
unlock
not
only
the
treasure
house
of
the
past
but
also
the
secrets
of
the
universe
thus
leading
mankind
onward
to
a
richer
and
better
life
and
that
he
personally
was
proceeding
on
that
assumption
he
did
not
need
to
express
in
so
many
words
his
belief
in
the
mind
until
somebody
combated
it
or
until
it
appeared
that
some
obstacle
to
its
freedom
must
be
overthrown
this
faith
was
so
essential
a
part
of
his
own
spiritual
nature
and
of
the
framework
of
ideas
within
which
he
operated
that
he
generally
took
it
for
granted
it
was
in
the
air
that
his
spirit
breathed
it
was
a
major
element
in
the
intellectual
climate
in
which
he
chose
to
dwell
that
climate
was
not
virginian
though
many
of
his
countrymen
basked
in
its
warmth
as
he
did
it
was
not
american
though
it
prevailed
in
important
quarters
on
this
continent
while
he
was
growing
up
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
it
was
chiefly
english
in
its
origins
but
it
had
become
international
it
was
the
climate
of
opinion
or
the
cluster
of
ideas
or
the
pattern
of
thought
which
is
commonly
described
as
the
enlightenment
if
we
must
date
the
great
intellectual
revolution
of
which
he
so
gladly
made
himself
an
heir
it
began
with
sir
isaac
newton
and
john
locke
whom
he
included
with
lord
bacon
in
his
trinity
of
immortals
it
had
spread
through
widening
circles
of
select
spirits
in
england
and
on
the
continent
and
by
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
it
was
well
represented
among
the
colonial
intelligentsia
most
notably
by
benjamin
franklin
to
whom
he
was
a
successor
in
more
ways
than
one
jefferson
did
not
introduce
the
enlightenment
into
the
colonies
but
he
became
its
almost
perfect
embodiment
and
after
franklin
its
most
conspicuous
apostle
on
his
side
of
the
atlantic
to
its
major
tenets
he
always
clung
among
the
most
important
of
these
was
the
belief
that
the
mind
of
man
had
emerged
from
shackles
and
darkness
and
had
launched
itself
upon
a
limitless
career
of
intellectual
conquest
by
accepting
this
he
by
no
means
severed
all
links
with
the
past
but
he
did
become
pre
eminently
forward
looking
like
his
kindred
spirits
he
adopted
certain
confident
hypotheses
about
universal
natural
law
and
natural
rights
and
with
these
an
attitude
of
hostility
to
arbitrary
power
of
any
sort
a
belief
in
the
vast
improvability
if
not
the
perfectibility
of
man
and
an
impulse
toward
humanitarianism
to
jefferson
this
was
not
a
body
of
cold
doctrine
but
of
liberal
and
expanded
thought
it
was
a
warm
and
moving
gospel
the
full
implications
of
this
living
faith
will
appear
only
in
the
unfolding
of
his
story
but
since
he
had
to
become
a
disciple
before
he
could
stand
forth
as
an
apostle
a
question
which
may
already
have
been
answered
in
general
terms
should
now
be
raised
specifically
how
did
the
influence
of
the
enlightenment
reach
him
in
the
forests
of
virginia
the
chief
personal
impact
upon
his
receptive
mind
came
from
the
williamsburg
trio
small
fauquier
and
wythe
they
anticipated
the
greater
trinity
of
newton
locke
and
bacon
william
small
acquainted
him
more
familiarly
with
sir
isaac
newton
and
opened
before
his
eyes
the
vistas
of
an
ordered
universe
this
mathematician
and
natural
philosopher
may
not
have
talked
often
with
his
eager
pupil
about
the
dignity
of
human
nature
since
he
doubtless
assumed
it
but
first
among
jefferson
s
teachers
he
showed
him
what
the
mind
can
do
francis
fauquier
who
kept
charts
of
the
temperature
discussed
philosophical
matters
at
his
generous
table
and
provided
so
solicitously
for
the
future
of
his
slaves
represented
the
enlightenment
in
its
humanitarian
as
well
as
its
scientific
aspects
george
wythe
as
a
classicist
belonged
more
to
the
past
than
either
of
the
others
but
the
study
of
the
greek
and
latin
masters
had
served
to
enrich
and
liberalize
his
mind
not
to
enslave
it
and
throughout
life
he
was
notably
humane
it
may
be
assumed
that
he
and
both
the
other
men
were
familiar
with
john
locke
whose
general
ideas
were
so
well
known
at
this
time
and
in
this
place
that
they
might
almost
be
taken
for
granted
along
with
those
of
newton
young
jefferson
however
was
now
less
interested
in
political
theory
than
he
was
in
general
learning
and
he
appears
not
inappropriately
to
have
made
obeisance
to
bacon
first
before
he
set
out
for
annapolis
he
had
in
his
possession
at
least
one
of
bacon
s
books
jefferson
eventually
followed
the
path
of
free
inquiry
further
than
any
of
his
local
contemporaries
and
he
gathered
richer
fruits
as
he
went
along
but
the
general
spirit
of
the
leaders
among
his
countrymen
was
not
uncongenial
with
his
own
at
a
later
time
he
found
some
of
the
large
planters
conservative
in
political
and
economic
questions
as
guardians
of
their
own
interests
but
the
greatest
of
them
were
men
of
large
affairs
in
touch
with
the
european
world
and
affected
by
its
major
currents
of
thought
the
anglican
clergy
may
have
lacked
spirituality
as
the
evangelicals
claimed
and
unquestionably
they
struggled
to
maintain
their
special
privileges
but
they
were
not
otherworldly
and
there
were
strong
traces
of
rationalism
among
them
if
his
contemporaries
wondered
about
young
jefferson
in
these
and
the
next
few
years
it
was
not
so
much
because
of
the
way
he
was
going
as
because
they
questioned
the
wisdom
of
anybody
s
going
so
far
the
zest
with
which
he
embarked
on
intellectual
pursuits
was
similar
to
that
shown
by
other
enlightened
spirits
but
it
was
manifested
by
him
to
such
a
marked
degree
as
to
be
characteristically
individual
the
habits
of
unremitting
study
which
he
had
formed
by
his
college
days
and
which
he
ever
afterwards
maintained
are
not
to
be
thought
of
primarily
as
the
expression
of
a
stern
sense
of
duty
no
calvinist
in
new
england
could
have
been
more
rigorous
in
self
discipline
than
he
was
but
the
supremely
significant
fact
about
his
lifelong
quest
of
knowledge
is
that
he
found
in
it
infinite
delight
he
always
loved
to
study
for
by
this
means
he
expanded
the
horizons
of
his
mind
and
gained
the
power
of
knowledge
which
was
the
only
power
he
really
craved
jefferson
had
begun
to
visit
the
office
of
the
virginia
gazette
in
williamsburg
and
to
buy
books
there
during
his
years
as
a
law
student
at
a
later
time
not
even
he
could
have
read
all
the
volumes
in
his
library
but
he
probably
read
everything
he
bought
in
these
years
accordingly
his
fugitive
early
book
lists
assume
disproportionate
importance
still
more
can
be
learned
about
his
early
tastes
from
the
notebooks
he
kept
into
these
he
copied
extracts
from
the
authors
he
read
and
together
with
a
few
surviving
letters
from
his
young
manhood
and
scattered
references
in
later
writings
they
provide
the
best
available
clues
to
his
early
thought
the
notebook
which
has
been
termed
his
literary
bible
and
which
he
began
to
keep
when
he
was
about
twenty
one
is
particularly
valuable
the
classical
writers
engaged
him
most
at
first
despite
the
impulse
toward
natural
philosophy
which
william
small
gave
him
they
constituted
a
rich
source
of
delight
to
him
throughout
life
and
were
the
chosen
companions
of
his
old
age
from
his
days
in
maury
s
school
latin
was
a
ready
instrument
and
he
found
this
language
most
useful
in
making
himself
a
scholar
in
the
law
as
for
greek
he
read
homer
in
pope
s
translation
to
begin
with
then
under
the
inspiration
of
wythe
he
turned
to
the
original
which
he
ever
afterwards
preferred
he
read
euripides
at
this
time
but
apparently
not
aeschylus
he
never
cared
for
plato
and
with
aristotle
he
seems
not
to
have
concerned
himself
at
all
he
was
acquainted
with
the
latin
poets
especially
virgil
and
he
valued
the
maxims
of
seneca
and
the
republican
moralities
of
cicero
like
most
other
people
he
was
more
imaginative
in
his
early
years
than
he
was
afterwards
he
was
sensitive
to
the
niceties
of
words
as
well
as
to
natural
beauty
and
at
this
stage
he
was
fond
of
english
poetry
he
read
a
great
deal
of
it
but
in
this
field
he
appears
to
have
been
relatively
conventional
and
easily
pleased
he
bought
the
works
of
milton
before
he
was
twenty
one
and
he
copied
numerous
extracts
from
him
in
his
notebook
including
diatribes
against
women
from
paradise
lost
he
afterwards
recommended
to
the
young
that
they
read
the
best
of
the
poets
and
he
himself
was
familiar
with
the
older
masters
and
almost
the
whole
of
the
eighteenth
century
group
for
a
time
he
kept
up
with
literary
fashion
and
his
knowledge
of
english
verse
was
more
than
superficial
but
he
never
regarded
himself
as
a
man
of
happy
imagination
and
poetic
fancy
he
read
more
for
profit
than
pleasure
and
he
sought
no
avenue
of
escape
from
life
he
was
familiar
with
shakespeare
from
an
early
time
valuing
him
not
only
for
his
observation
of
human
nature
but
also
because
he
best
displayed
the
full
powers
of
the
english
language
he
was
acquainted
with
current
english
drama
and
rarely
missed
a
chance
to
attend
the
theater
in
williamsburg
for
nondramatic
fiction
he
cared
little
his
earliest
favorite
among
the
writers
in
this
field
was
laurence
sterne
whom
he
long
chuckled
over
in
jefferson
himself
however
little
humor
had
appeared
as
yet
except
in
the
form
of
elaborate
exaggeration
he
was
particularly
fond
of
history
but
his
interest
in
this
subject
was
probably
greatest
after
he
became
a
public
man
like
other
disciples
of
the
enlightenment
he
was
aware
of
the
value
of
modern
languages
he
had
employed
french
from
the
beginning
of
his
study
of
the
law
and
he
soon
took
up
italian
perhaps
he
was
attracted
to
italian
in
the
first
place
because
it
was
the
source
of
musical
terms
before
long
he
also
found
that
it
had
contributed
richly
to
the
language
of
architecture
he
had
not
yet
tackled
spanish
and
he
said
regretfully
late
in
life
that
he
never
learned
german
he
had
a
distinct
flair
for
languages
but
modern
literature
meant
little
to
him
except
in
english
shortly
before
the
revolution
when
he
discovered
ossian
he
showed
interest
in
celtic
this
was
akin
to
his
enduring
interest
in
anglo
saxon
which
began
when
he
was
struggling
with
legal
terms
as
a
law
student
he
liked
to
trace
words
as
well
as
legal
and
political
institutions
to
their
sources
and
even
in
his
early
manhood
his
spirit
was
that
of
a
scholar
rather
than
a
literary
man
it
is
far
more
important
to
consider
the
predominant
purposes
of
this
omnivorous
young
man
than
it
is
to
draw
up
a
full
menu
of
his
reading
for
he
only
tasted
some
things
while
others
he
devoured
his
appetite
never
ceased
to
be
gargantuan
but
even
he
had
to
make
some
selection
and
he
did
this
not
in
the
fastidious
spirit
of
a
gourmet
but
in
the
mood
of
an
ambitious
workman
who
wanted
to
build
up
his
strength
he
greatly
desired
to
make
of
himself
a
cultivated
person
he
did
not
scorn
the
traditional
embellishments
of
genteel
life
and
he
loved
learning
and
the
arts
for
their
own
sake
but
as
one
who
lived
in
a
new
and
undeveloped
country
he
was
most
anxious
to
acquire
knowledge
that
was
useful
to
man
he
regarded
the
human
mind
not
as
a
toy
to
be
played
with
but
as
an
instrument
to
be
used
in
the
cause
of
progress
by
the
time
that
he
assumed
a
full
share
of
the
business
of
life
his
own
mind
was
unusually
well
equipped
for
the
accomplishment
of
practical
purposes
as
broadly
conceived
also
it
was
thoroughly
emancipated
as
he
properly
believed
it
had
to
be
before
it
could
be
fully
employed
we
might
be
tempted
to
believe
that
this
lifelong
champion
of
liberty
was
born
into
intellectual
freedom
in
some
ideal
state
of
nature
no
one
was
more
aware
than
he
however
that
customs
traditions
and
imperfect
human
institutions
impose
shackles
on
the
mind
and
he
himself
must
have
had
to
throw
off
some
of
these
the
records
of
his
inner
life
in
this
important
period
are
distressingly
incomplete
but
they
bear
traces
of
struggle
and
strongly
suggest
that
this
struggle
was
primarily
in
the
sphere
of
religion
and
morals
it
is
a
fair
assumption
that
the
first
major
obstacle
to
the
freedom
of
the
mind
which
he
clearly
perceived
was
the
doctrine
of
supernatural
revelation
and
that
after
he
had
rid
himself
of
this
the
major
intellectual
problem
of
his
young
manhood
was
that
of
finding
adequate
moral
sanction
elsewhere
his
general
manner
in
regard
to
religious
questions
throughout
life
was
one
of
reticence
since
he
regarded
these
as
a
private
concern
he
wrote
and
talked
about
them
very
little
as
he
did
about
intimate
personal
matters
of
other
sorts
he
has
left
no
diaries
comparable
with
those
of
the
adamses
wherein
he
revealed
his
secret
and
sacred
reflections
but
he
did
keep
notebooks
of
his
reading
and
his
literary
bible
is
specially
valuable
in
providing
clues
to
his
nonpolitical
thought
one
cannot
be
sure
of
course
that
he
accepted
all
the
sentiments
of
homer
euripides
and
cicero
of
shakespeare
milton
and
bolingbroke
that
he
copied
or
that
a
unified
philosophy
could
be
fabricated
from
all
these
fragments
in
certain
cases
however
later
comments
and
actions
show
the
quotations
to
have
been
extraordinarily
apt
thus
he
copied
this
sentence
from
lord
bolingbroke
no
hypothesis
ought
to
be
maintained
if
a
single
phenomenon
stands
in
direct
opposition
to
it
whether
or
not
under
the
inspiration
of
fauquier
he
learned
from
this
english
writer
to
apply
to
the
bible
and
theology
the
same
tests
as
to
secular
history
and
scientific
hypotheses
the
acceptability
of
this
dictum
to
him
is
obvious
in
the
light
of
what
he
said
later
urging
his
nephew
peter
carr
to
apply
critical
tests
to
the
new
testament
he
wrote
your
own
reason
is
the
only
oracle
given
to
you
by
heaven
and
you
are
answerable
not
for
the
rightness
but
uprightness
of
the
decision
he
certainly
did
not
regard
the
intelligence
of
any
single
human
being
as
infallible
but
he
saw
no
escape
from
the
obligation
to
employ
the
mind
fearlessly
in
every
field
he
concerned
himself
much
in
his
twenties
with
the
mysteries
of
death
and
immortality
in
the
year
that
he
became
president
of
the
united
states
replying
to
a
communication
about
the
transmigration
of
souls
he
had
this
to
say
about
the
country
of
spirits
when
i
was
young
i
was
fond
of
the
speculations
which
seemed
to
promise
some
insight
into
that
hidden
country
but
observing
at
length
that
they
left
me
in
the
same
ignorance
in
which
they
had
found
me
i
have
for
very
many
years
ceased
to
read
or
to
think
concerning
them
and
have
reposed
my
head
on
that
pillow
of
ignorance
which
a
benevolent
creator
has
made
so
soft
for
us
knowing
how
much
we
should
be
forced
to
use
it
during
his
inquiring
youth
and
young
manhood
he
did
not
find
the
answers
and
characteristically
he
addressed
himself
to
the
problems
of
this
world
which
reason
can
better
understand
on
the
other
hand
he
did
find
noble
and
inspiriting
maxims
and
examples
not
in
the
christian
scriptures
which
he
undervalued
at
this
stage
but
primarily
in
the
writings
of
classical
antiquity
and
out
of
these
he
evolved
a
working
philosophy
he
attached
himself
to
no
school
of
shallow
optimism
in
extract
after
extract
one
can
perceive
the
mood
of
disenchantment
as
in
this
one
from
pope
s
iliad
to
labour
is
the
lot
of
man
below
and
when
jove
gave
us
life
he
gave
us
woe
he
learned
from
the
greek
poets
not
to
expect
too
much
from
life
not
to
dream
of
a
chimerical
bliss
but
to
do
his
duty
without
expecting
to
be
rewarded
to
cultivate
his
friends
and
love
his
country
even
to
the
point
of
self
sacrifice
from
ancient
writers
he
learned
the
possibility
of
courageous
resignation
and
under
their
inspiration
he
worked
out
for
himself
a
program
which
was
little
short
of
the
heroic
allowance
must
be
made
for
the
period
in
his
life
when
he
recorded
these
somber
reflections
melancholy
was
not
characteristic
of
jefferson
in
his
ripe
maturity
his
temperament
was
then
notably
sanguine
the
extracts
which
he
copied
marked
an
early
and
passing
phase
he
had
a
disappointing
love
affair
in
his
early
twenties
and
soon
afterwards
lost
a
favorite
sister
he
was
not
wholly
at
ease
in
social
relationships
as
a
young
man
and
not
until
after
his
own
marriage
did
he
find
himself
as
a
domestic
being
it
was
at
the
beginning
of
this
period
of
imperfect
personal
adjustment
that
he
wrote
to
john
page
about
bearing
up
with
a
tolerable
degree
of
patience
under
this
burden
of
life
of
proceeding
with
a
pious
and
unshaken
resignation
and
of
arriving
at
such
a
philosophy
that
few
things
could
disturb
him
at
all
and
nothing
could
disturb
him
much
before
he
attained
domestic
happiness
he
had
probably
worked
out
his
enduring
philosophy
of
life
it
was
marked
by
cheerfulness
not
gloom
and
he
afterwards
described
it
as
epicurean
though
he
hastened
to
say
that
the
term
was
much
misunderstood
he
came
to
believe
that
happiness
was
the
end
of
life
but
as
has
been
said
he
was
engaged
by
the
peculiar
conjunction
of
duty
with
happiness
and
his
working
philosophy
was
a
sort
of
blend
of
epicureanism
and
stoicism
in
which
the
goal
of
happiness
was
attained
by
self
discipline
at
no
time
after
he
became
mature
did
he
emphasize
mere
amusement
or
pleasure
for
its
own
sake
this
was
true
in
the
arts
as
well
as
in
literature
thus
he
appears
as
an
exceedingly
serious
young
man
who
had
worked
things
out
in
his
own
mind
just
about
as
far
as
he
thought
they
could
be
worked
out
by
him
and
who
had
freed
himself
entirely
from
the
need
of
a
churchly
sanction
he
was
not
wholly
a
rationalist
however
and
he
did
feel
the
need
for
some
sort
of
authority
which
he
was
unwilling
to
concede
to
church
or
priest
this
he
found
within
an
individual
s
own
breast
in
the
conscience
which
he
regarded
as
a
special
moral
sense
as
truly
a
part
of
man
s
nature
as
his
sense
of
sight
or
hearing
his
arm
or
his
leg
how
early
he
reached
this
opinion
it
is
difficult
to
say
he
may
have
groped
for
a
time
in
a
dim
borderland
of
ethical
uncertainty
but
he
had
definitely
emerged
from
it
before
he
wrote
the
earliest
of
his
notable
public
papers
for
these
are
marked
by
a
burning
consciousness
of
moral
values
addressing
king
george
iii
in
he
said
the
great
principles
of
right
and
wrong
are
legible
to
every
reader
to
pursue
them
requires
not
the
aid
of
many
counsellors
the
issues
of
his
time
do
not
now
seem
that
simple
but
it
is
highly
significant
that
he
saw
them
not
merely
as
political
and
economic
but
as
moral
issues
and
that
they
aroused
his
righteous
indignation
he
was
certainly
not
immoral
though
some
lapses
might
have
been
expected
when
he
was
young
and
after
the
period
of
youthful
doubt
it
would
be
improper
to
term
him
irreligious
as
has
been
well
said
he
was
a
pious
man
if
the
religion
of
a
humane
morality
is
recognized
as
a
kind
of
natural
piety
but
unquestionably
he
was
secular
in
these
years
and
he
probably
would
not
have
called
himself
a
christian
at
some
time
before
the
american
revolution
he
copied
the
dictum
of
bolingbroke
that
the
teachings
of
christ
comprise
an
incomplete
body
of
ethics
and
that
a
system
collected
from
the
writings
of
the
ancient
heathen
moralists
would
be
more
full
more
entire
more
coherent
and
more
clearly
deduced
from
unquestionable
principles
of
knowledge
young
jefferson
may
not
have
wholly
agreed
with
the
english
writer
at
this
stage
and
in
the
ripeness
of
years
he
found
in
the
teachings
of
jesus
the
purest
system
of
morals
ever
before
preached
to
man
eventually
he
regarded
the
heathen
moralists
as
insufficient
even
in
his
old
age
however
he
was
fully
convinced
that
the
priests
protestant
as
well
as
catholic
had
adulterated
and
sophisticated
the
teachings
of
jesus
for
their
own
selfish
purposes
and
from
his
twenties
until
his
death
he
was
anticlerical
in
varying
degrees
of
bitterness
he
served
for
a
time
as
a
vestry
man
in
his
parish
as
a
leading
planter
was
supposed
to
do
he
continued
throughout
life
to
have
warm
personal
friends
among
the
enlightened
clergy
and
he
always
contributed
generously
to
local
churches
but
before
he
attacked
the
special
privileges
of
the
establishment
in
virginia
ecclesiastical
authority
and
traditional
theology
had
wholly
ceased
to
have
validity
for
him
the
right
to
complete
intellectual
and
religious
freedom
which
he
afterwards
championed
so
conspicuously
for
all
men
he
had
already
claimed
for
himself
the
business
of
life
ix
the
young
lawyer
jefferson
began
to
practise
law
before
he
reached
the
age
of
twenty
four
and
he
continued
to
do
so
for
seven
years
the
five
years
since
he
finished
college
had
not
been
employed
solely
in
preparation
for
his
profession
he
was
deliberately
fitting
himself
for
the
whole
of
life
as
he
expected
to
live
it
but
he
had
studied
law
with
the
utmost
seriousness
and
considering
the
time
he
had
spent
his
professional
career
was
short
in
the
light
of
the
generation
of
conspicuous
public
service
which
followed
his
legal
career
itself
may
be
regarded
as
a
period
of
further
preparation
and
an
exceedingly
important
one
at
the
time
however
the
impressive
facts
were
that
he
threw
himself
into
his
profession
with
characteristic
vigor
and
quickly
achieved
an
honored
position
in
it
from
the
beginning
he
was
probably
more
interested
in
the
study
of
law
than
in
practice
but
if
he
rebelled
against
the
drudgery
incident
to
his
calling
he
did
not
do
so
because
of
any
repugnance
for
details
the
main
reason
for
his
early
abandonment
of
law
was
not
that
he
disliked
it
nor
that
he
preferred
the
political
arena
he
never
hated
anything
connected
with
it
quite
as
much
as
he
loathed
the
controversies
and
recriminations
which
afterwards
befell
him
as
a
public
man
his
practice
of
law
was
a
constituent
part
of
the
business
of
life
until
the
courts
were
closed
shortly
before
the
outbreak
of
the
american
revolution
and
it
was
the
central
part
up
to
the
time
of
his
marriage
he
never
disliked
practical
affairs
in
themselves
he
always
attended
to
them
industriously
and
systematically
and
he
complained
about
them
only
when
they
interfered
unduly
with
more
delightful
things
such
as
the
enrichment
of
the
mind
and
the
enjoyment
of
domestic
life
he
had
little
reason
to
complain
of
undue
interference
before
his
marriage
thus
he
appeared
in
his
first
years
at
the
bar
as
a
man
of
business
apart
from
the
interest
which
inheres
in
most
of
his
activities
small
or
large
and
private
as
well
as
public
this
period
is
of
particular
significance
in
revealing
his
habits
as
a
man
of
affairs
and
the
degree
of
his
practical
effectiveness
before
he
mounted
his
horse
to
ride
to
court
he
had
already
entered
upon
the
business
of
life
to
some
extent
the
year
that
he
attained
his
majority
and
came
into
his
inheritance
he
had
ceased
charging
the
expenses
of
his
education
against
his
father
s
estate
and
had
nominally
assumed
the
headship
of
the
family
also
he
had
had
to
choose
between
the
rivanna
and
the
fluvanna
lands
which
peter
jefferson
had
left
to
him
and
his
young
brother
on
this
subject
there
was
probably
no
question
in
his
mind
at
any
time
he
succeeded
to
the
lands
on
which
his
father
had
lived
and
immediately
assumed
a
position
of
dignity
and
responsibility
in
that
part
of
the
county
the
rivanna
estate
comprised
about
half
and
much
the
more
important
part
of
his
total
inheritance
of
somewhat
more
than
five
thousand
acres
the
family
seat
at
shadwell
with
its
four
hundred
acres
did
not
actually
belong
to
him
until
after
his
mother
s
death
in
the
year
of
the
declaration
of
independence
considerably
before
that
time
he
built
for
himself
a
house
on
the
forested
hill
across
the
way
but
until
he
continued
to
live
at
shad
well
from
the
age
of
twenty
two
also
he
rented
from
his
mother
the
farm
there
with
the
slaves
who
were
on
it
he
had
twenty
slaves
or
more
in
his
own
right
but
these
were
otherwise
employed
the
gristmill
which
his
father
had
built
was
already
his
it
stood
on
the
north
bank
of
the
little
river
and
the
water
which
turned
its
wheels
was
brought
by
a
canal
from
a
dam
half
a
mile
above
it
it
was
a
profitable
piece
of
property
until
it
was
swept
away
with
its
house
and
dam
in
the
great
fresh
of
he
was
not
yet
devoting
himself
much
to
agriculture
though
he
had
assumed
the
necessary
financial
responsibilities
and
had
begun
to
keep
his
garden
book
the
first
entry
in
this
made
in
clear
hand
on
march
has
a
more
poetic
flavor
than
he
probably
realized
when
he
recorded
the
simple
fact
that
the
purple
hyacinth
had
begun
to
bloom
all
the
observations
of
that
year
had
to
do
with
flowers
with
the
narcissus
and
puckoon
in
the
family
garden
with
bluebells
in
the
low
ground
and
wild
honeysuckle
in
the
woods
thus
he
appears
first
as
an
observer
of
the
pleasant
phenomena
of
nature
by
the
time
that
he
became
a
lawyer
however
he
had
become
more
utilitarian
that
year
he
sowed
peas
henceforth
he
continued
to
record
plantings
of
flowers
and
vegetables
shrubs
and
trees
but
he
had
not
started
his
farm
book
as
yet
it
is
impossible
to
believe
that
he
was
ever
indifferent
to
the
crops
of
tobacco
and
corn
on
his
red
fields
but
during
his
years
as
a
bachelor
he
left
his
farms
pretty
much
as
they
were
probably
committing
the
details
of
management
to
a
single
steward
or
overseer
with
one
matter
which
directly
affected
him
as
an
albemarle
planter
however
and
which
was
also
of
considerable
public
interest
he
actively
concerned
himself
from
the
time
that
he
was
grown
his
efforts
to
improve
the
navigation
of
the
stream
which
flowed
through
his
lands
antedated
his
services
in
the
house
of
burgesses
and
even
his
practice
of
law
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge
no
hogsheads
of
tobacco
had
ever
been
transported
on
the
north
branch
of
the
james
to
its
junction
with
the
larger
stream
about
the
time
that
he
came
of
age
however
he
learned
that
a
canoe
had
recently
been
used
on
its
lower
waters
taking
a
canoe
himself
he
explored
the
only
seriously
obstructed
section
and
concluded
that
this
could
be
made
navigable
to
loaded
boats
merely
by
the
removal
of
loose
rock
he
then
set
on
foot
a
subscription
obtained
two
hundred
pounds
and
interested
his
neighbor
dr
thomas
walker
who
was
a
member
of
the
house
of
burgesses
it
was
in
october
that
an
act
of
assembly
was
passed
for
clearing
the
great
falls
of
james
river
the
river
chickahominy
and
the
north
branch
of
james
river
the
legislative
act
merely
authorized
a
laudable
and
useful
undertaking
which
was
to
be
effected
by
private
means
three
groups
of
trustees
were
set
up
to
receive
subscriptions
and
to
make
the
necessary
contracts
in
the
group
assigned
to
the
north
branch
rivanna
was
young
jefferson
along
with
other
prominent
gentlemen
of
the
county
with
almost
every
person
named
on
the
other
lists
he
was
afterwards
associated
in
public
or
private
life
this
appointment
therefore
constituted
the
first
official
sign
of
his
identification
with
the
leaders
of
the
county
and
province
locally
he
was
the
initiator
of
the
project
and
probably
the
most
active
member
of
the
group
the
work
of
clearing
away
the
obstructions
appears
to
have
been
finished
by
the
time
of
his
marriage
and
for
a
generation
afterwards
the
stream
was
used
completely
and
fully
he
said
for
the
carrying
down
of
produce
throughout
the
eighteenth
century
the
navigable
section
began
at
milton
falls
a
mile
or
two
below
shadwell
so
boats
did
not
actually
go
past
his
mill
but
the
short
land
haul
was
not
much
of
an
inconvenience
to
him
years
after
he
initiated
this
undertaking
he
took
great
pride
in
it
shortly
before
he
was
elected
president
he
asked
himself
whether
his
country
was
the
better
for
his
having
lived
at
all
then
rather
dubiously
he
drew
up
a
list
of
things
in
which
he
had
been
the
instrument
beginning
with
this
youthful
effort
to
further
the
flow
of
agricultural
commerce
and
following
with
the
declaration
of
independence
which
was
clearly
second
to
it
in
point
of
time
whether
or
not
this
was
his
most
memorable
action
before
the
revolution
as
he
himself
believed
it
was
his
first
piece
of
constructive
public
service
in
the
year
the
family
at
shadwell
besides
thomas
consisted
of
his
mother
and
four
other
children
jane
randolph
jefferson
was
now
forty
seven
several
times
a
grandmother
and
an
old
lady
by
the
standards
of
the
time
his
younger
sister
elizabeth
unmarried
at
twenty
three
was
undoubtedly
regarded
as
an
old
maid
lucy
now
fifteen
remained
at
home
a
couple
of
years
longer
then
she
married
charles
lilburne
lewis
who
was
also
descended
from
isham
randolph
besides
her
there
were
the
twins
anna
scott
and
randolph
who
were
twelve
peter
jefferson
s
thoughtful
provisions
for
the
maintenance
of
the
younger
children
and
for
the
portions
of
the
girls
had
been
rigorously
carried
out
and
continued
to
be
enough
of
the
financial
records
of
the
family
have
survived
to
show
that
a
good
deal
of
bookkeeping
was
required
and
that
the
elder
son
assumed
much
of
the
burden
of
this
after
he
grew
up
a
decade
before
he
became
important
as
a
drafts
man
of
state
papers
he
showed
that
he
was
particularly
good
at
keeping
accounts
and
at
any
sort
of
paper
work
in
which
diligence
accuracy
and
neatness
were
required
he
not
only
made
a
record
of
the
agreement
with
his
mother
whereby
he
hired
five
of
her
shadwell
hands
at
six
pounds
each
per
annum
he
also
kept
vouchers
for
the
sides
of
pork
the
quarters
of
beef
and
the
bushels
of
corn
that
he
furnished
her
for
his
unmarried
and
not
wholly
responsible
sister
elizabeth
he
began
to
keep
a
special
account
as
soon
as
she
was
grown
though
his
inability
to
prevent
her
from
mixing
her
charges
with
his
own
at
a
store
in
richmond
caused
it
to
become
sadly
confused
there
are
no
surviving
letters
from
this
period
to
illustrate
the
generosity
and
affection
which
he
so
consistently
manifested
towards
all
of
his
close
relations
but
his
scrupulous
exactitude
in
keeping
the
financial
records
of
the
family
was
manifested
from
the
first
life
in
the
plantation
village
of
shadwell
was
doubtless
hospitable
generous
and
friendly
as
it
so
generally
was
in
that
clime
and
region
and
as
it
always
was
afterwards
at
monticello
and
jefferson
himself
was
far
from
parsimonious
but
he
did
like
to
put
everything
down
in
black
and
white
the
major
personal
records
as
distinguished
from
letters
which
remain
and
which
serve
to
illuminate
so
many
of
the
details
of
his
own
life
had
their
beginning
in
this
period
they
are
wholly
objective
in
form
but
they
are
fascinating
documents
of
their
kind
and
are
of
great
importance
to
anyone
who
would
understand
him
the
garden
book
which
he
started
in
and
kept
more
or
less
continuously
for
upwards
of
half
a
century
contains
a
much
greater
variety
of
items
than
its
title
would
imply
and
reveals
from
the
outset
the
utilitarian
cast
of
his
ingenious
mind
in
it
he
noted
that
it
would
take
peas
of
the
sort
he
was
planting
to
fill
a
pint
measure
that
a
horse
would
generally
eat
or
bundles
of
fodder
in
a
night
and
during
an
albemarle
winter
that
hills
would
yield
cucumbers
in
a
season
some
random
bits
of
horticultural
lore
he
copied
out
of
books
but
he
gained
more
from
his
own
observations
or
from
friends
or
neighbors
who
told
him
something
of
interest
which
he
promptly
put
down
to
these
he
added
after
he
became
a
builder
all
sorts
of
miscellaneous
calculations
about
bricks
mortar
wheelbarrows
and
the
like
this
is
no
diary
of
aesthetic
rapture
it
is
a
systematic
though
fragmentary
factual
record
which
served
a
useful
purpose
to
a
practical
man
the
account
books
as
they
are
commonly
called
which
he
kept
in
unending
series
until
the
week
before
he
died
are
distinctly
informal
during
his
years
as
a
practitioner
he
listed
law
cases
here
as
in
a
day
book
and
when
he
had
finished
with
them
or
transferred
them
to
a
more
permanent
record
he
scratched
them
off
he
recorded
here
the
most
trivial
items
of
cash
expenditure
the
first
entries
made
in
the
summer
of
show
him
attending
court
across
the
mountains
in
staunton
he
paid
a
shilling
to
a
washing
woman
and
gave
a
blacksmith
five
shillings
for
shoeing
his
horse
thenceforth
wherever
he
went
he
carried
the
memorandum
book
for
that
year
with
him
jotting
down
at
night
all
the
expenditures
that
he
remembered
and
adding
other
items
of
interesting
information
which
he
had
recently
acquired
considering
the
circumstances
the
entries
are
remarkably
clear
and
understandable
they
rarely
record
impressions
but
they
have
made
it
possible
to
chart
his
daily
movements
to
a
degree
which
is
rarely
possible
in
the
lives
of
even
the
most
notable
of
men
in
another
book
he
began
to
keep
a
formal
record
of
his
important
cases
and
he
also
had
a
fee
book
which
served
as
a
ledger
and
contained
various
accounts
these
records
made
with
more
careful
hand
than
the
daily
memoranda
were
would
delight
the
most
critical
of
eyes
he
listed
his
cases
by
dates
and
number
separating
them
by
neatly
drawn
lines
and
leaving
space
for
filling
in
the
story
of
later
developments
after
the
lapse
of
more
than
a
century
and
a
half
the
writing
is
clear
as
crystal
had
he
been
so
disposed
he
could
have
easily
prepared
a
copybook
for
his
sisters
children
from
this
beautifully
kept
record
we
learn
that
on
february
he
got
a
client
in
the
person
of
gabriel
jones
of
augusta
county
and
entered
caveat
in
his
behalf
for
one
hundred
acres
of
land
near
warm
spring
about
six
weeks
later
he
received
three
pounds
from
jones
though
the
case
continued
into
another
year
he
was
long
to
know
this
eccentric
lawyer
of
the
shenandoah
valley
at
first
as
a
friend
and
later
as
a
political
foe
and
he
had
much
early
business
from
this
county
just
beyond
the
blue
ridge
that
was
where
the
west
began
later
he
said
with
only
slight
inaccuracy
that
staunton
was
the
farthest
he
ever
went
in
that
direction
this
outlying
county
seat
was
then
small
and
crude
that
summer
he
took
a
case
there
for
john
madison
father
of
his
young
friend
james
of
maury
s
school
and
for
long
years
the
county
clerk
the
tradition
is
that
john
madison
did
him
the
honors
of
the
place
at
the
beginning
of
his
legal
career
taking
him
at
length
to
a
loft
where
a
party
were
playing
cards
by
torchlight
madison
who
had
a
powder
horn
beneath
his
coat
dropped
powder
behind
each
man
and
trailed
it
out
the
door
then
just
as
an
unlucky
player
was
invoking
the
devil
he
fired
the
train
and
caused
the
gamesters
to
rush
headlong
from
the
accursed
place
this
is
probably
the
first
story
that
jefferson
ever
told
about
riding
the
circuit
it
is
a
pity
that
he
did
not
tell
more
but
he
was
no
abraham
lincoln
his
business
in
the
county
courts
was
extensive
he
had
cases
in
forty
or
more
of
them
before
he
got
through
unlike
patrick
henry
however
he
did
not
lay
the
foundations
of
his
legal
reputation
in
this
country
practice
no
stories
survive
about
his
participation
in
dramatic
trials
such
as
the
parsons
cause
and
he
gained
no
particular
reputation
as
a
jury
lawyer
in
that
field
patrick
henry
was
the
greatest
of
his
generation
in
virginia
and
after
his
death
many
doubted
if
he
would
ever
be
excelled
even
in
henry
s
case
much
of
the
country
practice
was
routine
business
such
as
bringing
actions
of
debt
and
his
systematic
young
friend
from
albemarle
was
unquestionably
his
superior
as
a
drafts
man
of
legal
papers
and
was
more
diligent
in
matters
of
detail
the
county
courts
were
informal
and
the
more
important
trials
did
not
occur
in
them
family
tribunals
they
have
been
called
at
a
later
time
jefferson
spoke
of
the
procedure
in
albemarle
as
slovenly
and
his
careful
study
of
english
cases
could
have
availed
him
little
there
the
few
surviving
comments
from
his
contemporaries
about
his
abilities
as
a
speaker
give
the
impression
that
during
his
young
manhood
these
were
greater
than
has
been
commonly
supposed
edmund
randolph
said
that
he
spoke
with
ease
perspicuity
and
elegance
though
his
style
was
less
impassioned
than
in
his
writing
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
bellow
if
he
raised
his
voice
it
soon
grew
husky
no
gathering
that
he
attended
in
those
years
was
ever
very
large
but
even
in
a
small
informal
courtroom
he
could
not
hope
to
match
patrick
henry
by
appealing
to
the
emotions
of
jurymen
the
county
court
was
a
notable
institution
in
virginia
both
in
its
judicial
and
executive
aspects
its
magistrates
were
not
jurists
as
in
his
father
s
and
grandfather
s
day
they
were
the
leading
citizens
of
the
various
districts
personal
acquaintance
with
such
men
was
of
great
importance
to
anyone
who
would
play
an
important
part
in
provincial
affairs
and
making
a
round
of
the
counties
constituted
a
political
education
in
itself
jefferson
went
regularly
to
those
that
were
near
his
own
and
he
came
to
know
somebody
in
practically
every
one
of
them
he
said
it
is
doubtful
if
ever
during
his
entire
career
he
had
such
a
wide
personal
acquaintance
in
virginia
as
he
did
before
the
revolution
when
he
was
actively
engaged
in
the
practice
of
law
it
was
on
court
days
that
the
farmers
flocked
to
the
various
seats
that
slaves
and
lands
were
sold
that
auctions
of
all
sorts
were
held
on
such
occasions
the
studious
young
lawyer
rubbed
elbows
with
ordinary
citizens
to
a
greater
extent
than
he
ever
did
afterwards
he
gained
for
himself
no
such
personal
following
as
patrick
henry
did
but
he
made
innumerable
acquaintances
and
gained
an
insight
into
the
thoughts
of
common
men
which
could
not
be
got
from
books
both
by
training
and
temperament
he
was
better
fitted
for
practice
before
the
general
court
to
which
george
wythe
introduced
him
early
in
this
first
year
not
even
this
tribunal
was
composed
of
judges
who
were
learned
in
the
law
it
was
made
up
of
the
members
of
the
council
chosen
for
wealth
and
standing
without
regard
to
legal
knowledge
as
he
himself
said
their
decisions
could
never
be
quoted
either
as
adding
to
or
detracting
from
the
weight
of
those
of
the
english
courts
on
the
same
points
during
his
last
years
as
a
law
student
and
his
early
years
as
a
practitioner
accordingly
he
had
made
careful
study
of
cases
in
the
courts
of
king
s
bench
and
common
pleas
the
domestic
judgments
of
the
general
court
were
authoritative
whether
formed
on
sound
legal
principles
or
not
such
cases
of
domestic
character
as
had
been
reported
therefore
he
studied
and
abstracted
with
care
these
he
found
in
certain
manuscript
volumes
that
were
in
the
possession
of
his
violin
playing
friend
john
randolph
the
attorney
general
the
record
covered
only
the
decade
from
to
and
there
were
no
more
reports
thereafter
until
when
he
himself
began
to
commit
to
writing
some
of
the
leading
cases
of
the
day
in
the
midst
of
his
own
practice
he
served
as
a
self
appointed
reporter
and
as
such
was
a
pioneer
whatever
may
be
said
about
the
prominent
gentlemen
who
served
as
lay
judges
the
virginia
bar
at
this
time
contained
men
of
high
professional
competence
wythe
was
probably
the
most
learned
member
almost
too
learned
some
people
thought
he
had
dwelt
so
long
with
the
ancient
writers
that
it
was
hard
for
him
to
keep
from
giving
a
line
from
horace
the
force
of
an
act
of
assembly
edmund
pendleton
had
had
less
time
for
literature
but
he
was
probably
more
effective
as
a
lawyer
though
a
most
amiable
man
in
personal
relationships
he
was
not
above
baiting
jefferson
s
guileless
teacher
upsetting
his
equanimity
and
thus
robbing
him
of
his
strength
the
star
of
thomson
mason
who
was
comparable
with
george
wythe
in
legal
erudition
had
risen
and
john
randolph
who
had
succeeded
his
brother
as
king
s
attorney
was
an
uncommonly
able
man
he
suffered
by
comparison
with
the
relative
newcomer
patrick
henry
however
when
they
locked
horns
in
criminal
cases
which
were
the
latter
s
special
forte
during
this
period
the
orator
is
reported
to
have
worn
a
black
suit
and
tie
wig
when
he
appeared
in
the
general
court
to
the
considerable
improvement
of
his
appearance
jefferson
acted
with
him
on
certain
occasions
proving
himself
to
be
no
master
of
overwhelming
eloquence
but
an
impressive
speaker
as
long
as
his
voice
held
out
when
they
appeared
together
each
of
the
men
characterized
himself
so
edmund
randolph
said
mr
jefferson
drew
copiously
from
the
depths
of
the
law
mr
henry
from
the
recesses
of
the
human
heart
two
of
the
arguments
which
jefferson
used
in
actual
cases
have
been
preserved
in
the
reports
which
he
made
and
which
were
published
after
his
death
he
may
have
selected
these
chiefly
because
of
the
questions
they
dealt
with
for
one
had
to
do
with
slavery
and
the
other
with
the
clergy
about
two
years
after
he
began
to
practise
he
took
without
fee
the
case
of
one
samuel
howell
the
latter
s
grandmother
was
a
mulatto
begotten
of
a
white
woman
by
a
negro
man
and
bound
by
the
law
to
serve
until
the
age
of
thirty
one
during
her
servitude
she
was
delivered
of
howell
s
mother
and
the
latter
during
her
own
servitude
was
delivered
of
howell
this
third
mulatto
was
suing
for
freedom
from
the
master
to
whom
he
had
been
sold
and
who
claimed
his
services
until
he
was
thirty
one
jefferson
s
scholarly
argument
was
doomed
from
the
outset
and
the
court
did
not
even
wait
to
hear
that
of
the
equally
humane
wythe
on
the
other
side
jefferson
s
contention
was
that
one
act
had
made
a
servant
of
the
first
mulatto
and
that
a
later
one
had
extended
it
to
her
children
but
that
it
remained
for
some
future
legislature
if
any
should
be
found
wicked
enough
to
extend
it
to
grandchildren
and
other
issue
more
remote
the
language
of
his
peroration
must
have
been
startling
especially
when
coupled
with
an
earlier
reference
of
his
to
the
law
of
nature
under
that
law
he
said
we
are
all
born
free
that
he
had
come
to
such
a
philosophical
position
by
the
time
this
case
was
adjudged
in
is
a
significant
item
in
the
history
of
his
thought
but
such
an
assertion
carried
no
weight
with
a
practical
minded
court
in
a
slave
owning
society
in
the
other
reported
case
he
represented
the
church
wardens
and
vestry
men
of
a
parish
in
nansemond
county
in
an
action
whereby
they
sought
to
oust
an
unworthy
clergyman
named
patrick
lunan
the
latter
was
accused
of
profane
swearing
drunkenness
and
adultery
he
was
said
to
have
declared
that
he
cared
not
what
religion
he
professed
so
long
as
he
got
his
pay
in
tobacco
and
also
to
have
exposed
his
private
parts
to
public
view
the
main
question
was
whether
or
not
the
right
of
visitation
and
deprivation
resided
in
the
court
and
by
means
of
an
elaborate
historical
treatise
jefferson
undertook
to
prove
that
it
did
reside
in
the
court
as
representing
the
king
his
contention
was
upheld
in
october
and
he
got
a
five
pound
fee
but
the
case
was
still
awaiting
adjudication
three
years
later
when
he
retired
from
practice
he
had
upheld
the
power
of
the
provincial
court
over
the
clergy
but
at
a
later
time
he
would
not
have
conceded
so
much
to
the
prerogative
of
the
king
judging
from
the
number
of
his
cases
jefferson
had
a
substantial
legal
business
in
the
seven
years
of
his
practice
he
listed
nearly
a
thousand
in
his
formal
record
the
fact
that
robert
carter
nicholas
wanted
to
turn
over
his
business
to
him
in
is
indicative
of
his
standing
while
the
further
fact
that
he
declined
to
take
it
except
for
a
very
few
cases
which
he
finished
shows
that
he
already
had
just
about
as
much
as
he
could
do
his
clients
at
one
time
or
another
included
members
of
most
of
the
leading
families
of
the
province
randolphs
and
pages
carys
and
harrisons
nelsons
and
lees
carters
and
byrds
in
the
second
year
of
his
practice
he
recorded
in
his
case
book
apparently
with
pride
the
honble
wm
byrd
retains
me
generally
his
cases
dealt
with
land
ownership
debts
the
recovery
of
slaves
slander
assault
and
barker
he
rendered
opinions
for
which
he
generally
charged
twenty
shillings
he
drew
some
deeds
and
advised
about
wills
he
instituted
suits
in
chancery
even
though
his
jury
trials
may
not
have
been
colorful
there
is
human
interest
in
many
of
his
dry
entries
and
they
show
clearly
that
the
serious
young
lawyer
whose
arguments
tended
to
be
so
elaborate
had
abundant
opportunity
to
observe
the
seamy
side
of
life
in
the
first
year
of
his
practice
for
example
there
were
such
as
these

burkin
etc
dismissed
at
plaintiff
s
request
whether
or
not
this
business
was
profitable
depends
on
the
criteria
that
are
applied
the
statement
of
jefferson
s
executor
that
his
average
profits
as
expressed
in
dollars
were
about
a
year
has
often
been
quoted
for
those
days
that
sum
would
have
represented
a
handsome
addition
to
the
living
and
income
that
he
got
from
his
landed
estate
in
this
generous
estimate
however
the
word
profits
is
loosely
used
to
designate
the
sums
that
were
due
him
never
did
the
fees
that
he
charged
aggregate
much
more
than
a
year
and
they
generally
amounted
to
less
furthermore
he
never
succeeded
in
collecting
as
much
as
per
cent
his
legal
business
reached
its
greatest
volume
in
and
in
that
year
he
managed
to
collect
of
the
amount
that
was
due
him
it
is
doubtful
if
he
had
any
more
trouble
with
collections
than
other
lawyers
did
difficulties
of
this
sort
were
general
and
notorious
the
year
that
he
was
admitted
to
the
bar
another
lawyer
announced
that
the
backwardness
of
his
clients
in
paying
him
would
have
obliged
him
to
quit
his
practice
had
he
been
impelled
by
no
other
reason
john
mercer
had
appointed
a
receiver
but
the
latter
out
of
had
not
yet
been
able
to
collect
enough
to
cover
his
own
wage
and
mercer
s
taxes
accordingly
the
unfortunate
lawyer
now
felt
compelled
to
sue
the
situation
was
so
serious
that
in
may
jefferson
pendleton
john
randolph
patrick
henry
and
two
other
lawyers
inserted
a
notice
in
the
gazette
they
announced
that
it
would
not
be
possible
for
them
to
continue
their
practice
in
the
general
court
on
the
same
terms
as
heretofore
even
if
the
fees
allowed
by
law
were
regularly
paid
they
said
these
would
barely
compensate
them
for
their
incessant
labors
or
reimburse
their
expenses
and
the
losses
incurred
by
the
neglect
of
their
private
affairs
yet
even
these
confessedly
moderate
rewards
were
withheld
in
large
proportion
by
the
unworthy
part
of
their
clients
accordingly
they
announced
that
after
a
specified
date
in
the
fall
they
would
require
full
payment
before
rendering
an
opinion
and
would
not
prosecute
or
defend
a
case
unless
they
received
the
tax
in
advance
and
half
the
fee
by
that
time
jefferson
had
already
found
it
necessary
to
give
more
of
his
time
to
his
personal
affairs
and
in
the
year
following
this
announcement
he
wholly
retired
from
practice
in
his
years
as
a
bachelor
that
is
until
he
was
nearing
twenty
nine
and
had
been
almost
five
years
at
the
bar
absence
from
home
disturbed
him
much
less
than
it
did
after
he
had
a
family
of
his
own
and
unquestionably
his
journeys
imparted
increased
interest
to
his
life
on
his
way
to
the
county
courts
and
to
williamsburg
he
generally
went
on
horseback
or
in
a
one
horse
chair
his
servant
jupiter
who
was
just
his
age
as
a
rule
went
with
him
or
followed
close
behind
possibly
carrying
his
luggage
in
a
cart
the
name
of
this
trusted
companion
of
the
road
who
had
been
going
with
him
since
his
days
as
a
law
student
recurs
in
his
account
books
with
regularity
jefferson
was
always
giving
money
to
jupiter
to
pay
a
saddler
in
staunton
to
pay
for
ferriages
to
williamsburg
and
for
bread
and
candles
there
he
even
borrowed
small
coin
from
jupiter
at
times
when
he
himself
ran
out
he
and
his
slave
did
not
keep
house
both
in
the
county
seats
and
in
the
provincial
capital
he
stayed
generally
in
such
lodgings
as
the
times
afforded
though
en
route
he
frequently
stopped
with
relatives
or
friends
such
as
the
carrs
and
thomas
mann
randolph
whom
the
slaves
called
tuckahoe
tom
his
visits
to
williamsburg
coincided
with
the
court
sessions
and
thus
fell
in
the
most
crowded
times
when
the
regular
residents
had
too
many
guests
in
the
second
year
of
his
practice
if
we
may
judge
by
the
size
of
his
various
bills
he
lodged
at
charlton
s
on
the
broad
duke
of
gloucester
street
and
took
many
meals
at
the
raleigh
tavern
across
the
way
going
to
the
coffee
house
beyond
the
capitol
frequently
for
food
and
liquid
entertainment
and
occasionally
to
ayscough
s
and
mrs
vobe
s
if
the
gaming
in
these
places
was
as
constant
as
has
been
reported
the
clatter
of
the
dice
boxes
must
have
been
trying
to
one
who
prized
tranquillity
so
much
he
made
many
visits
to
john
page
at
rosewell
riding
or
driving
to
york
then
ferrying
to
gloucester
at
the
home
of
this
friend
he
fiddled
and
talked
in
company
which
was
often
if
not
always
mixed
it
was
a
pleasant
life
and
as
a
young
gentleman
who
bought
for
himself
not
only
books
and
fiddle
strings
but
also
broadcloth
silk
hose
and
buckskin
gloves
he
played
his
conventional
part
in
it
he
continued
to
indulge
in
idle
social
chatter
when
he
wrote
to
page
but
it
was
not
in
his
nature
to
be
silly
for
very
long
the
playhouse
in
williamsburg
had
several
good
seasons
during
his
early
years
as
a
lawyer
the
virginia
company
of
comedians
which
came
there
in
may
not
have
been
the
equal
of
the
london
company
of
the
elder
lewis
hallam
which
had
visited
the
capital
in
his
boyhood
or
of
the
american
company
of
david
douglas
which
had
appeared
there
when
he
was
in
college
but
it
put
on
a
considerable
number
of
plays
that
spring
and
when
he
was
there
he
rarely
missed
one
among
these
were
addison
s
the
drummer
the
merchant
of
venice
otway
s
venice
preserved
and
the
orphan
and
the
beggar
s
opera
with
peter
pelham
conducting
the
orchestra
farces
were
often
added
to
the
main
attraction
and
the
spirit
of
the
company
was
as
comic
as
its
name
implied
there
were
no
other
regular
theatrical
performances
until
the
spring
of
and
before
the
gaieties
of
that
season
were
in
swing
a
disturbing
event
had
occurred
on
the
banks
of
the
rivanna
and
had
been
reported
in
williamsburg
on
february
this
item
appeared
in
the
virginia
gazette
we
hear
from
albemarle
that
about
a
fortnight
ago
the
house
of
thomas
jefferson
esq
in
that
county
was
burnt
to
the
ground
together
with
all
his
furniture
books
papers
c
by
which
that
gentleman
sustains
a
very
great
loss
he
was
from
home
when
the
accident
occurred
to
be
exact
the
conflagration
occurred
on
february
jefferson
had
dined
with
the
family
probably
about
two
o
clock
and
had
then
gone
to
charlottesville
on
business
he
had
his
first
news
from
a
servant
who
was
dispatched
after
him
and
who
undoubtedly
reported
that
no
lives
were
lost
the
tradition
is
that
he
immediately
asked
if
they
had
saved
his
books
and
that
the
slave
replied
no
master
all
lost
but
we
save
your
fiddle
presumably
this
was
the
instrument
he
had
bought
for
five
pounds
in
williamsburg
the
year
before
actually
a
few
books
were
saved
along
with
two
or
three
beds
but
little
else
for
two
or
three
years
he
had
been
planning
to
leave
shadwell
as
soon
as
his
building
operations
on
the
mountain
would
permit
and
work
was
sufficiently
advanced
at
monticello
for
him
to
move
there
late
in
the
following
november
to
endure
the
rigors
of
winter
in
a
single
room
the
other
members
of
the
family
continued
to
live
at
shadwell
until
after
his
mother
s
death
probably
making
the
best
they
could
of
the
remaining
buildings
jefferson
estimated
at
two
hundred
pounds
sterling
the
value
of
his
books
that
were
burned
but
it
was
not
the
monetary
loss
that
evoked
his
groans
these
were
mainly
law
books
which
he
could
not
immediately
replace
and
with
them
were
destroyed
the
notes
which
he
had
carefully
prepared
for
his
cases
in
the
approaching
general
court
these
are
gone
he
wrote
page
and
like
the
baseless
fabric
of
a
vision
leave
not
a
trace
behind
unlike
john
marshall
he
did
not
learn
through
the
ear
but
through
the
eye
he
was
not
one
who
could
speak
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
he
put
all
important
things
down
on
paper
and
without
notes
he
was
lost
he
wondered
therefore
if
it
would
not
be
possible
for
him
to
get
a
postponement
of
his
cases
believing
that
an
exception
might
justly
be
made
in
such
singular
circumstances
he
managed
to
maintain
a
light
tone
of
youthful
banter
in
writing
to
this
good
friend
but
he
could
not
conceal
his
deep
concern
his
friends
hastened
to
console
and
help
him
though
page
at
the
time
had
troubles
of
his
own
his
wife
had
just
lost
her
mother
so
he
penned
only
a
few
hasty
lines
at
york
which
the
younger
thomas
nelson
enclosed
the
latter
promised
to
speed
jefferson
s
order
to
the
booksellers
and
assured
him
that
his
cases
would
be
postponed
the
elder
thomas
nelson
offered
to
make
him
a
loan
from
his
own
collection
and
in
the
meantime
sent
hinges
locks
and
pulleys
doubtless
thinking
that
these
would
be
needed
at
monticello
sooner
than
had
been
expected
by
sending
him
nectarines
apricot
grafts
and
grapevines
for
the
orchard
he
was
planting
on
the
hillside
there
george
wythe
showed
that
he
maintained
his
classic
calm
like
page
he
congratulated
his
young
friend
on
his
philosophic
spirit
predicting
that
he
would
not
only
surmount
his
difficulties
but
be
the
richer
for
his
unfortunate
experience
soon
thereafter
page
now
more
at
leisure
wrote
him
in
sentimental
vein
it
is
probable
that
he
did
get
a
continuance
of
his
cases
or
most
of
them
at
all
events
he
managed
to
get
through
the
busiest
of
his
legal
years
he
restored
his
books
at
the
earliest
possible
time
borrowing
for
this
purpose
one
hundred
pounds
which
dabney
carr
had
lying
idle
though
this
sum
alone
was
not
enough
within
three
years
he
had
more
volumes
than
he
had
lost
his
personal
papers
however
were
not
replaceable
and
it
is
largely
for
this
reason
that
the
story
of
his
life
up
to
can
never
be
told
with
such
fullness
as
can
that
of
his
later
years
he
himself
said
the
letters
of
a
person
especially
of
one
whose
business
has
been
chiefly
transacted
by
letters
form
the
only
full
and
genuine
journal
of
his
life
during
his
young
manhood
when
he
was
fresh
in
the
world
of
affairs
he
probably
did
not
make
copies
of
his
letters
so
carefully
as
he
did
afterward
but
we
would
know
considerably
more
about
him
before
he
reached
the
age
of
twenty
seven
if
the
house
at
shadwell
had
not
burned
fortunately
the
loss
was
not
so
complete
as
he
implied
he
said
that
he
was
destitute
of
papers
of
every
kind
whether
public
or
private
of
business
or
amusement
but
he
had
preserved
his
memorandum
account
books
and
was
thus
enabled
to
draw
up
new
records
his
garden
book
almost
certainly
was
at
monticello
probably
he
had
continued
his
boyish
habit
of
reading
on
his
hilltop
and
for
that
reason
also
kept
his
commonplace
books
there
he
has
left
a
fairly
full
though
largely
an
external
story
of
his
young
manhood
but
it
was
not
until
after
the
fire
that
he
became
par
excellence
a
keeper
of
records
and
began
to
accumulate
documentary
treasures
such
as
have
rarely
been
amassed
by
any
man
this
was
a
part
of
the
business
of
life
which
he
took
seriously
and
attended
to
with
care
x
among
the
burgesses
the
coming
of
a
new
royal
governor
to
virginia
about
six
months
after
fauquier
died
was
an
event
of
great
interest
in
the
province
and
it
had
important
effects
on
the
career
of
jefferson
who
was
twenty
five
years
old
at
the
time
he
was
in
williamsburg
in
late
october
when
the
right
honorable
norborne
berkeley
baron
de
botetourt
arrived
he
was
not
among
those
who
extended
an
official
welcome
to
his
lordship
about
sunset
or
who
had
supper
with
him
afterwards
at
the
raleigh
tavern
but
he
could
hardly
have
failed
to
view
the
festive
illumination
of
the
city
that
night
then
it
was
that
people
of
all
ranks
vied
with
each
other
in
testifying
their
gratitude
and
joy
that
a
nobleman
of
such
distinguished
merit
and
abilities
had
come
to
dwell
among
them
though
jefferson
preferred
fauquier
who
was
not
a
lord
and
was
technically
only
a
deputy
governor
he
was
not
yet
suspicious
of
noblemen
as
such
and
like
most
other
people
he
probably
thought
it
a
compliment
that
the
british
authorities
had
sent
to
the
colony
a
resident
governor
general
there
were
some
people
in
virginia
and
more
in
england
who
questioned
the
wisdom
of
appointing
this
lord
of
the
bedchamber
who
had
suffered
serious
if
not
discreditable
financial
reverses
but
the
description
of
botetourt
by
junius
as
a
cringing
bowing
fawning
sword
bearing
courtier
was
extreme
now
about
fifty
he
had
been
a
diligent
tory
member
of
the
house
of
commons
and
had
come
into
his
title
four
years
before
he
sailed
to
america
nobody
could
question
his
loyalty
to
his
king
and
everybody
agreed
that
he
was
a
good
companion
he
wore
a
smile
upon
his
face
and
the
virginians
were
disposed
to
take
him
at
his
face
value
in
the
end
they
loved
him
more
than
they
had
fauquier
or
any
other
of
their
viceroys
jefferson
regarded
him
as
both
an
honorable
and
an
amiable
man
but
he
never
became
intimate
with
him
botetourt
provided
the
occasion
for
jefferson
s
early
entrance
into
political
life
on
the
day
after
his
arrival
the
new
governor
properly
dissolved
the
old
assembly
which
was
not
then
in
session
and
soon
after
that
he
issued
writs
for
the
election
of
a
new
one
as
a
result
of
this
action
the
freeholders
of
albemarle
met
in
the
courthouse
in
charlottesville
before
the
middle
of
december
and
elected
thomas
jefferson
as
one
of
their
two
burgesses
and
in
the
month
of
may
he
took
his
seat
for
the
first
time
as
a
member
of
a
legislative
body
during
the
next
fifteen
years
he
performed
his
public
service
primarily
as
a
legislator
the
electors
who
chose
him
on
this
occasion
were
men
possessing
at
least
fifty
unsettled
acres
or
twenty
five
if
they
had
a
plantation
and
small
house
for
the
times
the
suffrage
was
liberal
since
that
much
land
could
be
rather
easily
acquired
the
freeholders
voted
openly
however
and
the
opinions
and
preferences
of
the
recognized
leaders
were
generally
determinative
jefferson
s
friend
dr
thomas
walker
who
had
just
returned
from
an
important
indian
conference
at
fort
stanwix
was
re
elected
the
other
burgess
in
the
previous
assembly
had
been
edward
carter
whose
holdings
in
the
county
considerably
exceeded
jefferson
s
and
included
carter
s
mountain
towering
over
monticello
carter
had
failed
to
attend
during
the
last
session
however
and
this
fact
probably
was
to
his
disadvantage
it
is
impossible
to
determine
now
just
how
sharp
the
contest
was
but
presumably
there
were
no
public
issues
the
campaigning
of
that
era
which
they
called
burgessing
was
wholly
personal
and
consisted
primarily
of
providing
drinks
and
other
refreshments
at
or
before
elections
swilling
the
planters
with
bumbo
as
one
observer
put
it
jefferson
and
carter
may
have
provided
rum
jointly
and
the
former
recorded
other
expenditures
for
drinks
and
cakes
all
this
was
modest
however
and
it
had
the
flavor
of
gentlemanly
hospitality
by
nature
jefferson
was
not
good
at
electioneering
or
at
mingling
with
a
crowd
his
manners
kelly
never
be
harsh
one
of
his
friends
observed
but
they
were
reserved
towards
the
world
at
large
it
was
fortunate
for
this
future
hero
of
the
plain
people
that
his
career
began
in
a
period
when
influential
gentlemen
were
at
the
helm
the
meeting
at
the
courthouse
was
for
him
a
sort
of
prelude
to
politics
but
it
can
be
more
aptly
described
as
a
genial
introduction
to
public
life
at
that
time
and
place
a
man
of
his
estate
and
training
was
expected
to
share
the
burden
of
public
affairs
and
his
ultimate
election
to
the
assembly
might
have
been
confidently
expected
without
any
special
effort
on
his
part
normally
he
would
have
served
first
as
a
local
magistrate
and
possibly
he
did
a
couple
of
years
later
he
was
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
member
of
the
county
court
as
his
father
had
been
and
he
may
have
begun
this
service
before
he
attained
the
more
responsible
post
of
burgess
at
all
events
he
quickly
telescoped
his
father
s
public
career
early
initiation
into
public
affairs
was
not
uncommon
in
the
province
but
his
election
at
the
age
of
twenty
five
to
a
position
which
his
father
had
attained
only
in
the
ripeness
of
years
was
a
tribute
to
him
nevertheless
the
leaders
among
the
local
gentry
had
undoubtedly
perceived
that
peter
jefferson
s
son
was
a
young
man
of
unusual
talent
and
diligence
and
they
must
have
been
impressed
with
the
enterprise
and
public
spirit
which
he
had
shown
in
his
vigorous
efforts
to
improve
the
navigation
of
the
rivanna
in
later
years
his
fellow
citizens
of
albemarle
congratulated
themselves
on
their
foresight
in
giving
him
this
early
appointment
and
with
it
the
opportunity
to
become
more
widely
known
the
freeholders
of
his
county
elected
him
as
soon
as
they
very
well
could
they
retained
him
as
their
representative
until
he
proceeded
to
larger
tasks
and
they
never
let
him
be
a
prophet
without
honor
at
home
both
they
and
he
had
reason
to
be
proud
of
this
unfailing
loyalty
he
afterwards
claimed
that
he
always
disliked
public
life
but
there
is
no
more
evidence
that
he
avoided
it
at
the
outset
than
there
is
that
he
made
vigorous
efforts
to
enter
it
participation
in
matters
of
local
government
was
as
much
a
part
of
the
normal
business
of
life
as
practising
law
or
cultivating
his
farms
service
in
the
house
of
burgesses
was
not
continuous
but
periodical
and
he
was
still
a
bachelor
who
could
easily
take
the
road
he
was
not
personally
aggressive
and
did
not
crave
power
but
he
always
set
high
value
on
the
esteem
of
his
fellows
and
at
this
stage
he
craved
honor
in
that
sense
but
probably
in
no
other
he
had
more
than
the
little
spice
of
ambition
which
he
acknowledged
he
could
not
have
failed
to
see
that
in
this
region
the
only
real
promise
of
distinction
lay
in
the
field
of
public
affairs
as
has
been
well
said
to
live
and
act
like
gentlemen
was
a
thing
once
so
common
in
virginia
that
nobody
thought
of
noticing
it
lawyers
achieved
little
prominence
merely
as
lawyers
patrick
henry
first
attracted
attention
in
a
public
case
and
all
of
the
able
practitioners
in
the
general
court
whom
history
remembers
were
statesmen
as
well
science
and
philosophy
were
not
professions
here
they
were
merely
the
avocations
of
gentlemen
who
must
obtain
support
and
gain
prominence
by
other
means
years
after
jefferson
entered
the
house
of
burgesses
an
eminent
jurist
sagely
remarked
the
truth
is
that
socrates
himself
would
pass
unnoticed
and
forgotten
in
virginia
if
he
were
not
a
public
character
jefferson
was
not
yet
a
public
character
but
he
had
taken
a
necessary
step
if
he
would
ever
become
one
he
did
not
wait
until
the
eve
of
the
assembly
to
go
to
williamsburg
with
his
trusty
jupiter
he
was
there
during
most
of
the
month
of
april
attending
to
legal
business
and
diverting
himself
at
odd
times
early
in
may
along
with
the
other
burgesses
he
took
the
oath
in
the
council
chamber
at
the
capitol
since
this
was
his
first
session
the
procedure
probably
impressed
him
more
than
it
ever
did
afterwards
the
formalities
required
a
good
deal
of
walking
to
and
fro
but
fortunately
the
distances
were
short
after
being
sworn
the
burgesses
returned
to
their
own
chamber
whence
they
were
summoned
again
to
the
council
room
to
attend
the
governor
he
then
instructed
them
to
go
back
and
choose
a
speaker
they
unanimously
elected
peyton
randolph
the
mace
was
laid
on
the
table
and
lord
botetourt
was
informed
this
was
by
no
means
the
end
of
it
however
for
they
then
attended
his
excellency
again
and
learned
without
surprise
that
he
had
approved
their
choice
his
lordship
was
wearing
a
light
red
coat
the
speaker
now
formally
recognized
laid
claim
to
the
ancient
rights
and
privileges
of
the
house
particularly
freedom
of
speech
and
debate
exemption
from
arrest
and
the
protection
of
their
estates
these
the
governor
solemnly
promised
to
defend
then
slowly
and
with
long
pauses
he
made
them
a
little
speech
the
members
finally
returned
to
their
own
places
and
resolved
that
an
address
be
presented
to
his
excellency
in
response
to
his
very
affectionate
words
these
resolutions
were
drawn
by
the
young
burgess
from
albemarle
all
this
was
traditional
procedure
embroidered
by
deliberate
design
in
this
provincial
setting
the
visible
representative
of
a
distant
monarch
was
putting
on
as
best
he
could
a
royal
show
he
had
ridden
from
the
palace
to
the
capitol
in
a
superbly
furnished
coach
of
state
which
had
been
presented
to
him
by
the
duke
of
cumberland
uncle
of
the
king
and
now
bore
the
virginia
arms
jefferson
and
the
other
burgesses
had
no
doubt
watched
it
as
six
white
horses
drew
it
up
the
broad
duke
of
gloucester
street
if
the
later
foe
of
kings
regarded
this
parade
and
all
these
reflections
of
regal
splendor
as
unbecoming
to
a
representative
body
which
was
jealous
of
its
own
prerogatives
he
gave
no
such
suggestion
in
the
first
of
his
public
papers
the
brief
resolutions
which
he
drew
at
the
request
of
edmund
pendleton
were
in
the
courtly
style
we
need
not
be
surprised
to
find
in
them
such
standardized
expressions
as
a
most
humble
and
dutiful
address
his
majesty
s
sacred
person
and
government
and
a
lively
sense
of
his
royal
favor
more
honeyed
words
than
these
appeared
in
the
petition
which
the
house
of
burgesses
had
sent
to
george
iii
the
year
before
when
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
asserting
its
own
rights
the
iron
hand
was
covered
almost
concealed
by
its
velvet
glove
if
jefferson
s
early
draftsmanship
is
to
be
judged
at
all
from
these
stereotyped
resolutions
it
must
be
from
the
last
of
them
in
this
he
effected
a
felicitous
juncture
of
loyalty
with
firmness
thus
aptly
expressing
the
spirit
of
this
polite
but
self
reliant
group
if
any
questions
affecting
great
britain
should
arise
he
hoped
they
would
be
discussed
on
this
ruling
principle
her
interests
and
ours
are
inseparably
the
same
and
finally
he
prayed
that
providence
and
the
royal
pleasure
may
long
continue
his
lordship
the
happy
ruler
of
a
free
and
happy
people
he
had
to
content
himself
with
this
slight
production
for
the
address
which
he
drew
soon
thereafter
was
thought
by
the
committee
to
follow
the
diction
of
the
resolutions
too
strictly
and
not
to
amplify
the
subjects
sufficiently
the
chief
objector
robert
carter
nicholas
was
then
asked
to
draft
the
paper
and
in
jefferson
s
opinion
he
did
this
with
amplification
enough
some
of
the
phrases
of
the
younger
man
reappeared
in
less
rhythmical
form
in
the
address
which
was
adopted
but
this
was
a
less
distinguished
piece
of
writing
than
his
original
resolutions
whatever
may
be
thought
of
them
time
showed
much
more
convincingly
that
he
was
a
better
writer
than
the
veteran
nicholas
or
any
other
of
the
distinguished
committeemen
but
this
experience
at
the
beginning
of
his
legislative
career
left
an
unpleasant
memory
of
chagrin
time
also
showed
that
sensitiveness
was
characteristic
of
his
nature
and
constituted
his
chief
personal
weakness
as
a
public
man
pendleton
was
undoubtedly
aware
of
his
diligence
and
of
his
skill
in
all
sorts
of
paper
work
and
probably
anticipated
that
he
would
t
prove
a
useful
committeeman
as
in
the
next
few
years
he
did
jefferson
was
appointed
to
two
other
committees
in
his
first
session
but
it
is
unlikely
that
he
was
immediately
introduced
into
the
inner
circle
of
the
legislators
as
has
been
claimed
in
formal
sessions
he
was
a
silent
member
even
after
he
had
become
much
more
mature
he
was
always
at
his
best
in
a
small
group
and
he
did
not
like
to
raise
his
voice
he
never
sat
in
a
larger
legislative
body
than
the
house
of
burgesses
the
members
must
have
crowded
the
small
chamber
and
have
had
little
elbow
room
if
ever
they
were
all
there
each
of
the
fifty
seven
counties
was
entitled
to
two
of
them
and
three
boroughs
and
the
college
of
william
and
mary
each
had
one
nearly
all
of
the
leaders
whom
jefferson
had
seen
in
action
during
his
student
days
were
still
in
evidence
for
the
principle
of
continuity
in
office
prevailed
peyton
randolph
was
even
more
dignified
and
stately
since
he
had
become
a
permanent
presiding
officer
but
jefferson
found
him
affable
and
kind
richard
bland
looked
more
than
ever
like
a
piece
of
parchment
robert
carter
nicholas
was
weighted
with
care
being
the
treasurer
of
the
colony
but
he
was
not
yet
at
the
point
of
offering
his
law
practice
to
the
young
committeeman
whom
he
had
chagrined
patrick
henry
was
dressing
better
but
he
was
never
anything
but
plain
nor
was
he
at
all
remarkable
until
he
began
to
speak
he
generally
remained
inactive
until
a
crisis
arose
bothering
little
with
routine
or
detail
richard
henry
lee
was
a
more
even
speaker
though
he
never
attained
such
heights
and
adroit
pendleton
was
the
best
director
of
parliamentary
affairs
from
charles
city
county
where
jefferson
afterwards
found
a
wife
had
come
big
benjamin
harrison
archibald
cary
whose
daughter
married
thomas
mann
randolph
of
tuckahoe
was
there
from
chesterfield
he
was
one
of
the
smaller
men
jefferson
s
early
client
gabriel
jones
had
crossed
the
mountains
from
augusta
and
his
friend
thomas
nelson
junior
had
come
up
from
york
more
important
than
any
of
these
in
history
and
in
jefferson
s
future
career
however
was
a
splendid
figure
of
a
man
from
fairfax
ordinarily
george
washington
did
not
have
much
to
say
but
he
had
come
to
the
meeting
with
something
in
his
pocket
it
was
probably
at
this
session
that
jefferson
met
him
for
the
first
time
but
a
decade
passed
before
they
knew
each
other
very
well
though
the
new
burgess
from
albemarle
was
one
of
the
taller
among
many
tall
members
he
did
not
yet
tower
in
this
company
and
at
his
age
he
could
hardly
have
been
expected
to
he
learned
far
more
from
their
deliberations
than
he
contributed
to
them
these
able
virginians
constituted
an
experienced
vigorous
and
self
confident
group
banded
together
by
common
interests
and
infused
with
a
common
spirit
they
did
not
need
the
spur
of
patrick
henry
s
passionate
oratory
at
this
meeting
in
closed
sessions
there
was
some
dissent
but
on
questions
which
affected
their
liberties
as
legislators
and
their
rights
as
colonists
they
stood
practically
as
one
jefferson
had
an
opportunity
to
observe
this
united
front
somewhat
sooner
than
lord
botetourt
did
on
may
by
unanimous
vote
the
burgesses
passed
certain
resolves
and
on
the
next
day
the
genial
representative
of
the
king
who
had
sought
to
avoid
just
this
eventuality
found
it
necessary
to
dissolve
them
despite
all
the
lengthy
ceremonial
at
the
beginning
they
remained
in
session
for
only
ten
days
much
turbulent
water
had
gone
over
the
dam
since
jefferson
had
heard
patrick
henry
inveigh
against
the
stamp
act
in
this
same
chamber
and
had
witnessed
in
annapolis
the
rejoicings
at
the
repeal
of
that
obnoxious
measure
his
relative
richard
bland
had
written
a
pamphlet
entitled
an
inquiry
into
the
rights
of
the
british
colonies
which
he
read
and
from
which
he
profited
he
himself
never
bothered
however
to
follow
bland
in
denying
the
virtual
representation
of
the
colonies
in
parliament
which
certain
britishers
had
alleged
as
a
justification
for
taxation
that
question
was
closed
in
his
mind
by
the
time
that
he
began
to
speak
of
the
connected
chain
of
parliamentary
usurpation
of
all
the
acts
of
usurpation
which
had
followed
the
imposition
of
the
stamp
taxes
the
temporary
suspension
of
the
legislature
of
the
colony
of
new
york
left
the
deepest
impress
on
his
mind
the
previous
assembly
had
addressed
itself
to
this
question
and
jefferson
himself
retained
the
conviction
that
never
until
they
had
surrendered
their
common
sense
would
americans
admit
that
they
held
their
political
existence
at
the
will
of
parliament
this
issue
arose
again
and
became
dominant
in
the
end
a
more
burning
issue
in
this
session
was
provided
by
the
townshend
duties
voted
by
parliament
two
years
earlier
and
still
on
the
statute
books
these
had
been
imposed
at
the
instance
of
a
showy
and
cynical
british
minister
who
derided
the
distinction
between
internal
and
external
taxes
since
the
obstreperous
colonists
had
objected
to
the
one
he
would
accomplish
a
similar
purpose
by
giving
them
the
other
by
this
time
jefferson
may
already
have
reached
the
conclusion
he
afterwards
proclaimed
that
the
controversy
over
internal
and
external
taxes
was
a
sham
battle
but
in
direct
opposition
to
townshend
he
believed
that
parliament
had
authority
to
impose
neither
rather
than
a
right
to
impose
both
the
burgesses
were
not
yet
ready
to
say
that
they
were
opposed
to
laws
designed
to
raise
revenue
under
the
guise
of
regulating
external
trade
but
they
were
willing
to
acquiesce
in
measures
for
preserving
a
necessary
dependence
at
this
juncture
they
were
particularly
concerned
about
what
had
happened
in
massachusetts
the
bay
colony
continued
to
be
a
seat
of
trouble
jefferson
himself
said
that
the
struggle
which
led
to
the
american
revolution
began
in
each
colony
whenever
the
encroachment
was
presented
to
it
and
that
there
was
opposition
in
massachusetts
earlier
than
in
virginia
also
for
various
local
reasons
the
internal
struggle
was
more
acute
and
the
violence
much
greater
there
a
board
of
customs
commissioners
was
now
seated
in
boston
and
thus
the
duties
on
glass
paper
colors
and
tea
constituted
a
more
visible
encroachment
as
in
a
more
famous
instance
several
years
later
the
massachusetts
patriots
appealed
to
the
other
colonies
and
jefferson
s
countrymen
did
not
fail
them
if
the
virginians
and
the
new
englanders
were
not
the
chief
actors
in
the
revolution
he
thought
they
were
in
february
the
house
of
representatives
of
massachusetts
bay
had
sent
to
the
other
colonial
legislatures
a
circular
letter
urging
united
action
against
the
townshend
duties
at
their
next
meeting
the
virginia
assembly
had
petitioned
the
king
and
addressed
the
lords
and
commons
and
by
direction
the
speaker
of
the
burgesses
wrote
to
the
speaker
of
the
massachusetts
house
that
the
virginia
representatives
could
not
but
applaud
them
for
their
attention
to
american
liberty
furthermore
he
spoke
of
their
own
fixed
resolution
to
concur
with
the
other
colonies
in
their
application
for
redress
judging
from
what
had
happened
already
botetourt
had
little
reason
to
hope
that
his
conciliatory
manner
would
suffice
to
detach
the
virginians
from
their
concert
with
their
brethren
to
the
north
unfortunately
the
british
authorities
had
chosen
to
make
an
issue
of
the
massachusetts
circular
they
had
ordered
it
to
be
rescinded
and
the
house
of
representatives
had
refused
the
secretary
of
state
for
the
colonies
lord
hillsborough
instructed
hapless
botetourt
and
the
other
provincial
governors
to
dissolve
any
assembly
which
approved
the
circular
furthermore
some
months
before
jefferson
attended
his
first
session
parliament
approved
this
policy
and
recommended
the
revival
of
an
old
statute
which
allowed
the
government
to
call
to
england
for
trial
persons
accused
of
treason
outside
of
the
kingdom
the
threat
was
specifically
directed
against
the
traitors
in
massachusetts
but
the
law
could
have
been
applied
to
patrick
henry
and
peyton
randolph
just
as
well
had
it
been
seriously
intended
on
the
ninth
day
of
their
session
the
burgesses
accepted
the
challenge
without
flinching
they
declared
again
that
they
not
parliament
had
the
right
to
levy
taxes
on
the
colony
they
also
asserted
the
right
of
petition
to
the
king
and
the
lawfulness
of
procuring
the
concurrence
of
the
other
colonies
as
usual
they
assured
the
king
of
their
loyalty
but
in
the
same
breath
they
asked
him
to
avert
the
dangers
and
miseries
which
would
ensue
from
the
transportation
of
anyone
to
england
to
be
tried
botetourt
had
hoped
to
conciliate
them
and
keep
them
silent
but
under
his
instructions
he
had
now
no
choice
he
was
dressed
in
scarlet
when
he
summoned
them
into
his
presence
and
said
i
have
heard
of
your
resolves
and
augur
ill
of
their
effect
you
have
made
it
my
duty
to
dissolve
you
and
you
are
dissolved
accordingly
this
was
about
noon
on
a
wednesday
with
the
greatest
order
and
decorum
the
late
representatives
of
the
people
went
immediately
to
the
apollo
room
of
the
raleigh
tavern
the
elected
peyton
randolph
moderator
and
proceeded
to
transact
highly
important
business
in
the
best
of
form
jefferson
needed
to
do
nothing
but
go
along
with
this
powerful
current
on
the
next
day
he
put
his
name
to
the
first
significant
public
paper
that
he
ever
signed
this
was
what
was
known
as
an
association
and
because
of
the
great
prestige
of
the
colony
and
the
historic
eminence
of
the
signers
it
became
one
of
the
more
famous
of
its
kind
it
was
a
nonimportation
nonconsumption
agreement
based
on
part
of
a
draft
of
george
mason
s
which
washington
had
brought
with
him
from
fairfax
county
scholarly
and
patriotic
mason
who
avoided
legislative
duties
all
he
could
was
not
there
he
had
favored
non
exportation
also
but
the
others
were
not
yet
prepared
to
go
that
far
jefferson
was
among
the
great
number
of
principal
gentlemen
of
the
colony
including
eighty
nine
of
the
late
representatives
who
signed
the
final
report
of
a
special
committee
after
it
was
approved
on
thursday
and
then
drank
toasts
to
the
king
the
governor
and
others
he
still
regarded
himself
as
a
loyal
subject
but
from
this
beginning
he
was
wholly
resolute
in
his
defense
of
colonial
rights
he
and
the
others
promised
that
they
would
not
import
and
that
after
september
they
would
not
buy
any
goods
taxed
by
parliament
for
the
purpose
of
raising
revenue
a
similar
agreement
about
a
long
list
of
other
articles
was
to
remain
binding
until
the
townshend
act
had
been
repealed
at
designated
dates
they
also
promised
to
cease
to
import
wines
and
slaves
they
set
up
no
machinery
of
enforcement
however
and
this
proved
to
be
an
ineffective
measure
it
was
an
important
gesture
and
threat
nevertheless
and
jefferson
took
it
more
seriously
than
most
unless
lord
botetourt
intended
to
dispense
with
the
assembly
altogether
and
thus
leave
routine
business
unattended
to
he
had
to
issue
writs
for
a
new
election
this
he
did
in
august
and
the
elections
were
held
in
september
as
jefferson
remembered
the
only
casualties
were
among
the
very
few
burgesses
who
had
dared
dissent
from
the
opinions
of
the
dominating
group
in
the
courthouse
at
charlottesville
he
himself
was
returned
by
the
voice
of
the
freeholders
of
albemarle
his
legislative
career
had
lasted
only
ten
days
so
far
but
having
survived
an
election
he
was
now
a
veteran
of
sorts
his
second
session
in
november
and
december
of
this
year
was
interrupted
by
no
crisis
and
lasted
about
six
weeks
he
served
on
more
committees
this
time
but
like
the
others
he
was
largely
occupied
with
routine
affairs
such
as
individual
petitions
and
bills
for
the
docking
of
entails
on
land
so
far
as
imperial
relations
were
concerned
this
meeting
was
serene
and
lord
botetourt
basked
in
the
sunshine
of
popularity
no
penalties
had
been
imposed
on
the
burgesses
because
of
the
actions
of
last
may
this
was
one
of
many
instances
of
the
inconsistent
and
vacillating
policy
of
the
unstable
ministry
in
england
after
having
uttered
unnecessary
threats
as
edmund
burke
pointed
out
the
ministers
now
knelt
to
be
kicked
in
virginia
it
was
courtly
lord
botetourt
who
did
the
kneeling
and
the
burgesses
proceeded
to
bestow
on
him
not
a
kick
but
the
nearest
thing
to
a
caress
that
they
could
put
in
words
in
his
opening
address
the
governor
made
a
most
conciliatory
announcement
the
british
administration
far
from
wanting
to
impose
further
taxes
on
america
for
purposes
of
revenue
intended
to
propose
at
the
next
session
of
parliament
that
the
duties
on
glass
paper
and
colors
be
taken
off
he
wisely
failed
to
speak
of
tea
and
humorously
conceding
that
the
present
ministers
were
not
immortal
he
admitted
that
their
successors
might
attempt
to
undo
their
works
but
he
did
not
believe
the
plan
would
fail
as
for
himself
he
was
willing
to
be
declared
infamous
if
he
did
not
at
all
times
in
all
places
and
upon
all
occasions
exert
every
power
to
obtain
satisfaction
for
the
colonies
the
burgesses
were
enchanted
and
jefferson
himself
believed
that
the
governor
meant
everything
he
said
the
response
to
such
an
important
announcement
was
not
entrusted
to
a
young
burgess
who
might
possibly
have
claimed
something
more
it
was
left
to
the
sage
veterans
pendleton
and
nicholas
they
expressed
gratitude
and
loyalty
to
the
king
and
they
undoubtedly
voiced
the
prevailing
sentiment
about
the
governor
himself
your
lordship
s
great
regard
and
attention
to
the
welfare
and
true
interest
of
this
colony
has
before
endeared
you
to
us
all
but
your
generous
and
noble
declarations
upon
this
occasion
demand
our
warmest
and
most
grateful
acknowledgments
the
governor
had
made
himself
the
hero
of
the
hour
and
could
hardly
have
been
denied
generous
applause
it
seemed
to
thomas
jefferson
afterwards
that
this
sort
of
thing
smacked
too
much
of
humility
and
that
while
botetourt
said
all
he
could
he
could
not
say
enough
to
certain
critics
of
the
ministry
in
the
house
of
commons
on
the
other
hand
and
among
them
men
who
had
opposed
the
townshend
duties
in
the
first
place
the
speech
and
conduct
of
the
lord
of
the
bedchamber
seemed
absurd
in
the
opinion
of
burke
and
others
he
had
said
far
too
much
he
had
laid
on
parliament
the
odium
for
imposing
burdens
and
had
given
all
the
credit
for
removing
them
to
his
king
even
lord
north
recognized
the
issue
said
he
the
language
of
america
is
we
are
the
subjects
of
the
king
with
parliament
we
have
nothing
to
do
that
is
the
point
at
which
the
factions
have
been
aiming
upon
that
they
have
been
shaking
hands
jefferson
would
have
approved
for
he
afterwards
claimed
that
he
held
this
position
from
the
first
but
there
is
no
record
that
he
said
so
publicly
until
four
years
later
and
he
believed
that
he
was
in
advance
of
public
opinions
when
he
did
meanwhile
it
was
recognized
in
england
as
in
virginia
that
botetourt
was
amiable
and
much
beloved
he
was
a
man
around
whom
pleasant
stories
gathered
from
his
friend
anne
blair
jefferson
could
have
heard
one
which
ought
to
have
appealed
to
his
musician
s
heart
whether
or
not
he
loved
a
lord
one
summer
evening
as
the
blairs
and
their
guests
sat
singing
on
their
steps
they
saw
a
lantern
and
candle
coming
up
the
street
the
pedestrians
soon
stopped
as
though
to
listen
and
the
music
abruptly
ceased
whereupon
a
voice
called
out
charming
charming
proceed
for
god
s
sake
or
i
go
home
directly
then
all
sprang
up
and
the
air
echoed
with
pray
walk
in
my
lord
no
he
would
not
do
that
but
he
would
sit
on
the
steps
beside
them
this
he
did
till
the
party
broke
up
and
the
guests
went
home
in
december
the
speaker
and
the
burgesses
gave
a
party
at
the
illuminated
capitol
to
botetourt
which
jefferson
was
entitled
to
attend
it
was
noted
that
the
patriotic
spent
which
had
given
rise
to
the
association
of
gentlemen
in
raleigh
tavern
was
now
manifested
by
the
ladies
at
the
capitol
nearly
a
hundred
of
them
came
in
homespun
gowns
they
undoubtedly
fluttered
about
his
lordship
who
had
no
lady
of
his
own
at
the
palace
but
managed
nevertheless
to
give
splendid
entertainment
there
jefferson
was
one
of
those
who
regarded
the
struggle
with
the
british
authorities
as
far
from
over
the
duty
on
tea
remained
and
was
supported
by
the
ministry
in
parliament
on
the
ground
that
the
mother
country
must
retain
the
right
to
tax
the
practical
inconvenience
to
the
colonies
might
now
be
slight
as
lord
north
said
but
the
principle
for
which
the
more
aggressive
patriots
had
contended
had
been
denied
throughout
the
preliminaries
of
the
revolution
jefferson
kept
principles
clearly
in
mind
and
the
action
which
he
took
in
june
illustrates
the
point
he
then
signed
another
association
agreement
which
was
to
be
binding
until
the
offensive
act
of
parliament
had
been
totally
repealed
or
a
meeting
of
one
hundred
associators
had
provided
otherwise
this
agreement
which
was
made
by
a
large
group
of
burgesses
and
local
merchants
during
the
spring
session
of
the
assembly
went
further
than
that
of
the
previous
year
by
setting
up
county
committees
of
enforcement
it
soon
appeared
however
that
these
could
not
be
genuinely
effective
since
the
spirit
of
association
had
everywhere
declined
it
was
during
this
session
that
lord
botetourt
signed
jefferson
s
commission
as
lieutenant
of
albemarle
and
chief
commander
of
the
militia
there
thus
at
the
age
of
twenty
seven
he
became
the
ranking
official
of
his
county
and
could
be
called
colonel
his
service
in
this
important
post
may
not
have
been
continuous
but
he
was
occupying
it
when
war
actually
broke
out
and
colonel
jefferson
then
concerned
himself
diligently
with
military
affairs
he
did
not
see
much
more
of
botetourt
for
in
october
the
genial
baron
was
gathered
to
his
fathers
jefferson
was
then
in
williamsburg
attending
the
general
court
and
no
doubt
was
present
at
the
funeral
services
in
bruton
church
and
in
the
college
chapel
where
the
remains
were
interred
the
ceremonies
were
the
most
elaborate
that
had
ever
been
seen
in
virginia
and
are
reputed
to
have
cost
seven
hundred
pounds
sterling
also
he
was
a
member
of
the
assembly
which
afterwards
voted
that
an
elegant
statue
of
this
much
mourned
gentleman
be
erected
in
marble
at
public
expense
this
statue
later
became
a
landmark
and
caused
the
memory
of
his
lordship
to
remain
green
in
williamsburg
jefferson
afterwards
viewed
the
death
of
botetourt
which
had
seemed
so
tragically
untimely
as
a
fortunate
event
for
the
cause
of
the
revolution
he
believed
that
if
this
conciliatory
courtier
had
lived
on
he
would
have
been
able
to
embarrass
the
measures
of
the
patriots
greatly
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
virginia
countrymen
had
fallen
into
a
sad
state
of
insensibility
to
their
actual
situation
not
only
was
the
tea
tax
unrepealed
the
declaratory
act
by
which
parliament
had
asserted
the
right
to
bind
the
colonists
by
their
laws
in
all
cases
whatsoever
still
hung
suspended
over
them
like
the
sword
of
damocles
others
than
he
had
noted
the
cooling
of
the
spirit
of
association
because
of
the
defection
of
the
northern
provinces
some
people
said
a
meeting
of
associators
was
called
for
december
but
so
few
met
that
they
could
do
nothing
but
adjourn
until
summer
jefferson
was
in
williamsburg
that
day
and
was
probably
numbered
among
these
few
he
continued
longer
than
most
people
to
be
scrupulous
about
the
agreement
into
which
he
had
entered
in
the
year
as
a
prospective
bridegroom
he
particularly
wanted
building
materials
and
furnishings
and
fine
clothes
not
until
june
however
did
he
feel
free
to
authorize
his
agent
in
england
to
purchase
certain
articles
which
had
been
previously
prohibited
as
a
public
man
he
had
now
come
into
a
barren
period
of
all
the
sessions
of
the
house
of
burgesses
that
he
attended
before
his
marriage
his
first
was
much
the
most
exciting
following
the
boston
massacre
there
was
a
reaction
against
patriotic
activities
even
in
boston
and
the
virginians
had
no
other
burning
grievances
for
several
years
the
time
for
him
to
appear
as
a
rebel
had
not
yet
arrived
but
it
was
as
inevitable
as
anything
can
be
that
he
would
take
his
stand
against
what
he
regarded
as
tyranny
for
the
spirit
of
liberty
was
the
essence
of
his
mind
during
his
early
legislative
career
he
said
he
made
an
effort
for
the
emancipation
of
slaves
which
came
to
nothing
whether
he
made
or
seconded
an
abortive
motion
which
was
not
entered
on
the
record
or
his
memory
was
at
fault
in
regard
to
the
form
of
his
proposal
undoubtedly
he
already
had
a
strong
desire
to
mitigate
the
evils
of
slavery
but
as
he
reflected
nothing
liberal
could
then
expect
success
he
was
still
living
in
the
dull
monotony
of
a
colonial
subservience
and
both
as
a
local
patriot
and
a
humanitarian
he
had
to
wait
for
a
more
propitious
hour
momentarily
he
had
to
combat
ills
created
by
the
forces
of
nature
the
great
fresh
of
destroyed
many
other
things
besides
his
mill
that
summer
he
attended
a
special
session
of
the
assembly
which
president
william
nelson
had
called
on
account
of
the
general
devastation
he
was
again
in
williamsburg
in
october
when
still
another
governor
arrived
lord
dunmore
was
fated
to
arouse
controversy
not
to
compose
it
there
could
be
no
valid
objection
however
when
he
dissolved
the
assembly
in
late
november
jefferson
was
re
elected
b
the
freeholders
while
his
contemporary
john
walker
was
chosen
in
place
of
his
father
during
this
same
year
however
jefferson
declined
to
serve
longer
on
the
county
court
and
when
the
new
assembly
finally
met
in
february
he
was
not
there
by
that
date
he
had
married
and
for
several
years
he
had
been
building
a
house
colonial
rights
might
still
be
in
jeopardy
but
supremely
important
personal
matters
had
to
be
attended
to
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
settle
down
xi
beginning
at
monticello
by
the
year
that
he
began
to
practise
law
jefferson
had
given
a
name
to
the
little
mountain
across
the
rivanna
from
shadwell
and
had
started
to
graft
cherry
trees
there
he
had
translated
little
mountain
into
italian
a
language
he
was
now
familiar
with
and
undoubtedly
he
pronounced
the
word
in
the
italian
manner
a
month
after
his
twenty
fifth
birthday
he
made
an
agreement
for
leveling
the
top
of
this
elevated
place
and
by
this
time
if
not
earlier
he
had
decided
to
build
a
house
there
not
yet
however
did
he
know
who
was
goings
to
live
in
it
besides
himself
in
the
year
he
entered
the
house
of
burgesses
laborers
of
his
began
to
dig
a
cellar
in
the
stiff
mountain
clay
the
work
which
he
thus
inaugurated
he
continued
for
ten
or
twelve
years
he
returned
to
it
as
a
new
task
a
decade
after
that
and
the
building
of
the
mansion
at
monticello
in
its
historic
form
proved
to
be
little
short
of
a
lifetime
s
work
nothing
else
that
he
ever
did
was
more
characteristic
of
him
as
a
person
and
a
mind
in
spirit
he
was
pre
eminently
constructive
and
he
could
not
think
of
himself
or
of
his
house
or
of
human
society
as
finished
but
he
was
not
merely
creating
an
architectural
or
intellectual
monument
he
was
a
deeply
domestic
being
making
a
home
throughout
his
maturity
his
spirit
ceaselessly
roamed
the
universe
searching
out
the
good
things
in
it
but
his
heart
was
on
his
mountaintop
and
if
his
ghost
now
walks
it
is
surely
there
few
activities
interested
him
more
than
building
and
it
is
unfortunate
that
the
scanty
early
records
do
not
reveal
just
when
this
interest
was
manifested
first
the
natural
supposition
is
that
as
an
enthusiastic
boy
at
home
from
school
he
watched
the
building
operations
that
his
father
was
carrying
on
at
shadwell
and
observed
peter
jefferson
at
the
drawing
board
it
is
said
that
while
he
was
in
college
he
got
his
first
work
on
architecture
from
an
old
cabinetmaker
and
as
a
law
student
he
may
have
picked
up
ideas
and
books
from
richard
taliaferro
father
in
law
of
george
wythe
who
was
called
an
architect
at
the
time
and
was
certainly
a
builder
the
study
of
architecture
for
purposes
of
personal
improvement
was
quite
in
accord
with
the
tradition
of
the
renaissance
as
perpetuated
in
england
and
in
that
country
this
was
pre
eminently
the
age
of
the
gentleman
amateur
in
his
own
developing
region
jefferson
became
notable
for
his
knowledge
of
the
arts
but
his
consuming
interest
in
architecture
began
not
with
his
concern
for
culture
but
with
his
desire
to
engage
in
actual
construction
or
to
help
his
friends
do
so
he
had
to
be
his
own
designer
and
builder
but
he
considerably
surpassed
amateur
standards
before
he
was
through
and
he
soon
came
to
be
regarded
by
his
local
contemporaries
as
an
authority
it
is
possible
that
he
designed
other
houses
before
he
did
his
own
though
the
first
full
chapter
of
his
architectural
story
was
written
in
the
bricks
and
mortar
of
monticello
to
many
at
the
time
it
must
have
seemed
that
his
personal
project
was
impracticable
in
deciding
to
establish
a
plantation
seat
on
such
a
height
he
was
following
no
precedent
that
could
be
found
in
virginia
or
in
england
for
that
matter
and
he
appeared
to
be
flying
in
the
face
of
common
sense
the
difficulties
in
carrying
on
construction
in
such
a
place
were
immense
the
woods
were
thick
much
grading
had
to
be
done
in
stubborn
soil
and
besides
the
building
materials
themselves
water
had
to
be
brought
to
the
hilltop
at
first
he
had
to
figure
with
exactitude
just
how
much
of
it
was
required
his
choice
of
a
site
does
not
show
that
he
was
an
impractical
theorist
for
in
the
course
of
time
he
actually
worked
out
his
problems
it
does
show
however
that
he
had
not
disciplined
his
mind
to
the
loss
of
imagination
and
events
proved
that
in
matters
connected
with
his
home
he
was
least
disposed
to
count
the
labor
and
the
cost
his
choice
also
revealed
a
sensitiveness
to
natural
beauty
which
he
did
not
often
express
in
words
his
eye
like
his
mind
sought
an
extended
view
from
this
spot
he
could
see
to
the
eastward
an
expanse
of
forested
country
rolling
like
the
sea
and
to
the
westward
he
could
look
across
the
treetops
to
a
mountain
wall
of
lavender
and
blue
the
lesser
and
scattered
intervening
hills
flattened
out
somewhat
when
viewed
from
this
eminence
but
the
country
was
little
marred
by
the
hand
of
man
as
yet
and
the
prospect
was
majestic
though
not
quite
stupendous
the
eye
could
ask
for
nothing
better
except
for
the
presence
of
a
body
of
shimmering
water
despite
what
he
had
done
for
it
the
rivanna
was
not
that
according
to
the
agreement
a
plot
on
the
northeast
end
of
the
mountain
was
to
be
leveled
by
christmas
and
be
paid
for
in
wheat
and
corn
in
the
spring
jefferson
was
planting
fruit
trees
on
the
southeast
hillside
spacing
them
properly
in
an
almost
ideal
spot
the
excavations
of
were
for
the
foundations
of
the
first
outbuilding
by
summer
he
had
arranged
for
the
molding
and
burning
of
brick
and
had
set
a
man
digging
a
well
by
early
fall
he
had
laid
out
on
the
north
side
of
the
mountain
a
park
more
than
a
mile
in
circumference
had
ordered
chesnut
rails
to
be
mawled
and
had
arranged
for
a
friend
who
was
sailing
for
england
to
buy
articles
for
the
house
there
his
house
plans
were
still
tentative
the
first
thing
he
had
done
was
to
get
a
few
drawings
of
other
dwellings
crudely
executed
by
other
hands
he
could
not
hope
to
find
satisfactory
models
in
his
immediate
locality
and
even
when
he
surveyed
the
entire
province
most
of
the
private
houses
seemed
to
him
ugly
and
uncomfortable
he
thought
it
fortunate
that
they
were
perishable
they
were
generally
of
wood
and
in
reaching
his
own
early
decision
to
use
brick
he
had
to
combat
a
strong
contemporary
prejudice
against
it
because
of
the
belief
that
rain
could
less
easily
penetrate
wooden
walls
he
wanted
to
employ
durable
materials
and
to
contribute
to
permanent
improvement
there
were
expensive
mansions
in
virginia
at
that
time
rosewell
which
he
visited
so
often
was
fabulously
so
and
westover
and
carter
s
grove
which
he
must
have
known
were
places
of
note
but
after
he
had
informed
himself
about
what
had
been
done
in
other
lands
he
was
convinced
that
the
first
principles
of
the
art
of
building
were
unknown
in
the
colony
and
that
scarcely
a
model
existed
sufficiently
chaste
to
give
an
idea
of
them
to
the
twentieth
century
observer
of
mellow
river
mansions
and
restored
williamsburg
his
strictures
seem
much
too
severe
and
his
standards
rather
arbitrary
all
the
domestic
architecture
of
virginia
prior
to
the
building
of
monticello
cannot
be
thus
dismissed
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
he
probably
did
not
have
quite
such
strong
feelings
about
local
houses
in
as
he
did
when
he
definitely
expressed
them
a
dozen
years
later
but
at
the
very
beginning
his
tastes
and
ambitions
caused
him
to
search
for
better
examples
elsewhere
it
is
not
at
all
surprising
therefore
that
he
turned
to
books
that
was
a
common
practice
when
anyone
wanted
to
build
better
than
the
average
and
he
could
not
have
been
expected
to
blossom
forth
spontaneously
as
a
creative
designer
in
his
middle
twenties
his
distinction
lay
in
the
fact
that
he
referred
to
more
books
than
others
did
that
he
went
beyond
british
works
to
more
remote
sources
that
he
attained
results
which
accorded
with
his
own
superior
tastes
and
special
needs
his
first
collection
of
architectural
works
was
notable
in
his
locality
and
it
was
representative
of
more
than
one
of
the
trends
and
fashions
of
his
times
he
was
most
influenced
however
by
english
architects
who
had
imitated
palladio
and
by
the
great
italian
himself
who
had
gone
back
to
roman
antiquity
for
his
models
and
his
rules
thus
did
a
freedom
loving
and
forward
looking
american
attach
himself
to
a
school
which
found
its
inspiration
in
the
distant
past
and
which
now
impresses
one
as
dogmatic
it
may
seem
that
some
explanation
is
called
for
the
facts
themselves
as
they
appeared
in
the
last
third
of
the
eighteenth
century
can
be
left
to
speak
for
themselves
but
something
may
be
said
here
in
regard
to
the
developing
architectural
philosophy
of
jefferson
like
most
other
men
he
was
not
all
of
a
piece
but
in
this
instance
the
alleged
inconsistency
is
more
apparent
than
real
liberty
was
never
anarchy
to
him
but
freedom
to
seek
the
truth
it
seemed
proper
enough
that
there
should
be
rules
in
architecture
as
there
were
laws
in
nature
and
rules
were
exceedingly
useful
to
a
young
gentleman
amateur
on
the
edge
of
civilization
who
wanted
to
build
a
house
if
that
structure
had
not
been
harmonious
within
itself
restrained
and
symmetrically
proportioned
it
would
not
have
been
a
fitting
habitation
for
him
or
at
least
for
the
sort
of
man
he
aspired
to
be
what
he
valued
most
in
classical
antiquity
he
prized
in
architecture
simplicity
serenity
and
reserve
coupled
with
the
sort
of
dignity
which
seemed
appropriate
to
his
majestic
site
for
what
he
wanted
he
now
turned
not
to
the
more
monumental
works
of
palladio
but
to
the
country
style
of
his
lesser
villas
he
probably
introduced
himself
to
certain
english
disciples
of
palladio
such
as
james
gibbs
and
robert
morris
before
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
master
himself
one
of
the
books
by
gibbs
which
he
acquired
among
the
first
gave
rules
for
architectural
drawing
and
measurement
which
were
better
than
those
generally
available
to
american
builders
and
he
followed
these
until
he
found
others
that
seemed
superior
as
his
father
s
son
he
took
to
mechanical
drawing
his
procedure
was
that
of
the
drafts
man
not
the
freehand
artist
and
at
this
stage
he
drew
not
with
pencil
but
wholly
with
ink
his
mind
was
mathematical
and
he
had
a
penchant
for
precision
this
was
one
reason
though
not
the
only
one
why
he
was
so
greatly
attracted
to
andrea
palladio
from
the
time
that
he
discovered
him
a
person
of
jefferson
s
classical
training
must
have
been
impressed
by
the
information
that
the
italian
had
examined
the
stately
monuments
of
old
rome
with
unparalleled
diligence
and
attention
thus
making
himself
the
master
of
the
noblest
ideas
of
the
ancients
it
was
claimed
that
palladio
walking
through
the
rubbish
had
discovered
the
true
rules
of
an
art
which
till
his
time
were
unknown
he
probably
seemed
to
his
disciples
the
newton
of
architecture
though
jefferson
never
placed
him
quite
that
high
in
the
works
of
this
master
however
jefferson
found
rules
for
the
proportions
of
the
five
orders
along
with
various
other
measurements
and
as
time
went
on
he
refigured
the
proportions
of
his
own
house
accordingly
nor
could
he
fail
to
perceive
the
kinship
of
spirit
between
the
distinguished
son
of
vicenza
and
himself
in
his
first
chapter
palladio
quoted
vitruvius
in
regard
to
the
chief
desiderata
in
a
building
conveniency
solidity
and
beauty
then
he
said
as
for
the
beauty
of
an
edifice
it
consists
of
an
exact
proportion
of
the
parts
within
themselves
and
of
each
part
with
the
whole
for
a
fine
building
ought
to
appear
as
an
entire
and
perfect
body
wherein
every
member
agrees
with
its
fellow
and
each
so
well
with
the
whole
that
it
may
seem
absolutely
necessary
to
the
being
of
the
same
there
is
here
no
denial
of
the
freedom
of
the
mind
to
reach
its
own
conclusions
but
the
strong
hope
is
held
out
that
the
order
and
harmony
which
jefferson
was
seeking
might
be
found
the
design
of
the
main
house
which
jefferson
decided
on
about
shows
distinct
traces
of
palladian
influence
but
it
went
back
to
his
own
earlier
more
conventional
and
more
practical
plan
of
a
central
mass
with
wings
to
this
he
afterwards
added
octagonal
bays
or
projections
which
may
have
been
inspired
by
the
select
architecture
of
robert
morris
if
he
did
draw
plans
for
other
dwellings
before
his
own
the
best
case
can
be
made
for
the
harrison
place
brandon
which
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
one
of
morris
s
plates
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
he
used
some
of
the
designs
of
this
english
architect
as
starting
points
at
this
and
other
times
and
from
him
he
could
also
have
received
counsels
of
moderation
in
ornament
i
think
a
building
well
proportioned
without
dress
will
ever
please
said
morris
as
a
plain
coat
may
sit
as
graceful
and
easy
on
a
well
proportioned
man
but
if
you
will
be
lavish
in
ornament
your
structure
will
look
rather
like
a
fop
with
a
superfluity
of
gaudy
tinsel
than
a
real
decoration
fundamentally
jefferson
was
austere
he
preferred
chaste
architectural
models
and
he
worked
out
his
proportions
mathematically
before
he
drew
his
plans
in
ink
he
was
not
an
unbridled
genius
in
this
or
any
other
field
there
was
nothing
lawless
about
him
despite
his
pioneering
bent
he
was
unusually
scholarly
and
painstaking
and
at
the
same
time
receptive
and
he
had
a
rare
gift
of
adaptation
which
constituted
a
form
of
originality
he
provided
for
his
personal
needs
with
ingenuity
and
at
monticello
he
did
not
slavishly
follow
any
single
guide
the
elevation
which
he
drew
before
showed
a
central
portico
of
two
orders
the
stronger
doric
capitals
supporting
the
ionic
columns
as
palladio
had
prescribed
this
drawing
is
impressive
but
it
has
an
unfamiliar
look
to
modern
visitors
for
the
upper
columns
were
never
placed
by
the
year
of
his
marriage
he
had
also
worked
out
a
general
plan
including
the
dependencies
almost
anyone
who
has
been
to
monticello
can
recognize
this
for
it
was
largely
carried
out
in
the
course
of
time
it
was
a
country
scheme
such
as
had
great
vogue
in
eighteenth
century
england
and
was
strongly
reminiscent
of
palladio
the
idea
was
to
connect
the
supporting
buildings
keeping
them
under
one
roof
for
the
convenience
of
the
owner
jefferson
once
flirted
with
the
idea
of
having
offices
run
all
around
the
mountaintop
but
abandoned
it
as
grandiose
he
now
planned
a
succession
of
rooms
in
two
l
shaped
blocks
connecting
with
the
main
house
and
each
terminating
in
a
square
outbuilding
after
studying
the
lay
of
his
land
he
decided
to
take
advantage
of
the
slope
by
sinking
the
service
rooms
below
the
level
of
the
main
structure
covering
them
with
terraces
and
having
them
open
outwards
rather
than
upon
the
inner
court
his
adaptation
of
the
scheme
was
individual
but
in
putting
the
meanest
rooms
out
of
sight
he
was
following
the
counsel
of
the
master
palladio
drew
an
analogy
from
the
human
body
which
contains
some
noble
and
beautiful
members
and
others
which
though
useful
are
ugly
and
disagreeable
then
he
reverently
said
but
as
our
blessed
lord
has
ordered
our
members
so
as
to
make
the
finest
of
them
to
be
the
most
exposed
to
sight
and
concealing
them
that
are
not
seemingly
so
just
so
we
must
contrive
a
building
in
such
a
manner
that
the
finest
and
most
noble
parts
of
it
be
the
most
exposed
to
public
view
and
the
less
agreeable
disposed
in
by
places
and
removed
from
sight
as
much
as
possible
the
major
danger
was
that
comfort
and
convenience
would
be
sacrificed
to
stateliness
by
putting
kitchen
pantries
wood
houses
laundries
servants
quarters
and
the
like
too
far
away
there
was
reason
to
put
them
at
a
distance
in
those
days
for
there
were
no
screens
and
jefferson
had
plenty
of
domestic
servants
to
carry
things
to
and
fro
accordingly
the
housewife
s
objection
to
his
placing
the
basement
kitchen
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
house
from
the
dining
room
would
not
have
been
so
quickly
raised
then
as
now
on
the
other
hand
it
would
have
been
unfortunate
if
he
had
placed
his
stables
under
the
northwest
wing
as
he
once
planned
actually
he
kept
them
at
a
greater
distance
and
eventually
used
that
wing
chiefly
for
coaches
and
an
icehouse
he
did
not
get
around
to
building
his
terraces
until
after
the
revolution
nor
did
he
put
up
at
the
turns
the
chinese
temples
he
once
considered
or
the
octagons
with
domes
like
those
at
lord
burlington
s
famous
house
at
chiswick
which
he
afterwards
preferred
he
was
not
without
romantic
impulses
but
prudence
and
practical
necessities
imposed
restraint
the
first
structure
that
he
erected
was
one
of
the
outbuildings
often
referred
to
as
the
southeast
pavilion
he
moved
to
this
simple
brick
building
in
the
november
after
the
house
at
shadwell
burned
here
he
had
parlor
kitchen
hall
bed
chamber
and
study
all
in
one
hither
as
tradition
has
it
he
brought
his
bride
probably
no
part
of
the
main
house
was
completed
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
they
were
still
making
and
laying
bricks
after
the
declaration
of
independence
and
as
late
as
jefferson
contracted
for
stone
columns
the
house
was
not
wholly
done
in
when
the
british
rode
up
the
mountain
and
it
was
remodeled
extensively
fifteen
years
after
that
he
had
only
begun
to
create
an
architectural
monument
when
he
became
a
husband
what
mrs
jefferson
came
to
was
only
a
mansion
in
the
making
on
paper
the
house
proper
had
five
rooms
on
the
first
floor
after
the
octagonal
projections
were
added
these
consisted
of
a
central
parlor
or
saloon
with
a
dining
room
and
bow
room
on
one
side
and
a
bedroom
and
dressing
room
on
the
other
the
precise
form
of
the
second
floor
is
uncertain
but
presumably
the
large
library
over
the
parlor
was
flanked
with
bedrooms
according
to
palladio
the
conveniency
of
a
house
consisted
in
its
suitability
to
the
quality
of
its
master
in
the
common
meaning
of
the
term
the
house
at
monticello
was
not
for
some
time
a
convenient
one
if
it
ever
was
really
and
amid
all
the
clatter
of
construction
it
must
have
lacked
the
tranquillity
which
its
owner
so
greatly
prized
those
who
knew
the
workings
of
his
mind
however
must
have
observed
as
a
contemporary
did
that
in
his
locality
he
took
pride
in
running
before
his
times
and
that
he
purposed
to
assume
a
style
of
living
more
refined
than
had
been
handed
down
to
him
by
his
own
ancestors
or
was
practised
by
his
contemporaries
in
the
province
in
polite
learning
the
second
william
byrd
may
have
been
his
equal
and
as
a
man
of
the
world
his
superior
but
as
a
man
of
both
taste
and
learning
he
had
no
contemporary
or
historic
rival
in
virginia
in
more
senses
than
one
he
had
set
himself
upon
a
mountain
yet
he
was
never
one
who
desired
to
be
gazed
at
he
sought
privacy
as
well
as
elevation
and
he
had
good
reason
to
expect
it
in
this
inaccessible
place
his
joy
was
in
a
new
creation
america
itself
was
that
as
he
said
later
at
least
in
comparison
with
europe
it
was
built
on
a
better
plan
the
time
for
effective
political
planning
was
not
yet
come
but
he
could
create
an
appropriate
setting
for
the
sort
of
life
he
aspired
to
live
whether
he
was
in
any
strict
sense
original
does
not
matter
he
was
trying
to
bring
to
this
new
country
the
best
wisdom
of
his
age
and
in
the
attempt
to
solve
his
own
problems
he
figured
things
out
in
advance
with
a
diligence
and
exactitude
which
were
unparalleled
in
his
native
society
nothing
was
too
small
to
excite
his
interest
and
homely
matters
concerned
him
along
with
the
artistic
he
had
planted
an
orchard
on
the
hillside
below
the
southeastern
outbuilding
before
he
established
bachelor
quarters
there
he
had
set
out
in
grafted
pears
and
apples
cherry
trees
still
to
be
inoculated
peach
stocks
on
which
he
intended
to
graft
almonds
and
quinces
and
nectarines
besides
in
the
hollow
he
had
planted
pomegranates
figs
and
walnuts
along
with
peach
stocks
to
be
inoculated
with
apricots
he
was
picking
up
bits
of
horticultural
lore
from
his
neighbors
reading
in
a
garden
dictionary
and
planting
bushels
of
clover
seed
but
he
had
not
worked
out
a
full
garden
plan
as
yet
his
mind
also
turned
to
questions
of
landscaping
but
he
never
did
have
his
retainers
dig
the
rectangular
flower
beds
behind
the
house
which
he
showed
on
his
general
plan
the
open
ground
on
the
west
seemed
to
him
to
call
for
a
shrubbery
and
for
this
he
drew
up
an
impressive
list
at
this
stage
there
was
more
immediate
need
for
thinning
trees
removing
undergrowth
and
domesticating
the
place
generally
nonetheless
he
wanted
it
to
remain
an
asylum
for
wild
animals
except
beasts
of
prey
and
he
was
already
thinking
of
procuring
a
buck
elk
to
be
monarch
of
the
wood
somewhat
later
he
did
stock
his
park
with
deer
but
he
was
not
able
to
do
much
with
landscaping
for
many
years
the
suggestions
which
he
wrote
down
in
his
account
book
are
of
chief
interest
here
because
they
show
that
for
all
his
classicism
he
was
eclectic
in
his
tastes
he
thought
of
chinese
ornaments
as
well
as
grecian
and
was
not
even
averse
to
gothic
most
striking
and
startling
of
all
were
the
alternative
plans
which
he
set
down
for
a
burying
place
the
one
that
he
established
later
was
a
great
deal
simpler
than
either
of
these
he
now
recorded
in
his
account
book
the
latin
epitaph
which
he
had
written
for
his
sister
jane
along
with
mournful
poetic
bits
from
both
latin
and
english
as
a
literary
being
he
was
not
untouched
by
the
sentimental
melancholy
of
his
time
but
the
sad
reveries
of
this
highly
intellectual
young
planter
could
have
been
more
easily
explained
by
almost
any
observant
person
who
had
attained
maturity
the
simplest
statement
of
his
case
though
not
necessarily
a
complete
one
is
that
he
was
in
love
and
needed
a
wife
it
was
fortunate
that
he
did
not
have
to
wait
for
one
much
longer
xii
attaining
domestic
felicity
about
the
time
that
he
moved
to
monticello
and
set
up
bachelor
quarters
in
the
first
outbuilding
there
jefferson
began
to
make
regular
visits
to
a
place
in
charles
city
county
called
the
forest
where
there
was
an
attractive
young
widow
to
say
that
he
paid
court
to
her
is
to
be
quite
precise
for
he
lived
in
a
courtly
age
and
this
shy
and
reserved
man
tended
to
be
formalistic
in
social
matters
as
in
architecture
his
attitude
toward
love
and
marriage
was
strictly
conventional
and
his
early
manner
toward
women
was
stilted
this
was
a
real
romance
nevertheless
and
his
marriage
to
martha
wayles
skelton
on
new
year
s
day
ushered
in
the
happiest
period
of
his
life
external
circumstances
cast
some
shadows
on
the
domestic
scene
during
the
next
ten
years
but
the
atmosphere
was
one
of
unusual
spiritual
serenity
he
never
had
the
slightest
doubt
that
he
was
well
mated
this
genuine
love
match
was
preceded
by
an
uncertain
affair
which
jefferson
himself
described
afterwards
as
improper
his
relations
with
his
neighbor
mrs
john
walker
were
unknown
or
unnoticed
at
the
time
but
they
were
widely
advertised
years
later
when
he
was
a
conspicuous
target
of
scurrilous
attacks
as
a
notorious
episode
this
story
really
belongs
to
his
history
as
president
when
he
was
several
times
a
grandfather
but
the
events
themselves
fell
within
a
period
when
he
was
young
and
only
locally
prominent
the
known
facts
should
be
stated
here
though
their
importance
must
not
be
exaggerated
he
had
served
as
an
attendant
at
the
wedding
of
john
walker
and
elizabeth
betsey
moore
at
the
age
of
twenty
one
jack
walker
was
not
quite
the
same
sort
of
friend
as
john
page
and
dabney
carr
but
he
had
been
intimate
with
jefferson
from
their
days
at
maury
s
school
they
had
been
at
college
together
and
they
loved
each
other
jack
said
dr
thomas
walker
of
castle
hill
his
father
was
one
of
peter
jefferson
s
executors
he
advanced
some
of
his
own
money
to
his
ward
when
the
latter
went
to
william
and
mary
though
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
this
was
not
repaid
betsey
was
the
daughter
of
colonel
bernard
moore
and
two
of
her
brothers
were
at
the
college
in
jefferson
s
time
the
young
couple
eventually
settled
down
at
belvoir
on
the
old
nicholas
meriwether
estate
five
or
six
miles
from
shadwell
jefferson
not
only
continued
to
be
intimate
with
walker
he
gave
elaborate
advice
to
one
of
bittersweets
brothers
about
the
study
of
law
and
became
good
friends
with
colonel
moore
from
whom
he
got
garden
items
and
at
whose
home
chelsea
in
king
william
county
he
visited
it
was
in
the
year
he
was
twenty
five
that
jefferson
made
a
mistake
he
was
then
unmarried
full
of
physical
strength
and
vigor
and
for
four
months
his
friend
was
away
from
home
john
walker
was
attending
a
conference
with
the
indians
at
fort
stanwix
and
acting
as
a
clerk
of
the
virginia
delegation
of
which
his
father
was
a
member
before
he
left
he
made
his
will
naming
jefferson
first
among
his
executors
and
he
entrusted
his
wife
and
baby
daughter
to
this
friend
s
special
care
it
was
just
after
his
return
that
jefferson
was
elected
to
the
house
of
burgesses
with
dr
thomas
walker
a
generation
afterwards
john
said
that
during
his
absence
jefferson
s
conduct
towards
mrs
walker
was
improper
and
the
president
of
the
united
states
candidly
admitted
to
certain
particular
friends
that
at
one
time
it
was
singling
it
out
from
the
other
accusations
which
his
enemies
had
hurled
against
him
he
said
this
privately
i
plead
guilty
to
one
of
their
charges
that
when
young
and
single
i
offered
love
to
a
handsome
lady
i
acknowledge
its
incorrectness
also
when
he
was
in
his
sixties
he
did
what
he
could
in
private
to
make
amends
to
his
alienated
friend
and
to
relieve
walker
s
mind
in
a
time
of
embarrassing
publicity
by
exculpating
the
lady
from
all
blame
such
action
was
in
full
accord
with
his
strict
code
of
manners
and
morals
jefferson
s
incorrect
conduct
was
not
reported
to
the
injured
husband
in
however
or
soon
afterwards
and
the
natural
supposition
is
that
the
lady
did
not
regard
the
offense
as
grave
jefferson
continued
to
be
intimate
with
walker
and
with
various
close
relatives
of
his
and
only
two
or
three
years
after
this
as
one
of
five
trustees
he
offered
for
sale
certain
lands
belonging
to
bittersweets
father
in
order
to
pay
the
colonel
s
debts
for
a
decade
and
half
longer
his
standing
in
this
circle
was
of
the
best
it
was
not
until
after
he
had
gone
to
france
in
that
mrs
walker
told
her
husband
about
jefferson
s
designs
on
her
when
he
was
at
a
safe
distance
she
unfolded
a
lurid
story
of
base
transactions
in
and
when
he
was
still
a
bachelor
and
extending
into
when
he
had
been
for
some
years
a
married
man
as
walker
wrote
it
all
down
fifteen
or
twenty
years
after
he
got
the
report
it
was
a
disgusting
tale
which
bore
the
marks
of
gross
and
willful
exaggeration
whatever
may
have
been
the
cause
in
the
absence
of
other
testimony
such
an
incredible
story
cannot
be
accepted
in
detail
all
we
can
be
sure
of
is
that
jefferson
made
advances
of
some
sort
to
his
friend
s
wife
while
he
himself
was
single
that
he
deeply
regretted
his
actions
afterwards
and
that
he
accepted
all
the
blame
he
may
possibly
have
erred
more
than
once
in
his
youthful
ardor
but
this
sensitive
man
was
not
bold
toward
women
and
the
awkward
maneuvers
which
mrs
walker
reported
suggest
none
of
the
accomplishments
of
a
rake
he
was
much
more
in
character
as
a
devoted
husband
and
kind
father
than
as
an
aggressive
lover
and
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
he
would
have
persisted
in
the
face
of
rebuffs
at
any
age
he
generally
observed
the
proprieties
almost
to
the
point
of
stiffness
he
was
notably
loyal
to
his
friends
and
there
is
no
reason
whatever
to
question
his
complete
fidelity
to
his
own
wife
he
would
have
been
in
a
safer
position
however
if
he
had
got
her
sooner
than
he
did
when
he
was
nearly
twenty
nine
in
virginia
as
a
rule
people
did
not
wait
as
long
as
jefferson
did
to
marry
his
delay
had
distinct
advantages
besides
some
dangers
for
it
enabled
him
to
devote
himself
to
his
studies
and
to
his
profession
to
a
degree
which
would
have
been
difficult
in
wedded
life
by
the
year
that
the
house
at
shadwell
burned
however
he
was
aware
that
as
a
bachelor
he
had
missed
many
joys
his
friend
and
brother
in
law
dabney
carr
had
not
yet
proceeded
as
far
along
the
road
to
professional
success
and
public
prominence
as
he
had
and
may
have
had
a
harder
time
making
ends
meet
yet
jefferson
believed
that
the
husband
of
his
sister
martha
in
a
very
small
house
with
a
table
half
a
dozen
chairs
and
one
or
two
servants
was
the
happiest
man
in
the
universe
utterly
neglecting
the
costly
apparatus
of
life
carr
spoke
thought
and
dreamed
of
nothing
but
his
young
son
this
was
a
boy
named
peter
who
was
born
that
year
and
of
whom
we
shall
hear
again
jefferson
did
not
then
know
that
he
himself
would
never
have
a
son
for
long
on
the
contrary
he
soon
had
reason
to
believe
that
he
would
acquire
one
ready
made
for
martha
wayles
skelton
had
one
she
was
five
and
a
half
years
younger
than
he
and
at
eighteen
had
married
bathurst
skelton
who
had
followed
him
in
college
her
son
john
was
born
when
she
was
nineteen
and
less
than
a
year
after
that
she
became
a
widow
and
went
back
to
her
father
s
place
in
charles
city
county
west
of
williamsburg
after
a
decent
interval
she
was
doubtless
in
the
provincial
capital
for
part
of
the
social
season
and
by
the
autumn
of
jefferson
had
probably
met
her
there
at
all
events
he
gave
jupiter
money
to
buy
hair
powder
and
buckles
for
him
that
fall
and
he
bought
many
tickets
for
the
play
perhaps
he
visited
the
forest
before
december
beyond
a
doubt
he
was
there
then
as
he
was
regularly
during
the
next
year
tipping
the
servants
with
unfailing
regularity
and
conducting
himself
generally
in
a
handsome
manner
early
in
he
made
inquiries
about
the
coat
of
arms
of
his
own
family
though
he
did
so
with
private
display
of
wit
he
asked
a
merchant
friend
who
oscillated
between
virginia
and
england
to
search
the
herald
s
office
for
him
i
have
what
i
have
been
told
were
the
family
arms
he
said
but
on
what
authority
i
know
not
it
is
possible
there
may
be
none
if
so
i
would
with
your
assistance
become
a
purchaser
having
sterne
s
word
for
it
that
a
coat
of
arms
may
be
purchased
as
cheap
as
any
other
coat
he
was
in
no
parsimonious
mood
however
and
he
did
not
scorn
the
costly
apparatus
of
life
he
purposed
to
carry
on
his
line
in
a
distinguished
manner
and
he
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
martha
belonged
to
a
wealthy
family
she
was
the
eldest
daughter
of
john
wayles
who
was
born
in
lancaster
england
and
had
acquired
a
large
legal
practice
in
virginia
more
because
of
his
industry
and
practicality
than
his
learning
jefferson
thought
more
important
still
he
had
acquired
a
large
landed
estate
along
with
debts
which
were
considerable
but
seemed
to
be
amply
covered
jefferson
and
others
found
him
a
most
agreeable
man
and
he
conducted
his
extensive
affairs
in
a
generous
and
optimistic
spirit
her
mother
had
died
soon
after
martha
was
born
leaving
no
other
children
she
was
of
the
prominent
eppes
family
which
had
been
associated
to
some
degree
with
the
early
jeffersons
and
by
her
marriage
settlement
she
had
assured
her
descendants
of
certain
inherited
lands
and
slaves
there
were
three
other
girls
in
the
family
the
daughters
of
another
of
john
wayles
s
wives
one
of
these
girls
elizabeth
who
played
an
important
part
in
the
family
life
of
jefferson
later
on
may
already
have
married
francis
eppes
first
cousin
of
martha
and
another
was
engaged
john
wayles
had
three
wives
and
lost
all
of
them
the
third
one
was
the
widow
of
reuben
skeleton
martha
had
added
to
the
genealogical
confusion
by
marrying
his
brother
bathurst
that
alliance
had
proved
short
lived
and
by
the
early
months
of
jefferson
wanted
to
offer
her
another
he
found
her
responsive
but
he
was
discouraged
at
first
by
his
failure
to
solve
the
housing
problem
in
june
his
prospect
of
becoming
more
regularly
a
pater
familias
were
much
brighter
and
he
then
made
an
important
change
in
the
order
he
had
previously
given
to
his
merchant
friend
by
that
time
he
had
seen
a
forte
piano
and
he
now
wanted
that
sort
of
instrument
instead
of
a
clavichord
purposing
to
give
this
to
martha
he
desired
the
case
to
be
of
fine
mahogany
solid
not
veneered
and
the
workmanship
very
handsome
also
he
ordered
for
himself
some
stockings
of
the
best
quality
along
with
a
large
umbrella
with
brass
ribs
covered
with
green
silk
and
neatly
finished
he
was
impatient
for
these
articles
particularly
the
piano
and
predicted
rather
humorously
that
his
orders
would
be
somewhat
enlarged
thereafter
it
was
at
this
date
also
that
he
sought
a
builder
to
help
him
at
monticello
things
were
moving
on
the
mountain
but
not
as
fast
as
he
liked
and
he
himself
could
not
be
there
all
the
time
he
may
not
yet
have
set
up
in
his
books
his
account
with
the
estate
of
bathurst
skelton
but
about
this
time
he
opened
another
one
prematurely
this
was
for
john
skelton
son
of
bathurst
with
himself
as
guardian
in
behalf
of
martha
his
wife
he
made
an
entry
on
account
of
the
boy
but
attached
no
figures
he
was
not
to
acquire
a
stepson
after
all
for
john
skelton
died
in
the
summer
before
the
marriage
not
yet
having
reached
the
age
of
four
john
was
only
a
fleeting
memory
to
jefferson
though
possibly
a
poignant
one
since
he
was
exceedingly
fond
of
children
martha
was
a
present
reality
and
a
future
hope
writing
to
his
prospective
brother
in
law
late
that
summer
he
avowed
his
sentiments
for
her
in
language
of
formal
extravagance
which
sounds
artificial
to
the
modern
ear
offer
prayers
for
me
too
at
that
shrine
to
which
tho
absent
i
pray
continual
devotions
in
every
scheme
of
happiness
she
is
placed
in
the
foreground
of
the
picture
as
the
principal
figure
take
that
away
and
it
is
no
picture
for
me
somewhat
later
within
the
wayles
family
circle
he
referred
to
her
as
patty
but
he
closely
guarded
that
intimate
name
the
surviving
descriptions
of
her
are
meager
and
there
is
none
contemporary
with
these
events
in
comparison
with
him
she
certainly
was
not
tall
as
an
old
slave
put
it
she
was
low
the
tradition
is
that
her
figure
was
slight
though
well
formed
that
she
had
large
hazel
eyes
and
luxuriant
auburn
hair
within
the
family
much
was
said
afterwards
about
her
beauty
and
this
can
be
accepted
in
essence
though
not
in
full
detail
jefferson
himself
was
straight
and
strong
and
his
countenance
was
not
unpleasing
but
he
was
not
a
handsome
man
beyond
a
doubt
he
prided
himself
on
winning
a
pretty
wife
there
is
considerable
evidence
of
her
amiability
and
her
sprightliness
of
manner
her
gaiety
of
spirit
offset
the
characteristic
seriousness
of
her
lover
in
her
presence
he
could
unbend
gentle
and
sympathetic
people
always
attracted
him
most
and
clearly
she
was
that
sort
though
she
may
have
had
her
fiery
moments
before
childbearing
wore
her
out
she
was
not
only
a
pretty
lady
but
an
accomplished
one
in
the
customary
ways
and
her
love
for
music
was
a
special
bond
with
him
she
played
on
the
harpsichord
and
the
pianoforte
as
he
did
on
the
violin
and
the
cello
the
tradition
is
that
music
provided
the
accompaniment
for
his
successful
suit
his
rivals
are
said
to
have
departed
in
admitted
defeat
after
hearing
him
play
and
sing
with
her
in
later
years
he
had
the
cheerful
habit
of
singing
and
humming
to
himself
as
he
went
about
his
plantation
this
is
not
proof
in
itself
that
he
was
a
pleasing
vocal
performer
but
with
martha
in
the
parlor
it
was
probably
easier
for
him
to
sing
than
it
ever
was
afterwards
by
this
time
he
had
found
opportunity
to
take
violin
lessons
in
williamsburg
from
francis
alberti
who
had
come
to
the
capital
as
a
player
and
had
remained
as
a
teacher
martha
is
said
to
have
taken
lessons
on
the
harpsichord
from
the
same
man
no
doubt
she
shared
jefferson
s
enthusiasm
when
he
induced
the
italian
to
come
to
monticello
at
some
time
after
the
wedding
and
to
continue
to
give
instruction
there
jefferson
tried
to
get
a
better
violin
for
himself
as
well
as
the
handsome
pianoforte
for
his
future
wife
he
is
said
to
have
carried
with
him
on
his
early
travels
a
kit
or
small
fiddle
on
which
he
played
at
odd
moments
with
a
minimum
of
annoyance
to
his
hosts
and
he
had
purchased
an
instrument
for
five
pounds
in
williamsburg
he
now
had
his
eye
on
the
fine
violin
which
john
randolph
had
imported
and
during
the
spring
that
he
went
most
often
to
the
forest
he
made
an
agreement
with
the
attorney
general
which
george
wythe
and
patrick
henry
witnessed
among
others
he
was
to
get
this
prized
instrument
if
he
survived
his
friend
and
randolph
was
to
get
books
of
his
to
a
high
value
if
things
went
the
other
way
the
bargain
was
somewhat
jocular
and
it
seems
one
sided
unless
jefferson
felt
pretty
confident
that
he
would
be
the
survivor
actually
he
did
get
randolph
s
violin
four
years
later
under
circumstances
which
he
had
no
reason
to
predict
he
was
not
now
thinking
of
revolution
and
his
wishes
were
well
expressed
by
another
may
business
and
play
music
and
the
merriment
of
your
family
lighten
your
hearts
said
his
prospective
brother
in
law
during
the
fall
of
he
had
to
do
something
besides
visit
martha
he
had
to
go
to
court
in
williamsburg
and
to
get
himself
re
elected
to
the
house
of
burgesses
among
other
things
by
this
time
he
had
decided
that
the
legal
business
of
robert
carter
nicholas
was
an
additional
burden
which
he
could
not
assume
his
declination
was
not
wholly
because
of
the
demands
of
his
own
practice
there
were
other
important
matters
to
be
attended
to
on
christmas
eve
he
set
out
with
jupiter
from
monticello
on
his
way
to
be
married
but
he
did
not
arrive
until
after
christmas
day
francis
eppes
signed
the
wedding
bond
with
him
and
he
paid
forty
shillings
for
the
license
on
the
last
day
of
the
old
year
the
wedding
was
on
the
first
day
of
the
new
two
clergymen
were
present
and
there
was
at
least
one
fiddler
the
atmosphere
must
have
been
gay
and
in
due
course
the
servants
were
well
tipped
the
homeward
trip
was
delayed
by
a
stay
of
more
than
two
weeks
at
the
forest
in
whatever
seclusion
the
couple
could
find
in
mid
january
they
set
out
in
a
phaeton
which
had
already
been
mended
at
shirley
and
had
to
be
mended
again
at
tuckahoe
not
until
they
left
the
hospitable
seat
of
the
randolphs
where
the
bridegroom
had
lived
as
a
boy
did
silence
fall
he
then
ceased
keeping
his
accounts
before
the
end
of
the
month
they
were
at
monticello
where
the
ground
was
covered
with
three
feet
of
snow
the
story
is
that
they
arrived
late
at
night
having
left
the
phaeton
at
colonel
carter
s
blenheim
and
proceeded
eight
miles
over
a
mountain
road
on
horseback
only
to
find
that
the
fires
were
out
and
the
servants
were
all
in
bed
martha
s
introduction
to
her
unfinished
home
may
have
been
discouraging
but
she
had
her
husband
s
company
for
a
couple
of
uninterrupted
months
the
house
of
burgesses
met
without
him
in
february
and
he
did
not
go
to
williamsburg
on
legal
business
until
the
mountainside
was
green
the
leaves
had
only
begun
to
turn
in
late
september
when
their
first
child
was
born
an
hour
after
midnight
like
so
many
others
on
both
sides
of
the
family
she
was
named
martha
for
six
months
they
wondered
if
she
would
survive
then
she
was
recovered
almost
instantaneously
by
a
good
breast
of
milk
supplied
by
a
negro
wet
nurse
no
doubt
this
experience
convinced
her
father
who
already
had
little
confidence
in
medicine
as
then
practised
that
it
was
better
to
rely
on
nature
than
doctors
especially
in
the
case
of
infants
after
this
early
fright
it
fortunately
turned
out
that
patsy
as
she
was
called
in
the
family
had
inherited
her
father
s
robust
constitution
as
well
as
his
sanguine
temperament
and
she
was
a
comfort
to
him
to
the
end
of
his
life
not
until
eighteen
months
after
the
birth
of
patsy
was
there
another
baby
meanwhile
the
health
of
the
mother
excited
no
comment
and
presumably
was
satisfactory
during
the
early
part
of
jefferson
s
second
year
as
a
married
man
he
was
often
away
from
home
and
by
the
spring
of
the
political
pot
had
begun
to
simmer
but
these
were
pleasant
months
on
the
mountain
that
is
until
tragic
events
occurred
in
may
the
first
of
these
and
the
more
shocking
was
the
death
of
dabney
carr
who
was
not
yet
thirty
jefferson
s
friend
had
made
marked
progress
at
the
bar
practising
in
the
same
courts
as
patrick
henry
he
had
become
the
most
serious
forensic
rival
of
that
orator
who
had
yet
appeared
he
had
recently
made
an
impressive
debut
in
the
house
of
burgesses
which
jefferson
had
partly
contrived
and
of
which
he
was
always
proud
he
was
more
prosperous
now
than
he
had
been
soon
after
peter
carr
was
born
he
was
in
charlottesville
when
he
died
of
bilious
fever
dr
george
gilmer
who
now
lived
near
by
at
pen
park
and
attended
all
the
jeffersons
was
unable
to
combat
it
the
family
tradition
is
that
the
burial
was
at
shadwell
before
jefferson
could
return
to
albemarle
from
williamsburg
within
a
week
however
he
set
two
men
grubbing
a
graveyard
on
his
mountain
beneath
an
oak
tree
where
he
and
dabney
are
reputed
to
have
read
and
talked
together
and
to
have
agreed
that
they
should
both
lie
someday
soon
he
had
the
remains
of
his
friend
interred
at
this
spot
this
was
not
the
fanciful
burying
ground
which
he
had
conjured
out
of
his
earlier
romantic
melancholy
it
was
a
plot
of
only
eighty
square
feet
but
from
that
time
it
was
a
hallowed
place
he
believed
that
of
all
men
living
he
loved
dabney
carr
the
most
and
he
was
performing
a
deeply
sentimental
act
yet
he
noted
with
cool
precision
how
many
hours
were
required
for
the
grubbing
and
calculated
that
one
laborer
could
do
an
acre
in
four
days
at
that
rate
also
he
recorded
the
fact
that
the
first
peas
had
come
to
the
table
and
calmly
observed
that
it
had
been
a
remarkably
forward
spring
he
was
never
one
to
give
free
expression
to
his
emotions
and
he
was
quite
in
character
in
turning
for
relief
to
figures
to
garden
peas
and
the
weather
to
the
prosaic
affairs
of
every
day
this
strong
strange
man
did
not
wear
his
heart
upon
his
sleeve
his
eagerness
to
perform
friendly
service
was
shown
in
his
efforts
to
provide
for
the
legal
business
of
dabney
carr
he
never
lost
touch
with
the
affairs
of
his
widowed
sister
and
her
six
children
found
in
him
a
second
father
she
stood
beside
him
some
years
later
in
his
own
hour
of
greatest
sorrow
and
by
that
time
her
family
had
joined
his
he
himself
was
then
teaching
little
peter
as
he
would
have
his
own
son
soon
after
the
grubbers
vanished
from
the
graveyard
word
came
of
the
death
of
john
wayles
this
was
less
tragic
for
he
was
a
widower
of
fifty
eight
and
his
children
were
all
grown
or
nearly
so
jefferson
liked
him
and
undoubtedly
mourned
his
loss
but
from
the
practical
point
of
view
there
were
compensations
the
result
was
the
doubling
of
his
own
estate
he
became
involved
in
a
maze
of
financial
transactions
as
one
of
the
executors
along
with
his
brothers
in
law
francis
eppes
and
henry
skip
with
when
he
went
to
the
forest
in
july
and
acquired
from
a
servant
there
at
an
odd
moment
a
couple
of
mockingbirds
he
could
hardly
have
anticipated
how
vexing
and
protracted
these
affairs
would
be
the
immediate
prospect
was
distinctly
favorable
the
division
of
the
property
was
made
in
two
years
after
his
marriage
jefferson
then
acquired
on
behalf
of
martha
more
than
eleven
thousand
acres
of
land
his
father
in
law
had
left
a
heavy
debt
to
an
english
mercantile
firm
however
and
he
promptly
sold
some
six
thousand
acres
in
order
to
meet
his
proportionate
share
of
this
the
net
effect
of
the
inheritance
was
to
add
to
his
own
possessions
poplar
forest
in
bedford
county
and
elk
island
and
elkhill
in
goochland
the
latter
place
played
a
part
in
his
history
through
the
revolution
but
only
poplar
forest
was
permanently
retained
early
in
the
fall
after
john
wayles
died
he
made
his
first
recorded
visit
to
this
favorite
seat
of
his
later
years
there
was
one
difficulty
but
it
seemed
small
at
the
time
he
did
not
get
cash
for
the
lands
he
sold
rarely
could
anybody
get
that
in
virginia
he
received
from
the
purchasers
what
he
called
bonds
and
we
should
call
notes
and
the
english
creditors
of
john
wayles
would
not
accept
these
in
settlement
preferring
jefferson
s
bond
accordingly
though
his
share
of
the
debt
was
covered
it
was
not
paid
as
things
turned
out
he
was
not
able
to
collect
from
his
own
creditors
until
after
the
currency
had
depreciated
and
was
compelled
to
provide
for
his
inherited
debt
all
over
again
in
the
year
however
he
had
no
reason
to
anticipate
this
misfortune
and
he
was
fully
warranted
in
thinking
of
himself
as
a
wealthy
man
so
far
as
his
own
patrimony
was
concerned
his
operations
from
this
date
through
the
revolution
consisted
primarily
in
disposing
of
outlying
lands
and
acquiring
others
nearer
home
outside
of
the
county
he
acquired
by
patent
one
bit
of
property
which
greatly
interested
him
it
contained
natural
bridge
which
he
afterwards
described
as
the
most
sublime
of
the
works
of
nature
in
round
figures
he
had
some
five
thousand
acres
from
his
own
patrimony
concentrated
in
albemarle
and
about
that
many
outside
the
county
from
the
wayles
estate
the
immediate
effect
of
his
wife
s
inheritance
however
was
more
than
the
doubling
of
his
ease
of
circumstances
for
his
slaves
were
increased
at
a
higher
rate
by
this
time
he
had
somewhat
more
than
in
his
own
right
and
he
listed
whom
he
held
on
behalf
of
his
wife
at
monticello
domestic
servants
were
abundant
and
a
number
of
the
favorites
came
into
his
possession
through
her
ursula
the
fat
woman
who
nursed
patsy
and
later
children
and
her
husband
king
george
had
been
acquired
for
mrs
jefferson
while
the
noted
hemings
family
who
were
mostly
bright
mulattoes
came
through
the
wayles
estate
jefferson
was
kind
to
his
servants
to
the
point
of
indulgence
and
within
the
framework
of
an
institution
he
disliked
he
saw
that
they
were
well
provided
for
his
people
were
devoted
to
him
and
they
made
his
home
life
comfortable
and
jolly
now
that
he
had
so
many
slaves
or
as
he
said
servants
and
so
much
land
he
had
to
expand
his
records
in
the
year
he
began
his
farm
book
through
force
of
circumstances
however
his
personal
interest
in
agriculture
was
not
fully
manifested
for
a
score
of
years
public
affairs
had
not
yet
disrupted
his
life
but
he
was
still
a
busy
lawyer
and
he
gave
less
personal
attention
to
his
farms
than
to
his
home
the
plantation
seat
was
the
center
of
life
in
virginia
and
particularly
so
with
him
bricks
were
still
being
molded
and
burned
at
monticello
and
building
was
going
on
by
this
time
he
had
had
at
least
one
of
the
roundabouts
made
four
of
these
ultimately
encircled
the
mountain
being
connected
by
oblique
roads
he
had
kept
on
planting
fruit
trees
and
in
the
spring
of
soon
after
the
peaches
had
come
into
full
bloom
he
laid
out
a
permanent
vegetable
garden
on
the
southeastern
slope
between
the
orchard
and
the
first
roundabout
it
was
to
have
at
each
end
a
rectangular
isosceles
triangle
and
he
gave
specific
measurements
for
the
hypotenuse
and
legs
during
his
wife
s
second
confinement
he
stayed
close
by
diverting
himself
and
making
himself
useful
by
planting
vegetables
in
the
beds
he
put
numbered
sticks
and
in
his
record
he
rendered
homely
names
in
italian
thus
garlic
appeared
as
aglio
di
toscania
but
although
this
variety
came
originally
from
tuscany
it
was
only
garlic
by
any
name
succory
or
wild
endive
was
put
down
as
radicchio
di
pistoia
a
white
onion
was
cipolle
bianche
di
tuckaboe
and
beans
given
him
by
somebody
across
the
mountains
were
fagiuoli
d
augusta
the
italian
names
reflect
the
influence
of
a
new
neighbor
philip
mazzei
was
a
friend
of
his
in
two
revolutions
and
figured
in
a
historic
controversy
relating
to
george
washington
into
which
jefferson
fell
a
score
of
years
after
he
met
the
enthusiastic
florentine
on
the
little
mountain
in
albemarle
their
early
association
provides
the
first
striking
example
of
jefferson
s
penchant
for
international
friendship
and
illustrates
other
ways
of
his
mazzei
was
something
of
a
benvenuto
cellini
in
his
youth
according
to
his
own
report
and
as
such
would
hardly
have
appealed
to
jefferson
but
he
had
come
to
virginia
with
the
useful
purpose
of
planting
vineyards
and
was
under
the
patronage
of
the
very
merchant
thomas
adams
from
whom
jefferson
had
ordered
a
pianoforte
immediately
upon
his
arrival
in
the
province
he
and
his
laborers
had
gone
temporarily
to
the
home
of
francis
eppes
then
with
adams
he
had
set
out
for
the
shenandoah
valley
where
the
latter
had
property
and
hoped
mazzei
would
settle
it
was
unfortunate
for
these
plans
that
they
stopped
for
an
evening
at
monticello
this
was
in
november
early
the
next
morning
mazzei
and
his
host
got
up
before
the
others
thus
revealing
one
of
the
latter
s
habits
jefferson
took
him
for
a
considerable
walk
showed
him
a
tract
of
land
which
he
could
buy
and
offered
to
give
or
more
probably
to
lend
him
some
of
his
own
land
on
their
return
adams
on
looking
at
jefferson
said
i
see
by
your
expression
that
you
ve
taken
him
away
from
me
i
knew
you
would
do
that
the
host
smiled
and
suggested
that
they
have
breakfast
he
was
never
backward
when
given
the
opportunity
to
acquire
and
keep
an
interesting
acquaintance
he
got
mazzei
established
near
by
at
colle
keeping
him
as
a
guest
until
his
house
was
built
soon
a
dozen
italian
workmen
arrived
and
to
their
delight
the
tall
friendly
virginian
who
cultivated
the
linguistic
arts
as
he
did
his
garden
talked
with
them
in
tuscan
which
he
had
picked
up
unaided
thus
did
jefferson
help
introduce
italian
wines
and
vegetables
into
the
red
clay
country
and
with
them
new
varieties
of
spades
and
billhooks
and
a
novel
sort
of
hunting
coat
the
vineyards
though
cultivated
diligently
for
several
years
did
not
prove
permanent
but
some
of
the
vignerons
merged
with
the
population
jefferson
who
had
subscribed
to
the
wine
company
added
to
his
own
cellar
which
had
previously
contained
chiefly
rum
madeira
port
and
small
beer
from
mazzei
he
got
certain
delicacies
of
food
such
as
anchovies
but
he
paid
generously
in
this
as
in
most
of
his
friendships
he
gave
more
than
he
received
an
exception
should
be
made
in
the
matter
of
talk
for
he
finally
admitted
that
mazzei
wore
him
out
other
events
in
his
domestic
life
before
he
entered
more
actively
upon
his
public
career
can
be
described
from
his
account

these
prosaic
entries
mark
the
end
of
one
of
peter
jefferson
s
children
who
had
wandered
both
in
body
and
in
mind
the
details
of
the
sad
story
were
buried
with
the
victim
and
at
monticello
itself
the
balance
was
soon
redressed
at
about
eleven
o
clock
on
the
morning
of
april
martha
wayles
jefferson
gave
birth
to
another
daughter
who
was
named
jane
randolph
for
her
grandmother
at
least
she
survived
long
enough
to
acquire
a
name
she
lived
about
eighteen
months
to
be
exact
the
personal
prosperity
of
her
father
was
now
at
its
height
and
his
domestic
tranquillity
was
relatively
unmarred
until
he
took
the
turn
of
the
road
which
led
straight
to
political
revolution
joys
had
predominated
over
cares
and
sorrows
and
he
was
an
enviably
happy
man
revolting
against
an
empire
xiii
the
growth
of
a
political
mind
for
more
than
two
years
after
his
marriage
jefferson
s
activities
were
largely
personal
and
professional
this
was
not
merely
because
of
domestic
circumstances
and
his
own
inclination
it
was
owing
even
more
to
the
conditions
of
the
times
the
longstanding
but
intermittent
quarrel
with
the
mother
country
did
not
become
acute
until
the
spring
of
when
the
teapot
really
began
to
boil
he
had
not
attained
a
marked
grade
in
politics
by
then
and
he
did
not
become
a
public
character
in
the
full
sense
until
some
months
afterwards
but
he
had
already
identified
himself
with
the
most
aggressive
group
of
the
local
patriots
and
upon
occasion
he
had
been
exceedingly
active
behind
the
scenes
what
was
more
important
he
had
given
much
thought
to
fundamental
political
questions
while
the
imperial
controversialists
appeared
to
be
marking
time
he
absented
himself
from
the
meeting
of
the
house
of
burgesses
just
after
his
marriage
for
personal
reasons
his
colleagues
could
easily
understand
and
after
that
the
governor
saved
the
young
husband
trouble
by
keeping
the
assembly
prorogued
for
another
year
his
excellency
john
murray
earl
of
dunmore
viscount
fincastle
baron
of
blair
of
moulin
and
of
tillymont
undoubtedly
believed
that
he
was
sparing
himself
difficulty
as
well
this
scottish
peer
who
had
come
to
the
governorship
of
the
province
of
virginia
from
that
of
new
york
had
been
received
with
the
honors
befitting
one
who
was
so
many
times
a
lord
but
it
soon
appeared
that
he
was
a
man
of
different
temper
from
his
courtly
predecessor
the
spirited
virginians
did
not
like
his
haughty
airs
jefferson
himself
disliked
arrogance
as
he
did
few
other
qualities
and
dunmore
was
probably
the
first
high
british
official
in
whom
he
observed
it
he
had
no
particular
personal
contacts
with
the
governor
unless
it
was
at
dunmore
s
instance
that
he
drew
plans
for
the
enlargement
of
the
college
of
william
and
mary
and
the
alteration
of
the
palace
but
he
was
on
hand
in
the
spring
of
when
dunmore
ran
into
his
first
serious
political
difficulties
and
he
then
played
a
characteristically
patriotic
part
the
governor
would
have
preferred
to
get
along
without
the
assembly
but
he
had
to
call
it
because
of
forgeries
of
paper
currency
which
the
treasurer
had
detected
the
burgesses
including
jefferson
attended
to
this
special
business
when
they
met
in
the
month
of
march
while
complimenting
the
governor
on
his
energy
in
bringing
the
counterfeiters
to
justice
however
they
rebuked
him
politely
for
the
summary
methods
he
had
used
his
excellency
replied
to
them
tartly
and
he
wrote
to
his
superior
in
england
they
seem
at
least
obliquely
in
some
degree
to
censure
my
conduct
there
did
not
really
seem
to
be
much
doubt
about
it
he
also
said
there
are
some
resolves
which
show
a
little
ill
humour
in
the
house
of
burgesses
but
i
thought
them
so
insignificant
that
i
took
no
notice
of
them
he
showed
thereby
either
a
deplorable
lack
of
foresight
or
an
unusual
spirit
of
restraint
these
resolves
created
a
standing
committee
of
correspondence
and
constituted
one
of
the
more
fateful
acts
in
the
preliminaries
of
the
revolution
the
governor
could
still
prorogue
the
assembly
but
such
action
on
his
part
was
now
rendered
relatively
ineffectual
for
the
committee
could
continue
to
meet
there
had
been
an
incident
in
rhode
island
where
a
revenue
vessel
called
the
gaspee
had
been
burned
and
the
question
of
sending
offenders
to
england
for
trial
had
come
up
again
along
with
patrick
henry
richard
henry
lee
francis
lightfoot
lee
dabney
carr
and
possibly
some
others
jefferson
had
concluded
that
the
old
and
leading
members
lacked
the
zeal
which
the
times
required
accordingly
this
little
group
met
privately
in
the
evenings
at
the
raleigh
tavern
for
consultation
they
were
all
convinced
he
said
that
the
greatest
need
was
for
unity
of
colonial
action
this
could
hardly
have
been
attained
during
the
next
few
years
without
the
committees
of
correspondence
there
had
previously
been
local
committees
in
massachusetts
but
jefferson
himself
never
had
any
doubt
that
the
one
in
virginia
was
the
first
that
was
set
up
to
represent
a
colony
as
a
whole
he
never
claimed
that
the
original
idea
was
his
and
credit
for
it
seems
to
belong
to
richard
henry
lee
he
did
say
that
his
group
drafted
the
resolutions
that
he
was
asked
to
introduce
them
and
that
he
gained
that
privilege
for
dabney
carr
who
thus
made
his
political
debut
in
connection
with
an
important
action
both
of
them
attended
the
first
meeting
of
the
committee
of
eleven
but
neither
was
appointed
to
the
select
committee
of
three
which
was
distinctly
more
conservative
in
temper
nonetheless
he
and
his
brother
in
law
helped
create
an
agency
which
was
designed
to
tie
the
colonial
patriots
together
and
which
undoubtedly
served
to
promote
the
revolt
against
the
empire
but
the
time
for
open
revolt
was
still
not
ripe
and
dunmore
continued
to
save
him
trouble
by
proroguing
the
assembly
it
did
not
meet
again
until
may
and
it
was
in
this
interim
of
a
year
that
dabney
carr
and
john
wayles
died
that
he
had
to
take
care
of
his
wife
s
large
inheritance
that
he
induced
philip
mazzei
and
his
vignerons
to
settle
near
monticello
not
until
after
the
birth
of
his
second
daughter
did
he
have
much
freedom
or
occasion
to
engage
in
important
public
business
there
had
been
grave
developments
in
the
sphere
of
imperial
relations
in
the
meantime
dun
more
was
probably
wise
from
his
restricted
point
of
view
in
putting
off
the
assembly
as
long
as
he
could
but
his
timing
proved
to
be
bad
for
news
of
fresh
woes
in
boston
reached
williamsburg
during
the
session
the
british
officials
had
blundered
into
a
major
crisis
they
had
caused
the
hated
tea
tax
to
become
a
highly
visible
reality
and
had
united
colonial
opposition
by
permitting
the
east
india
company
to
import
tea
direct
to
the
injury
of
american
merchants
the
cargoes
of
some
of
the
ships
had
met
a
spectacular
fate
in
boston
and
the
virginians
now
learned
that
parliament
had
passed
the
port
act
according
to
jefferson
this
involved
the
utter
ruin
of
a
prosperous
commercial
city
the
tinder
had
been
laid
for
some
time
and
a
spark
had
now
ignited
it
the
question
was
whether
the
fire
would
rage
only
in
the
vicinity
of
boston
or
would
sweep
down
the
seaboard
he
was
one
of
those
who
helped
it
spread
a
neighbor
of
george
washington
s
whose
mind
was
more
like
thomas
jefferson
s
was
in
williamsburg
on
private
business
during
that
fateful
month
of
may
george
mason
commented
informally
on
the
situation
saying
much
in
praise
of
patrick
henry
whatever
resolves
or
measures
are
intended
for
the
preservation
of
our
rights
and
liberties
will
be
reserved
for
the
conclusion
of
the
session
he
predicted
matters
of
that
sort
here
are
conducted
and
prepared
with
a
great
deal
of
privacy
and
by
very
few
members
of
whom
patrick
henry
is
the
principal
at
the
request
of
the
gentlemen
concerned
i
have
spent
an
evening
with
them
upon
the
subject
jefferson
was
probably
one
of
these
very
few
members
and
he
certainly
belonged
to
a
little
group
who
were
now
plotting
privately
about
means
of
taking
an
unequivocal
stand
in
the
line
with
massachusetts
he
and
his
fellows
had
cooked
up
something
by
the
time
that
mason
wrote
he
himself
has
been
given
the
major
credit
for
the
idea
of
a
general
day
of
fasting
and
prayer
to
signalize
the
closing
of
the
port
of
boston
and
as
the
most
scholarly
member
of
the
party
he
probably
did
most
of
the
rummaging
for
precedents
and
puritan
forms
he
did
not
introduce
the
pious
resolutions
however
he
and
the
others
wisely
induced
robert
carter
nicholas
whose
character
was
more
grave
and
religious
to
do
that
nobody
in
the
house
of
burgesses
dissented
lord
dunmore
did
not
stop
with
the
prorogation
of
the
assembly
this
time
he
dissolved
it
he
claimed
that
this
paper
reflected
highly
upon
the
king
and
parliament
but
the
most
significant
of
its
phrases
was
the
one
that
spoke
of
our
sister
colony
of
massachusetts
bay
jefferson
was
among
the
great
body
of
burgesses
who
proceeded
to
the
raleigh
tavern
and
signed
another
association
and
he
soon
attended
a
meeting
of
the
committee
of
correspondence
which
ordered
that
letters
be
sent
to
similar
committees
elsewhere
about
the
calling
of
a
general
congress
if
he
did
not
march
to
bruton
church
with
other
former
burgesses
on
june
in
solemn
defiance
of
lord
dunmore
it
was
only
because
he
was
not
in
town
and
he
and
john
walker
called
for
a
patriotic
service
of
prayer
in
his
parish
in
albemarle
without
bothering
to
consult
the
governor
the
purpose
of
this
as
proclaimed
in
words
which
he
no
doubt
wrote
was
devoutly
to
implore
the
divine
interposition
in
behalf
of
an
injured
and
oppressed
people
the
people
met
generally
throughout
the
province
he
said
with
anxiety
and
alarm
in
their
faces
and
the
effect
was
like
a
shock
of
electricity
arousing
every
man
and
placing
him
erect
and
solidly
on
his
centre
he
had
helped
translate
the
local
grievance
of
boston
into
a
common
cause
and
unquestionably
he
himself
was
among
the
first
to
be
electrified
his
distinguished
contemporary
john
adams
writing
to
him
long
afterwards
said
that
the
real
revolution
in
america
was
in
the
minds
of
the
people
and
was
effected
between
and
before
a
drop
of
blood
was
shed
at
lexington
the
observation
can
be
readily
applied
to
jefferson
with
only
minor
changes
in
words
and
dates
he
had
strongly
armed
his
mind
before
critical
events
occurred
and
was
more
than
ready
for
them
when
they
came
he
never
did
set
forth
his
political
philosophy
in
full
and
systematic
form
but
he
gave
valuable
clues
to
its
development
he
went
through
an
evolutionary
rather
than
a
revolutionary
process
and
with
him
thought
long
preceded
action
and
determined
its
direction
in
advance
his
early
study
had
not
been
concentrated
on
problems
of
government
it
was
naturally
centered
on
the
law
until
he
was
admitted
to
the
bar
and
it
probably
continued
to
be
for
a
good
many
months
after
that
but
he
left
place
in
his
rigorous
schedule
of
reading
for
what
he
called
politics
and
he
laid
great
emphasis
on
the
history
of
legal
doctrines
and
institutions
by
no
means
the
least
of
his
services
to
his
own
commonwealth
during
the
revolution
were
in
the
technical
field
of
law
and
these
were
made
possible
only
by
the
knowledge
which
he
had
laboriously
acquired
as
a
student
and
a
practitioner
and
to
which
he
made
additions
after
he
ceased
attending
court
the
step
from
the
study
of
law
to
that
of
government
was
so
short
that
he
could
easily
have
taken
it
without
any
special
deliberation
it
would
have
been
strange
indeed
if
he
had
not
given
some
thought
to
political
theory
and
done
some
reading
on
the
subject
while
he
was
inquiring
so
diligently
into
legal
origins
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
however
that
his
interest
in
general
political
questions
was
stimulated
by
his
entrance
into
the
house
of
burgesses
when
he
assumed
his
traditional
responsibilities
as
a
public
man
and
unquestionably
it
was
accentuated
thereafter
by
his
growing
awareness
of
the
fundamental
problems
which
must
be
solved
throughout
life
he
was
deeply
interested
in
the
application
of
knowledge
to
human
affairs
and
with
him
human
affairs
came
to
include
a
great
deal
of
government
in
old
age
he
spoke
of
the
enormities
of
the
times
in
which
he
had
happened
to
live
and
lamented
that
they
had
deflected
him
from
the
delightful
pursuit
of
knowledge
they
did
not
really
deflect
him
for
he
continued
to
study
assiduously
and
to
deal
in
applied
scholarship
throughout
his
long
generation
in
public
life
the
real
effect
of
circumstance
was
to
direct
his
reading
and
thinking
into
political
channels
to
a
greater
degree
than
he
had
expected
and
thus
to
restrict
somewhat
the
scope
of
his
intellectual
activities
though
most
people
would
regard
these
as
quite
broad
enough
the
dates
of
the
various
entries
in
his
notebooks
cannot
be
determined
with
entire
confidence
and
even
if
they
could
be
the
works
that
he
cited
cannot
be
assumed
to
have
been
the
source
of
his
ideas
these
ideas
he
shared
to
greater
or
less
degree
with
his
contemporaries
and
he
could
have
plucked
many
of
them
from
the
air
in
numerous
instances
the
printed
page
served
him
chiefly
by
providing
confirmation
or
clarification
of
beliefs
and
opinions
that
he
already
held
beyond
any
question
however
he
prepared
himself
with
extraordinary
care
to
meet
the
issues
of
his
time
he
gave
a
positive
answer
to
the
challenge
of
one
of
the
ancient
writers
whom
he
had
made
a
companion
of
in
his
youth
for
with
slight
efforts
how
should
one
obtain
great
results
it
is
foolish
even
to
desire
it
it
is
a
more
important
fact
that
he
read
widely
and
stored
his
mind
with
riches
than
that
he
abstracted
particular
writings
more
important
still
was
the
spirit
of
fearless
inquiry
in
which
he
pursued
knowledge
years
after
he
made
his
extracts
from
the
history
of
the
common
law
he
described
them
in
words
which
can
be
applied
just
as
well
to
his
notes
on
the
subject
of
government
they
were
written
at
a
time
of
life
when
i
was
bold
in
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
never
fearing
to
follow
truth
and
reason
to
whatever
results
they
led
and
bearding
every
authority
which
stood
in
their
way
before
he
seriously
thought
of
independence
from
great
britain
he
himself
had
attained
full
intellectual
freedom
and
had
let
his
mind
take
him
where
it
would
regardless
of
authority
there
were
however
two
significant
exceptions
he
found
moral
sanctions
in
the
monitor
within
every
human
breast
and
he
found
them
in
the
laws
of
nature
in
each
case
he
was
performing
an
act
of
faith
but
the
results
were
by
no
means
unfavorable
to
the
cause
of
liberty
before
the
imperial
crisis
became
acute
in
and
he
first
had
occasion
to
present
his
political
ideas
in
an
important
way
the
doctrine
of
natural
rights
was
one
of
his
postulates
just
where
he
got
it
is
a
fascinating
question
but
one
to
which
it
seems
impossible
to
give
a
specific
answer
if
he
did
not
draw
on
john
locke
in
the
first
place
but
got
the
ideas
of
that
noted
writer
secondhand
he
certainly
had
his
very
phraseology
by
heart
in
the
simplest
explanation
of
his
failure
to
copy
much
from
locke
in
his
student
notebooks
is
that
he
was
familiar
with
his
most
important
ideas
already
for
the
same
reason
probably
he
did
not
bother
to
copy
extracts
about
natural
rights
from
the
writings
of
other
prominent
exponents
of
the
theory
having
accepted
the
doctrine
as
a
disciple
of
the
enlightenment
he
took
it
for
granted
ever
thereafter
just
as
he
did
the
freedom
of
the
mind
like
so
many
of
his
enlightened
contemporaries
jefferson
believed
that
men
had
originally
been
in
a
state
of
nature
that
they
had
then
been
free
to
order
their
own
actions
and
to
dispose
of
their
own
persons
and
property
as
they
saw
fit
that
government
was
instituted
among
them
in
the
first
place
by
consent
in
the
declaration
of
independence
he
summarized
the
current
doctrine
in
its
classic
american
form
two
years
before
that
describing
colonial
grievances
and
ostensibly
addressing
the
king
he
spoke
with
that
freedom
of
language
and
sentiment
which
becomes
a
free
people
claiming
their
rights
as
derived
from
the
laws
of
nature
and
not
as
the
gift
of
their
chief
magistrate
even
as
early
as
he
had
said
publicly
that
under
the
law
of
nature
all
men
are
born
free
jefferson
said
relatively
little
at
any
time
about
the
social
contract
which
was
supposed
to
have
preceded
the
formation
of
society
when
he
referred
to
contracts
or
compacts
he
generally
meant
charters
constitutions
or
other
formal
agreements
of
the
historical
sort
even
if
the
hypothetical
prehistoric
contract
had
been
successfully
challenged
in
his
day
as
it
was
afterwards
it
is
practically
inconceivable
that
he
would
have
surrendered
his
conviction
that
men
were
born
to
freedom
and
not
to
slavery
for
with
him
this
was
a
profound
moral
conviction
he
did
not
use
his
terms
with
the
precision
of
an
academic
philosopher
and
in
papers
directed
to
particular
occasions
he
did
not
bother
to
define
them
but
in
the
early
stage
of
his
political
career
he
employed
the
term
right
primarily
in
a
moral
sense
he
was
confident
that
force
could
not
give
it
and
that
it
could
derive
from
no
king
he
found
its
source
in
the
universal
law
of
nature
it
arose
from
the
nature
of
things
the
god
who
gave
us
life
gave
us
liberty
at
the
same
time
he
said
nothing
less
could
have
been
expected
of
god
for
liberty
was
right
just
as
force
was
wrong
he
was
far
from
being
a
cynic
he
never
ceased
to
believe
that
good
not
evil
lay
at
the
heart
of
the
universe
and
it
was
this
faith
that
kept
him
from
being
a
mere
intellectual
and
gave
him
his
rare
quality
of
spiritual
leadership
he
clearly
recognized
the
radical
implications
of
the
doctrine
of
natural
rights
when
he
applied
it
in
prematurely
to
the
institution
of
slavery
accepting
the
doctrine
as
wholeheartedly
as
he
did
he
could
not
have
failed
to
judge
other
time
honored
but
unjust
institutions
by
its
universal
standard
besides
being
an
honest
thinker
however
he
was
practical
and
during
the
years
that
he
was
formulating
his
own
ideal
he
considered
the
characteristics
and
merits
of
various
forms
of
government
this
he
did
presumably
when
reading
montesquieu
s
esprit
des
lois
at
a
later
time
he
turned
against
this
noted
writer
especially
because
of
his
predilection
for
things
british
and
his
assertion
that
a
republic
could
be
effective
only
if
its
territory
was
small
before
he
himself
revolted
against
the
british
monarchy
however
he
had
copied
into
his
notebook
in
the
french
numerous
quotations
from
montesquieu
with
summaries
and
reflections
of
his
own
thus
he
commented
he
montesquieu
considers
political
virtue
or
the
amor
patriae
as
the
energetic
principle
of
a
democratic
republic
moderation
that
of
an
aristocratic
republic
honor
that
of
a
limited
monarchy
and
fear
that
of
a
despotism
and
shews
that
every
government
should
provide
that
it
s
energetic
principle
should
be
the
object
of
the
education
of
it
s
youth
that
it
s
laws
also
should
be
relative
to
the
same
principle
in
a
democracy
equality
and
frugality
should
be
promoted
by
the
laws
as
they
nurse
the
amor
patriae
the
order
in
which
these
four
forms
of
government
were
listed
democratic
republic
aristocratic
republic
limited
monarchy
and
despotisms
precisely
that
of
his
own
preference
in
the
ripeness
of
his
political
maturity
but
the
only
one
of
them
which
we
can
be
absolutely
sure
that
he
strongly
opposed
before
the
imperial
crisis
became
acute
was
the
last
from
the
moment
that
he
embraced
the
cause
of
intellectual
liberty
and
human
progress
it
had
been
utterly
impossible
for
him
to
favor
a
despotism
from
his
early
manhood
the
beacon
by
which
he
steered
his
bark
was
hope
not
fear
on
the
other
hand
if
he
had
regarded
the
existing
english
government
as
really
a
limited
monarchy
in
which
honor
ruled
he
probably
could
have
lived
under
it
happily
for
a
good
many
years
it
was
in
that
he
made
a
direct
though
wholly
unsuccessful
appeal
to
the
king
not
until
two
years
had
passed
and
blood
had
actually
been
shed
did
he
become
an
avowed
republican
within
that
brief
period
however
his
mind
became
fully
prepared
not
only
for
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
but
also
for
the
republic
of
federated
states
he
went
to
the
pains
of
surveying
with
scholarly
thoroughness
the
history
of
the
various
federative
systems
of
europe
which
might
serve
as
models
for
the
american
experiment
in
the
light
of
the
thinking
he
had
already
done
the
avowal
of
republicanism
which
he
made
in
at
the
age
of
thirty
three
might
easily
have
been
anticipated
but
there
is
a
real
question
about
his
early
attitude
toward
aristocracy
and
democracy
for
he
did
not
immediately
challenge
and
he
never
wholly
repudiated
the
tradition
in
which
he
himself
had
been
bred
the
society
of
virginia
was
threatened
with
loss
of
fluidity
now
that
the
british
policy
had
restricted
its
westward
movement
but
it
was
still
characterized
by
a
high
sense
of
honor
and
a
general
spirit
of
moderation
as
montesquieu
had
said
that
a
limited
monarchy
and
an
aristocratic
republic
ought
to
be
jefferson
himself
was
not
only
a
fine
gentleman
whose
fortunes
had
improved
he
was
also
a
recognized
member
of
a
ruling
group
which
ruled
well
on
the
whole
he
afterwards
spoke
of
the
ciphers
of
the
aristocracy
and
undoubtedly
there
were
such
but
the
contemporary
record
shows
that
he
admired
peyton
randolph
and
edmund
pendleton
as
he
afterwards
did
george
washington
and
that
he
greatly
valued
the
services
which
such
intelligent
and
responsible
leaders
performed
it
would
have
been
surprising
if
he
had
wanted
to
substitute
for
leadership
of
this
sort
the
rule
of
the
uneducated
crowd
about
whom
so
many
grave
doubts
had
been
expressed
by
the
ancient
writers
the
fact
is
that
never
in
his
life
did
he
believe
it
necessary
to
choose
between
such
alternatives
by
the
time
of
the
declaration
of
independence
he
was
convinced
that
aristocracies
of
birth
and
wealth
were
artificial
and
unjust
but
what
he
sought
to
liberate
and
promote
was
a
natural
aristocracy
of
talent
and
virtue
he
himself
first
appeared
in
the
forum
as
one
who
had
inherited
a
noble
tradition
of
responsibility
along
with
great
privileges
it
is
exceedingly
doubtful
that
he
harbored
any
dreams
of
popular
leadership
at
the
outset
but
there
is
abundant
evidence
that
he
was
motivated
from
the
first
by
the
spirit
of
noblesse
oblige
the
following
quotation
which
he
copied
from
euripides
reflects
the
mood
of
his
student
days
rather
than
that
of
his
maturity
but
this
sort
of
pride
lingered
in
him
for
many
years
to
be
of
the
noble
born
gives
a
peculiar
distinction
clearly
marked
among
men
and
the
noble
name
increases
in
lustre
in
those
who
are
worthy
his
interest
in
a
coat
of
arms
had
been
expressed
somewhat
humorously
but
he
was
fully
aware
of
his
own
superior
status
and
his
first
concern
was
to
prove
himself
worthy
of
his
privileges
afterwards
the
lamp
by
which
he
guided
his
feet
was
that
of
a
reasoned
and
humane
philosophy
as
a
reasoning
human
being
he
weighed
the
merits
of
a
democratic
republic
he
had
read
in
montesquieu
that
the
right
of
suffrage
is
fundamental
in
such
a
government
because
as
he
himself
observed
the
people
exercise
their
sovereignty
by
their
votes
the
idea
of
popular
sovereignty
probably
seemed
to
him
a
reasonable
one
when
it
first
dawned
upon
him
much
more
reasonable
certainly
than
the
divine
right
of
kings
not
until
however
did
he
make
any
serious
effort
to
extend
the
suffrage
and
in
practice
his
advocacy
of
a
more
democratic
government
was
always
conditioned
by
circumstances
this
is
another
way
of
saying
that
his
working
philosophy
was
by
no
means
devoid
of
common
sense
in
the
year
his
later
actions
could
not
have
been
predicted
in
detail
but
there
could
be
no
possible
doubt
of
the
temper
of
his
mind
or
of
the
trend
which
his
thought
had
taken
he
was
essentially
of
the
intellectual
type
veering
toward
the
utilitarian
he
formed
his
maturing
convictions
in
the
light
of
the
fullest
information
that
he
could
obtain
and
while
freeing
himself
from
the
tyranny
of
ancient
dogma
he
had
revealed
himself
also
as
a
man
of
faith
he
embraced
natural
law
while
denying
revelation
and
he
recognized
in
human
reason
and
in
the
moral
sense
of
the
individual
an
authority
which
he
would
not
grant
to
priests
and
kings
his
chief
concern
was
for
the
attainment
and
maintenance
of
liberty
and
this
provides
the
best
single
clue
not
only
to
his
motives
in
the
revolution
but
also
to
his
entire
career
it
was
not
yet
inevitable
that
he
should
revolt
against
the
empire
but
it
was
little
short
of
certain
that
he
would
be
content
with
no
external
control
which
was
more
than
nominal
also
it
could
have
been
confidently
predicted
that
he
would
assess
local
political
institutions
in
the
light
of
reason
and
when
the
opportunity
came
would
try
to
improve
them
he
regarded
tyranny
as
wrong
in
theory
and
generally
stupid
in
practice
there
was
no
question
in
his
mind
that
self
government
was
right
in
theory
and
that
in
practice
it
was
more
likely
than
despotism
to
be
intelligent
being
a
believer
in
the
educability
of
mankind
he
might
have
been
expected
to
favor
the
gradual
but
steady
extension
of
self
government
his
immediate
concern
however
was
to
preserve
it
in
the
degree
that
it
already
existed
in
the
american
colonies
xiv
championing
colonial
rights
jefferson
s
chief
literary
contribution
to
the
patriotic
cause
before
the
declaration
of
independence
was
made
in
the
summer
of
somewhat
by
accident
and
under
circumstances
that
were
disappointing
to
him
at
the
time
for
quite
different
reasons
the
situation
was
discouraging
to
lord
dun
more
having
dissolved
one
assembly
because
of
the
solemn
mischief
which
jefferson
and
his
little
group
of
zealots
had
started
the
governor
hopefully
ordered
the
election
of
another
one
he
soon
learned
however
that
he
was
going
to
be
confronted
with
the
same
determined
faces
and
hastened
to
prorogue
the
new
body
before
all
the
returns
were
in
he
did
not
permit
the
assembly
to
convene
actually
until
nearly
a
year
had
passed
there
was
another
meeting
which
he
could
not
stop
a
convention
which
was
called
for
august
in
williamsburg
and
consisted
of
the
self
same
burgesses
he
had
no
troops
wherewith
to
disperse
these
resourceful
gentlemen
they
were
unable
to
assemble
officially
with
his
consent
but
were
quite
able
to
do
so
unofficially
without
it
that
is
most
of
them
were
but
unluckily
jefferson
could
not
get
there
the
freeholders
of
albemarle
meeting
in
charlottesville
toward
the
end
of
july
conformed
with
the
general
pattern
of
procedure
they
left
their
delegation
exactly
as
it
had
been
before
by
re
electing
jefferson
and
john
walker
as
their
representatives
also
they
adopted
resolutions
which
the
former
had
drawn
he
elaborated
these
ideas
expecting
to
present
them
to
the
convention
but
after
he
had
set
out
for
williamsburg
he
was
stricken
with
dysentery
on
the
hot
road
and
forced
to
turn
back
besides
being
unheroic
in
itself
this
necessary
retreat
occurred
at
a
most
unfortunate
time
for
the
crisis
had
incited
him
to
put
his
thoughts
in
order
and
had
emboldened
him
to
essay
a
more
conspicuous
public
role
perhaps
he
would
not
have
moved
any
faster
toward
a
position
of
commanding
leadership
if
he
had
continued
his
journey
to
the
provincial
capital
he
might
have
received
more
votes
for
delegate
to
the
general
congress
in
philadelphia
if
he
had
been
present
at
the
convention
but
the
seven
who
were
actually
chosen
would
probably
have
been
elected
in
any
case
all
the
members
of
the
delegation
which
was
headed
inevitably
by
peyton
randolph
were
jefferson
s
seniors
in
public
life
and
better
known
than
he
and
they
were
generally
regarded
as
glowing
patriots
george
washington
stood
third
on
the
list
and
patrick
henry
was
fourth
later
in
virginia
jefferson
was
described
as
the
penman
of
the
revolution
as
washington
was
its
sword
and
henry
its
tongue
but
no
one
of
the
three
was
pre
eminent
as
yet
and
jefferson
least
of
all
he
foreshadowed
his
fame
however
by
now
appearing
not
as
a
soldier
or
speaker
but
as
a
writer
he
had
presented
his
ideas
in
the
form
of
resolutions
which
were
to
be
moved
as
instructions
to
the
virginia
delegates
to
congress
and
then
be
embodied
by
congress
he
hoped
in
an
address
to
the
king
unable
to
be
the
bearer
of
his
own
paper
he
sent
it
on
in
two
copies
one
of
these
he
addressed
to
peyton
randolph
whom
he
expected
to
preside
and
the
other
to
patrick
henry
he
never
knew
what
happened
to
henry
s
copy
probably
that
careless
orator
mislaid
it
somewhere
the
other
one
was
laid
on
the
table
for
inspection
and
was
read
in
the
presence
of
a
large
number
at
randolph
s
house
where
it
was
applauded
though
not
wholly
approved
it
was
never
acted
on
officially
but
without
his
knowledge
it
was
printed
in
williamsburg
as
a
summary
view
of
the
rights
of
british
america
he
did
not
supply
the
title
and
did
not
appear
by
name
before
the
year
was
out
it
was
reprinted
in
philadelphia
and
appeared
twice
in
england
this
accidental
pamphlet
of
twenty
three
pages
gained
wider
currency
than
any
other
writing
of
his
that
was
published
during
the
revolution
except
the
declaration
and
it
clearly
anticipated
that
more
famous
and
more
polished
document
it
contributed
to
his
contemporary
reputation
and
until
this
day
it
has
commanded
the
deeply
respectful
attention
of
historians
jefferson
had
not
had
time
to
perfect
his
paper
and
realized
that
there
were
inaccuracies
in
it
the
pamphlet
reveals
very
considerable
learning
and
contains
glowing
sentences
but
it
is
more
noteworthy
for
boldness
and
fervor
than
for
historical
precision
or
literary
grace
written
in
the
white
heat
of
indignation
against
the
coercive
acts
of
the
british
government
the
summary
view
has
a
distinct
place
in
the
controversial
literature
of
the
period
but
it
was
more
than
a
tract
for
the
times
it
embodied
a
reasoned
theory
of
imperial
relations
which
actually
was
better
adapted
to
a
later
era
as
a
contemporary
indictment
of
british
policy
it
bordered
on
recklessness
but
it
was
distinctive
in
its
emphasis
on
philosophical
fundamentals
and
its
prophetic
quality
when
the
circumstances
of
its
writing
are
remembered
a
range
of
inquiry
not
then
very
frequent
and
marching
far
beyond
the
politics
of
the
day
will
surely
be
granted
it
as
edmund
randolph
said
the
intemperance
of
jefferson
s
language
would
have
made
his
resolutions
unacceptable
as
the
official
statement
of
a
responsible
group
desiring
to
accommodate
a
dispute
and
he
himself
recognized
that
his
paper
was
too
strong
for
the
virginia
convention
he
was
modest
about
it
after
his
passions
had
cooled
when
twice
as
old
as
when
he
wrote
it
he
said
if
it
had
any
merit
it
was
that
of
first
taking
our
true
ground
and
that
which
was
afterwards
assumed
and
maintained
one
thing
he
meant
by
the
expression
true
ground
was
the
complete
denial
of
the
authority
of
parliament
over
the
colonies
inseparable
from
his
position
was
a
theory
of
imperial
organization
which
he
afterwards
claimed
that
he
had
held
from
the
beginning
of
the
controversy
this
was
that
the
relation
between
the
colonies
and
the
mother
country
was
the
same
as
that
between
scotland
and
england
from
the
accession
of
james
i
to
the
act
of
union
and
between
hanover
and
england
in
his
own
time
having
the
same
executive
chief
but
no
other
necessary
political
connection
in
virginia
up
to
august
nobody
but
george
wythe
had
agreed
with
him
in
these
matters
as
he
remembered
edmund
randolph
also
relying
on
memory
afterwards
said
that
the
principle
of
bowing
to
external
taxation
by
parliament
as
resulting
from
our
migration
and
a
necessary
dependence
on
the
mother
country
was
generally
conceded
in
virginia
until
jefferson
shook
it
but
ideas
like
his
had
occurred
to
some
other
american
minds
the
logic
of
the
situation
was
quite
clear
to
benjamin
franklin
for
one
before
jefferson
had
even
entered
the
house
of
burgesses
as
early
as
that
sage
observer
had
concluded
that
in
logic
there
was
really
no
middle
ground
between
the
power
of
parliament
to
make
all
laws
for
the
colonies
and
that
of
making
none
and
he
had
drawn
an
analogy
between
the
colonies
and
scotland
that
was
practically
identical
with
the
one
jefferson
afterwards
employed
in
earlier
stages
of
the
growing
controversy
colonial
opposition
had
unquestionably
been
directed
against
particular
measures
which
could
be
termed
unconstitutional
but
the
readiness
of
certain
americans
to
take
the
next
step
and
repudiate
parliament
altogether
while
avowing
loyalty
to
the
king
had
been
observed
by
lord
north
four
years
before
jefferson
put
himself
definitely
on
record
jefferson
s
concept
was
essentially
that
of
imperial
partnership
or
a
commonwealth
of
nations
and
he
was
one
of
the
americans
who
anticipated
the
british
empire
of
self
governing
states
even
if
he
was
not
the
only
one
undoubtedly
he
put
himself
in
the
vanguard
of
the
patriots
in
virginia
and
in
the
colonies
as
a
whole
by
publicly
advocating
the
repudiation
of
parliament
at
this
juncture
events
were
moving
rapidly
and
ideas
were
crystallizing
with
them
but
not
even
at
the
continental
congress
which
met
in
the
early
fall
was
it
possible
to
go
as
far
as
he
desired
congress
then
claimed
for
the
provincial
assemblies
the
exclusive
power
of
legislation
in
all
matters
of
taxation
and
internal
policy
subject
only
to
the
negative
of
the
king
but
they
cheerfully
consented
to
the
operation
of
parliamentary
acts
that
were
limited
to
the
regulation
of
external
commerce
throughout
his
paper
jefferson
s
emphasis
was
on
what
parliament
could
not
do
he
minimized
necessary
concessions
and
practical
limitations
and
proclaimed
colonial
rights
in
a
sweeping
and
dogmatic
way
the
young
ascended
with
mr
jefferson
to
the
source
of
those
rights
said
a
later
commentator
the
old
required
time
for
consideration
before
they
could
tread
this
lofty
ground
which
if
it
had
not
been
abandoned
at
least
had
not
been
fully
occupied
throughout
america
at
the
moment
it
did
not
seem
the
part
of
political
wisdom
to
assume
such
a
lofty
position
and
jefferson
would
have
been
lonely
in
it
if
the
controversy
with
the
mother
country
had
been
soon
resolved
by
attempting
to
ascend
to
the
source
of
authority
in
a
time
of
crisis
he
laid
himself
open
to
the
charge
of
being
an
impractical
theorist
nevertheless
he
located
ultimate
authority
in
precisely
the
same
place
that
he
did
two
years
later
when
he
was
drafting
a
much
more
important
document
fortunately
for
him
general
opinion
had
caught
up
with
him
by
then
or
to
be
more
precise
the
uncompromising
patriots
were
then
in
control
of
congress
and
they
were
ready
to
square
action
with
theory
jefferson
gave
no
general
statement
of
the
doctrine
of
natural
rights
in
his
summary
view
but
he
based
his
whole
argument
on
it
even
on
practical
grounds
he
might
have
come
to
the
same
conclusion
about
parliament
he
might
have
contented
himself
with
saying
that
the
british
americans
had
once
been
essentially
self
governing
and
that
because
of
their
present
stature
and
circumstances
they
ought
to
be
but
he
grounded
his
argument
on
the
nature
of
things
they
were
in
the
beginning
and
evermore
should
be
his
presuppositions
may
be
questioned
and
there
were
flaws
in
his
historical
presentation
but
morally
his
case
was
strong
he
took
the
position
that
originally
in
england
the
ancestors
of
these
british
americans
had
been
free
just
as
their
more
remote
saxon
forefathers
had
been
in
their
native
wilds
and
that
they
had
a
natural
right
to
emigrate
and
establish
laws
and
regulations
of
their
own
just
as
the
saxons
did
his
cousin
richard
bland
had
said
much
the
same
thing
a
decade
earlier
in
his
own
studies
however
jefferson
had
given
particular
attention
to
the
saxons
especially
in
connection
with
land
tenure
and
he
believed
that
they
exemplified
english
liberty
in
its
purest
form
the
important
consideration
is
not
that
he
idealized
them
though
he
did
it
is
that
his
mind
craved
historical
as
well
as
philosophical
authority
and
that
he
could
not
be
content
without
finding
precedent
somewhere
for
the
freedom
he
was
so
sure
was
right
he
also
followed
bland
in
asserting
dogmatically
that
the
conquest
and
settlement
of
the
american
wilds
had
been
made
wholly
at
the
expense
of
individual
colonists
for
themselves
they
fought
for
themselves
they
conquered
and
for
themselves
alone
they
have
right
to
hold
no
aid
from
the
british
treasury
was
given
them
until
after
they
had
become
valuable
for
commercial
purposes
he
said
in
his
opinion
this
later
help
gave
no
title
to
the
authority
of
parliament
it
was
wholly
a
commercial
matter
and
could
be
repaid
by
trade
privileges
he
greatly
overstated
the
case
for
the
individual
settlers
who
could
not
have
survived
without
british
protection
prior
to
the
time
that
he
himself
became
grown
but
he
was
not
writing
history
he
was
trying
to
play
a
part
in
making
it
by
passionately
pleading
what
seemed
to
him
a
sacred
cause
these
settlers
having
emigrated
by
right
and
established
themselves
by
their
own
exertions
thought
proper
to
adopt
that
system
of
laws
under
which
they
had
hitherto
lived
in
the
mother
country
and
to
continue
their
union
with
her
by
submitting
themselves
to
the
same
common
sovereign
who
was
thereby
made
the
central
link
connecting
the
several
parts
of
the
empire
thus
newly
multiplied
he
claimed
that
there
was
a
compact
between
the
colonists
and
the
icing
which
was
embodied
partly
at
least
in
the
early
charters
he
by
no
means
regarded
these
charters
as
royal
gifts
on
the
contrary
he
emphasized
the
restrictions
that
they
imposed
on
royal
power
for
example
he
perceived
tyranny
in
the
stuart
practice
of
parceling
out
lands
to
favorites
and
in
erecting
new
governments
to
his
mind
this
family
of
princes
had
no
more
right
to
dismember
the
province
of
virginia
when
once
established
by
charter
than
they
had
to
divide
england
itself
the
stuarts
had
met
their
deserved
reward
however
and
he
found
more
pertinent
examples
of
arbitrary
power
in
later
acts
of
parliament
by
the
time
that
he
drafted
this
paper
jefferson
had
arrived
at
a
conclusion
which
would
have
caused
any
english
mercantilist
to
raise
his
eyebrows
namely
that
the
exercise
of
free
trade
with
all
parts
of
the
world
was
a
natural
right
of
the
colonists
no
law
of
their
own
had
taken
away
or
abridged
this
right
indeed
he
found
confirmation
of
it
in
the
solemn
treaty
of
march
between
the
commonwealth
and
the
house
of
burgesses
some
of
the
later
acts
for
the
regulation
of
commerce
seemed
to
him
indefensible
on
practical
grounds
but
his
most
important
assertion
was
this
the
true
ground
on
which
we
declare
these
acts
void
is
that
the
british
parliament
has
no
right
to
exercise
its
authority
over
us
his
historical
arguments
were
one
sided
and
in
the
scholar
s
sense
they
are
no
more
than
half
truths
his
grounds
were
not
historical
after
all
they
were
moral
he
lived
in
an
age
when
philosophers
as
well
as
statesmen
quoted
history
for
their
purposes
and
it
is
from
his
purposes
primarily
that
he
must
be
judged
these
were
clear
and
as
human
hearts
go
they
were
pure
his
chief
aim
was
to
overthrow
parliamentary
authority
which
had
been
unwise
in
practice
and
was
wrong
in
principle
and
at
the
same
time
to
safeguard
self
government
like
other
patriotic
pamphleteers
he
was
most
disturbed
not
by
restrictions
on
trade
but
by
parliamentary
meddling
with
the
internal
affairs
of
the
colonies
violations
of
right
were
less
alarming
during
the
reigns
immediately
before
that
of
george
iii
he
said
because
repeated
at
more
distant
intervals
than
that
rapid
and
bold
succession
of
injuries
which
is
likely
to
distinguish
the
present
from
all
other
periods
of
american
story
he
continued
scarcely
have
our
minds
been
able
to
emerge
from
the
astonishment
into
which
one
stroke
of
parliamentary
thunder
had
involved
us
before
another
more
heavy
and
more
alarming
is
fallen
on
us
single
acts
of
tyranny
may
be
ascribed
to
the
accidental
opinion
of
a
day
but
a
series
of
oppressions
begun
at
a
distinguished
period
and
pursued
unalterably
through
every
change
of
ministers
too
plainly
prove
a
deliberate
and
systematical
plan
of
reducing
us
to
slavery
he
used
strikingly
similar
language
two
years
later
then
laying
the
onus
not
on
parliament
but
on
the
king
and
thus
becoming
an
open
secessionist
he
cited
the
specific
acts
prior
to
which
formed
a
connected
chain
of
parliamentary
usurpation
speaking
at
considerable
length
and
with
great
emotion
about
the
suspension
of
the
legislature
of
new
york
which
had
occurred
even
before
he
became
a
burgess
one
free
and
independent
legislature
hereby
takes
upon
itself
to
suspend
the
powers
of
another
free
and
independent
as
itself
this
exhibiting
a
phenomenon
unknown
in
nature
he
said
the
measures
against
boston
which
had
precipitated
the
present
conflict
and
provided
the
occasion
for
his
own
pamphlet
he
regarded
as
acts
of
power
assumed
by
a
body
of
men
foreign
to
our
constitutions
and
unacknowledged
by
our
laws
he
admitted
that
the
actions
of
the
exasperated
participants
in
the
boston
tea
party
were
not
strictly
regular
that
these
men
did
wrong
in
destroying
the
obnoxious
commodity
and
that
they
were
properly
amenable
to
the
laws
of
the
land
that
is
to
the
laws
of
massachusetts
bay
but
the
coercive
acts
of
parliament
which
followed
this
famous
event
were
wholly
intolerable
to
him
he
entered
solemn
and
determined
protest
against
them
addressing
this
to
the
king
as
yet
the
only
mediatory
power
between
the
several
states
of
the
british
empire
at
the
same
time
he
boldly
pointed
out
the
king
s
own
deviations
from
the
line
of
duty
several
of
these
charges
reappeared
in
his
draft
of
the
declaration
of
independence
and
one
of
them
was
too
strong
for
the
stomachs
of
the
patriots
even
when
they
were
ready
to
renounce
allegiance
to
the
king
jefferson
erred
on
the
side
of
optimism
when
he
asserted
in
his
summary
view
that
the
abolition
of
domestic
slavery
was
the
great
object
of
desire
in
the
colonies
speaking
for
virginia
he
was
correct
in
saying
that
previous
attempts
to
prevent
importations
of
slaves
from
africa
had
been
defeated
by
the
royal
negative
no
doubt
he
caused
his
more
temperate
colleagues
to
shake
their
heads
however
when
he
termed
this
a
shameful
abuse
of
royal
power
which
showed
that
his
majesty
preferred
the
immediate
advantage
of
a
few
british
corsairs
to
the
lasting
interests
of
the
american
states
and
to
the
rights
of
human
nature
he
really
need
not
have
bothered
to
address
the
king
at
this
time
for
his
language
was
so
unconciliatory
as
to
doom
his
appeal
to
failure
one
of
his
more
positive
proposals
would
have
aroused
the
fears
of
the
english
whigs
immediately
if
they
had
been
disposed
to
pay
any
attention
to
this
rash
young
man
he
suggested
that
the
king
resume
the
exercise
of
his
negative
upon
parliamentary
legislation
in
order
to
prevent
the
passage
of
laws
injurious
to
other
parts
of
the
empire
this
was
one
way
of
saying
that
the
colonies
had
just
the
same
rights
as
england
and
he
hedged
the
king
about
with
restrictions
but
it
would
have
seemed
to
many
that
he
was
advocating
an
increase
of
royal
power
he
said
that
fortune
had
placed
the
king
in
a
post
where
he
held
the
balance
in
an
empire
and
that
this
empire
would
be
great
if
it
were
well
poised
the
latter
reflection
was
prophetic
more
important
than
his
specific
appeal
to
the
king
was
the
philosophy
which
underlay
it
this
left
no
place
for
royal
tyranny
or
for
tyranny
of
any
sort
he
regarded
himself
as
the
spokesman
of
a
free
people
who
had
derived
their
rights
from
god
and
the
laws
let
those
flatter
who
fear
he
said
it
is
not
an
american
art
to
give
praise
which
is
not
due
would
ill
beseem
those
who
are
asserting
the
rights
of
human
nature
they
know
and
will
therefore
say
that
kings
are
the
servants
not
the
proprietors
of
the
people
open
your
breast
sire
to
liberal
and
expanded
thought
let
not
the
name
of
george
the
third
be
a
blot
in
the
page
of
history
he
revealed
his
own
moral
emphasis
but
underrated
the
practical
difficulties
when
he
said
the
whole
art
of
government
consists
in
the
art
of
being
honest
it
is
doubtful
if
his
chiding
admonition
ever
reached
the
royal
ear
but
some
of
his
own
countrymen
remembered
that
he
had
subordinated
the
king
himself
to
natural
law
and
had
boldly
charged
him
with
specific
offenses
and
within
two
years
they
gave
him
opportunity
to
base
on
this
philosophy
a
convincing
justification
of
revolution
he
talked
little
of
colonial
concessions
but
at
the
moment
he
claimed
that
he
did
not
seek
independence
of
the
mother
country
it
is
neither
our
wish
nor
our
interest
to
separate
from
her
we
are
willing
on
our
part
to
sacrifice
everything
which
reason
can
ask
to
the
restoration
of
that
tranquillity
for
which
all
must
wish
on
their
part
let
them
be
ready
to
establish
union
on
a
generous
plan
let
them
name
their
terms
but
let
them
be
just
accept
of
every
commercial
preference
it
is
in
our
power
to
give
for
such
things
as
we
can
raise
for
their
use
or
they
make
for
ours
but
let
them
not
think
to
exclude
us
from
going
to
other
markets
to
dispose
of
those
commodities
which
they
cannot
use
or
to
supply
those
wants
which
they
cannot
supply
still
less
let
it
be
proposed
that
our
properties
within
our
own
territories
shall
be
taxed
or
regulated
by
any
power
on
earth
but
our
own
then
he
uttered
a
saying
which
of
itself
entitles
this
bold
pamphlet
to
immortality
it
belongs
not
to
the
american
colonies
but
to
mankind
not
to
the
year
merely
but
to
all
the
years
thereafter
the
god
who
gave
us
life
gave
us
liberty
at
the
same
time
the
hand
of
force
may
destroy
but
cannot
disjoin
them
from
the
beginnings
of
his
conspicuous
public
career
the
blessings
of
liberty
were
much
dearer
to
jefferson
than
those
of
empire
he
may
be
properly
charged
with
failure
to
appreciate
the
practical
problems
which
the
generally
incompetent
british
officials
of
his
time
were
facing
and
with
insistence
upon
a
degree
of
local
self
rule
which
not
even
the
english
friends
of
american
liberties
could
have
been
expected
to
concede
in
theory
the
sort
of
empire
he
advocated
and
the
only
sort
he
would
have
been
content
with
was
one
composed
of
self
governing
units
bound
together
only
by
mutual
benefits
in
recognizing
the
king
as
the
formal
tie
he
had
no
thought
of
substituting
an
omnipotent
monarch
for
an
omnipotent
parliament
to
his
mind
ultimate
authority
lay
in
the
laws
of
nature
and
the
human
beings
whom
god
had
made
free
day
to
day
authority
lay
in
the
various
local
legislatures
those
of
america
and
england
itself
the
king
was
the
mediator
but
he
was
subject
to
natural
law
the
ability
of
such
a
loose
jointed
empire
to
survive
any
serious
crisis
might
have
been
gravely
doubted
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
never
in
his
life
did
jefferson
value
political
organization
or
governmental
power
for
their
own
sakes
his
major
concern
was
for
the
ends
they
served
the
net
result
might
have
been
much
the
same
if
the
legislative
authority
of
parliament
in
external
matters
had
been
conceded
by
the
colonists
and
that
body
in
turn
had
sharply
restricted
itself
in
practice
even
if
the
alternative
had
been
clearly
presented
however
jefferson
would
have
thought
that
this
would
be
to
start
at
the
wrong
end
he
placed
his
faith
supremely
in
individuals
and
in
local
units
of
a
manageable
size
and
he
believed
that
the
power
to
grant
necessary
practical
concessions
should
be
left
with
them
there
is
no
evidence
that
this
pamphlet
led
to
the
threat
of
the
author
s
proscription
in
england
as
he
believed
or
that
it
was
utilized
by
the
opponents
of
the
ministry
if
it
had
any
immediate
effect
there
it
was
to
play
into
the
hands
of
the
ministry
who
were
seeking
to
justify
their
repressive
policy
by
claiming
that
the
americans
were
going
to
extremes
it
was
no
service
to
the
opposition
for
jefferson
to
press
his
theoretical
claims
and
he
had
definitely
parted
company
with
the
handful
of
english
leaders
who
were
still
championing
colonial
liberties
edmund
burke
had
a
liberal
concept
of
empire
and
regarded
the
american
love
of
freedom
as
an
inescapable
fact
but
that
eminent
conciliator
begged
the
philosophical
question
and
sought
a
solution
based
on
common
sense
he
avoided
a
refined
policy
eschewed
abstract
ideas
of
right
and
in
this
crisis
regarded
the
resort
to
mere
general
theories
of
government
as
arrant
trifling
jefferson
s
line
of
argument
would
not
have
appealed
to
him
and
certainly
the
young
virginian
did
not
at
this
time
see
eye
to
eye
with
chatham
though
in
many
ways
he
admired
him
for
that
great
imperialist
viewed
the
distinction
between
external
and
internal
control
as
sacred
he
conceded
to
the
colonies
the
right
of
taxation
but
the
supreme
power
of
parliament
to
regulate
commerce
he
would
yield
to
the
insistence
of
no
man
jefferson
s
first
important
political
paper
caused
him
to
appear
as
a
champion
of
freedom
and
self
government
who
would
yield
little
or
nothing
to
the
exigencies
of
the
moment
that
is
he
would
yield
practically
nothing
to
the
far
distant
mother
country
to
his
brethren
on
the
american
continent
on
the
other
hand
he
was
quite
prepared
to
make
concessions
individual
rights
and
local
self
government
came
first
in
his
thinking
but
he
fully
realized
the
necessity
for
concerted
action
on
a
continental
scale
and
had
a
clear
vision
of
colonial
union
in
this
sphere
he
was
no
impractical
theorist
nor
merely
a
long
range
prophet
but
a
realistic
statesman
he
had
played
an
important
part
in
the
creation
of
the
virginia
committee
of
correspondence
and
at
successive
stages
of
the
imperial
controversy
he
had
consistently
made
common
cause
with
the
patriots
of
other
provinces
it
would
be
improper
to
employ
the
term
nationalist
this
early
but
he
was
a
strong
unionist
from
the
start
no
saying
of
his
is
as
vivid
as
patrick
henry
s
at
the
first
continental
congress
i
am
not
a
virginian
but
an
american
neither
he
nor
the
fervid
orator
had
any
real
thought
of
ceasing
to
be
a
virginian
but
if
his
interests
were
not
imperial
they
were
far
more
than
provincial
they
had
assumed
a
continental
scope
in
the
year
he
gave
a
sign
of
this
which
could
not
have
been
expected
from
patrick
henry
not
long
after
the
adjournment
of
the
virginia
convention
he
received
from
another
province
a
printed
proposal
for
a
complete
collection
of
american
state
papers
the
man
who
sent
it
ebenezer
hazard
then
living
in
new
york
became
a
pioneer
editor
of
historical
records
while
the
patriotic
gentleman
who
received
it
in
albemarle
county
afterwards
performed
distinctive
service
as
a
collector
of
americana
the
episode
was
prophetic
jefferson
proceeded
to
get
an
impressive
list
of
subscribers
from
his
friends
and
neighbors
and
left
hazard
in
no
possible
doubt
of
his
enthusiastic
patronage
these
actions
had
to
do
with
the
past
with
curious
monuments
of
the
infancy
of
our
country
as
he
afterwards
described
them
they
illustrate
at
this
early
date
the
lifelong
americanism
which
accompanied
his
loyalty
to
virginia
and
which
to
his
mind
conflicted
with
it
in
no
way
of
more
immediate
importance
as
reflecting
his
unionism
was
a
private
comment
which
he
made
on
the
limited
sovereignty
of
the
continental
congress
a
score
of
years
later
when
he
sought
to
limit
the
centralizing
tendencies
which
alexander
hamilton
personified
his
undiscriminating
political
foes
might
have
found
this
early
observation
of
his
surprising
we
are
to
conform
to
such
resolutions
only
of
the
congress
as
our
deputies
assent
to
which
totally
destroys
that
union
of
conduct
in
the
several
colonies
which
was
the
very
purpose
of
calling
a
congress
this
illuminating
comment
on
the
dangerous
limitations
of
congressional
power
was
coupled
with
others
of
a
critical
nature
on
the
association
which
congress
adopted
in
october
he
did
not
wholly
approve
of
that
famous
non
importation
nonconsumption
agreement
not
because
it
went
too
far
though
he
disliked
certain
of
its
details
but
because
it
did
not
go
far
enough
he
duly
signed
his
printed
copy
notwithstanding
and
he
had
others
attach
their
names
to
it
among
these
were
his
young
brother
randolph
who
was
now
nineteen
his
brother
in
law
francis
eppes
and
his
violin
teacher
francis
alberti
he
intended
to
be
a
conscientious
observer
of
the
measures
generally
thought
requisite
for
a
preservation
of
our
independent
rights
he
said
and
he
was
much
embarrassed
in
december
by
one
of
his
own
orders
which
turned
out
to
be
in
violation
of
them
the
restrictions
came
at
an
unfortunate
time
for
him
since
he
was
engaged
in
building
operations
some
months
earlier
he
had
ordered
for
use
at
monticello
fourteen
pairs
of
sash
windows
and
these
were
now
en
route
despite
his
countermand
he
fully
expected
his
glazed
windows
to
be
condemned
when
they
reached
the
virginia
shore
however
and
he
acquiesced
in
this
infringement
on
his
liberty
as
an
individual
he
bowed
to
virtual
necessity
beyond
a
doubt
for
in
virginia
the
provisions
for
the
enforcement
of
the
association
were
rigorously
carried
out
congress
had
enjoined
that
every
county
town
and
city
should
choose
a
committee
to
observe
the
conduct
of
all
persons
respecting
the
agreement
to
publish
the
names
of
offenders
and
thus
to
cause
the
enemies
of
american
liberty
to
be
condemned
and
outlawed
this
was
high
handed
action
which
a
theoretical
advocate
of
personal
freedom
might
have
been
expected
to
condemn
but
there
is
no
indication
that
jefferson
questioned
its
essential
wisdom
and
there
is
evidence
that
he
played
a
patriotic
part
in
carrying
the
restrictions
into
effect
the
albemarle
committee
was
not
among
the
first
to
be
elected
the
earliest
work
of
organization
in
virginia
was
done
in
the
eastern
counties
when
a
committee
was
selected
however
his
name
was
the
first
upon
the
list
followed
by
that
of
his
friend
and
fellow
burgess
john
walker
in
late
and
early
he
was
not
only
the
first
citizen
of
his
county
but
its
first
patriot
as
well
meanwhile
in
the
neighboring
county
of
orange
young
james
madison
had
been
elected
as
a
member
of
a
similar
committee
and
service
on
it
constituted
his
introduction
to
public
life
no
less
a
person
than
lord
dunmore
is
authority
for
the
statement
that
the
county
committees
now
constituted
virtually
the
only
government
in
the
province
there
is
not
a
justice
of
the
peace
in
virginia
that
acts
except
as
a
committee
man
he
said
thus
he
testified
to
the
suspension
of
the
county
courts
as
he
also
did
to
the
great
unwillingness
of
lawyers
to
attend
the
general
court
which
was
now
largely
restricted
to
criminal
cases
this
was
what
jefferson
meant
when
he
said
that
the
revolution
shut
up
the
courts
of
justice
and
ended
his
own
career
as
a
practising
lawyer
the
last
case
that
he
listed
in
his
formal
record
was
dated
nov
and
was
numbered
this
referred
only
to
an
opinion
on
a
will
anyway
so
to
all
practical
purposes
his
legal
career
ended
before
that
he
turned
over
his
unfinished
cases
to
young
edmund
randolph
son
of
the
attorney
general
apparently
expecting
to
abandon
practice
for
good
he
would
have
been
fully
war
anted
in
doing
so
even
if
times
had
been
more
peaceful
for
the
wayles
inheritance
had
greatly
increased
his
burdens
as
a
man
of
business
while
relieving
him
of
any
need
to
supplement
his
income
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
however
that
he
welcomed
the
closing
of
the
courts
in
order
to
escape
his
own
debts
to
british
merchants
as
dunmore
and
some
of
his
partisans
asserted
that
many
of
the
planters
did
he
had
provided
for
his
debts
or
so
at
least
he
thought
nor
did
he
have
the
desire
or
occasion
to
apply
tar
and
feathers
as
a
local
committeeman
there
was
little
violence
or
disorder
among
these
people
who
were
so
accustomed
to
self
government
in
the
middle
of
march
jefferson
set
out
for
richmond
to
attend
a
provincial
convention
as
the
first
delegate
from
his
county
he
had
no
reason
whatever
to
suppose
that
his
appeal
to
the
king
or
any
other
had
been
heeded
his
knowledge
of
occurrences
in
england
was
at
least
two
months
behind
the
events
themselves
but
by
the
month
of
february
he
could
have
read
in
the
virginia
gazette
a
speech
of
george
iii
at
the
opening
of
parliament
and
the
addresses
of
the
lords
and
commons
which
strongly
supported
it
he
undoubtedly
knew
that
the
opposition
to
the
policy
of
coercion
had
been
ruthlessly
beaten
down
the
king
had
complained
bitterly
of
violences
of
a
very
criminal
nature
in
massachusetts
and
of
unwarrantable
attempts
to
obstruct
commerce
and
had
assured
parliament
of
his
determination
to
withstand
every
attempt
to
weaken
or
impair
its
supreme
authority
such
attitudes
were
irreconcilable
with
the
views
jefferson
had
expressed
and
thus
he
must
have
reflected
as
he
took
the
richmond
road
before
the
convention
assembled
however
a
later
item
appeared
in
the
virginia
gazette
this
reported
that
the
petition
of
congress
to
the
king
had
been
received
in
london
the
day
before
christmas
and
had
been
duly
communicated
to
lord
dartmouth
the
petition
led
to
no
change
in
policy
but
the
virginians
did
not
know
that
yet
some
of
them
seized
upon
what
appeared
to
be
a
fresh
hope
of
conciliation
as
patrick
henry
and
thomas
jefferson
soon
found
out
the
virginia
convention
of
march
amounted
to
a
meeting
of
the
burgesses
without
the
authorization
of
the
governor
and
it
was
held
at
a
place
where
they
were
wholly
free
from
his
control
richmond
was
a
central
point
though
by
no
means
a
city
and
the
sessions
were
held
in
the
structure
known
to
history
as
old
saint
john
s
church
it
was
a
simple
white
building
and
its
atmosphere
befitted
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
here
patrick
henry
uttered
his
most
famous
words
give
me
liberty
or
give
me
death
the
clash
of
resounding
arms
had
not
yet
been
heard
at
lexington
and
concord
but
he
believed
war
inevitable
unless
the
colonists
should
become
abject
he
said
let
it
come
so
far
as
is
known
jefferson
did
not
say
that
but
he
strongly
supported
henry
s
resolutions
even
going
so
far
as
to
make
a
speech
the
just
fame
of
patrick
henry
as
a
revolutionary
statesman
is
attributable
to
his
insistence
upon
decisive
action
in
successive
crises
no
one
else
did
so
much
as
he
to
give
impetus
to
the
ball
of
revolution
in
the
province
jefferson
said
that
several
times
but
unlike
henry
s
biographers
he
did
not
magnify
the
importance
of
this
particular
occasion
he
did
not
regard
it
as
the
beginning
of
the
revolution
henry
s
audacity
in
urging
defense
measures
at
this
time
and
jefferson
s
in
backing
him
should
not
be
exaggerated
there
had
already
been
considerable
military
preparation
in
virginia
and
the
citizens
generally
were
in
a
resolute
state
of
mind
three
months
before
this
lord
dunmore
had
reported
that
independent
companies
of
militia
were
being
formed
in
the
contester
protect
the
committees
he
said
dissatisfied
with
the
colorless
resolutions
which
had
been
presented
to
the
convention
henry
introduced
more
vigorous
ones
he
moved
that
steps
be
taken
by
the
colony
as
a
whole
and
that
a
committee
be
chosen
to
prepare
a
plan
for
embodying
arming
and
disciplining
a
sufficient
number
of
men
since
such
action
gave
promise
of
greater
unity
and
effectiveness
it
was
naturally
favored
by
a
realist
like
george
washington
the
support
of
this
man
of
solid
worth
was
invaluable
but
he
was
characteristically
silent
the
more
philosophical
jefferson
was
not
he
argued
closely
profoundly
and
warmly
on
the
side
of
the
redoubtable
patrick
henry
and
eloquent
richard
henry
lee
otherwise
designated
as
demosthenes
and
cicero
his
post
in
the
debate
being
that
at
which
the
theories
of
republicanism
were
deposited
they
managed
to
carry
the
resolutions
but
the
vote
was
dangerously
close
the
opposing
conservatives
could
hardly
have
been
against
arming
the
colony
at
a
time
when
the
citizens
were
already
arming
themselves
and
most
if
not
all
of
these
delegates
were
active
in
connection
with
the
county
committees
ostensibly
they
objected
to
the
timing
of
the
action
men
like
robert
carter
nicholas
edmund
pendleton
benjamin
harrison
and
richard
bland
still
had
hopes
of
conciliation
and
clung
to
the
proprieties
beneath
the
surface
of
the
resolutions
furthermore
they
suspected
deeper
designs
on
the
part
of
henry
apparently
he
purposed
that
the
committee
should
assume
the
full
powers
of
government
many
of
which
had
already
slipped
from
the
governor
s
hands
however
his
scheme
was
scotched
and
thus
it
came
about
that
this
was
not
a
revolutionary
gathering
after
all
jefferson
was
a
member
of
the
committee
of
twelve
that
was
set
up
to
prepare
a
plan
for
the
militia
though
his
name
was
next
to
the
last
while
henry
s
was
first
the
plan
which
was
adopted
was
innocuous
enough
in
general
the
convention
regularized
and
provided
for
the
enlargement
of
the
county
organizations
which
had
already
sprung
up
independently
more
picturesquely
it
recognized
the
tomahawk
as
standard
equipment
along
with
the
rifle
and
prescribed
as
uniform
the
hunting
shirt
the
militiamen
were
already
good
shots
and
some
of
them
afterwards
printed
liberty
or
death
on
their
hunting
shirts
but
they
did
not
become
an
effective
military
body
under
centralized
control
because
an
orator
made
an
immortal
speech
jefferson
may
have
wanted
the
patriots
to
assume
the
full
form
of
governmental
authority
at
this
time
since
they
had
already
assumed
so
much
of
the
substance
yet
despite
his
radicalism
on
the
imperial
question
and
the
uncompromising
spirit
he
had
manifested
in
his
pamphlet
of
the
previous
summer
the
presumption
is
that
he
did
not
his
later
silence
about
the
meeting
suggests
that
there
was
something
about
it
that
he
did
not
like
and
even
if
he
had
favored
taking
this
revolutionary
step
in
advance
of
actual
bloodshed
he
was
willing
to
modify
his
natural
pace
in
the
interest
of
unity
a
motion
of
his
own
in
the
convention
reveals
his
continuing
concern
for
unity
in
the
colonies
this
merely
called
upon
the
committee
of
correspondence
to
inquire
about
the
state
of
sentiment
in
the
province
of
new
york
where
as
the
newspapers
reported
there
had
been
a
defection
of
the
house
of
representatives
from
the
association
it
is
the
language
not
the
substance
of
jefferson
s
resolution
that
is
significant
to
his
mind
a
defection
from
the
compact
of
association
was
an
atrocious
perfidy
a
desertion
of
the
union
with
the
other
american
colonies
formed
in
general
congress
for
the
preservation
of
their
just
rights
he
was
unwilling
to
condemn
the
new
yorkers
on
the
basis
of
hearsay
but
he
left
no
possible
doubt
of
his
own
determination
that
the
union
should
be
preserved
one
late
action
at
this
meeting
turned
out
to
be
important
to
him
personally
the
convention
re
elected
its
delegation
to
congress
leaving
peyton
randolph
at
its
head
next
after
the
perennial
presiding
officer
came
washington
and
henry
but
until
the
last
day
of
the
session
the
name
of
jefferson
was
still
absent
from
the
list
then
he
was
appointed
a
deputy
to
serve
in
case
of
randolph
s
nonattendance
if
he
had
cared
to
be
mathematical
he
might
have
regarded
himself
as
one
of
the
first
eight
or
ten
leaders
of
virginia
despite
his
abilities
and
zeal
he
could
hardly
have
expected
to
stand
higher
than
that
as
yet
for
he
was
only
thirty
two
he
went
to
philadelphia
in
the
summer
after
peyton
randolph
was
called
home
and
by
that
time
the
appeal
to
reason
had
given
place
to
the
appeal
to
arms
xv
a
patriot
goes
to
philadelphia
in
news
did
not
travel
with
the
speed
of
sound
jefferson
heard
the
report
of
the
shots
at
lexington
and
concord
about
two
weeks
after
the
embattled
farmers
fired
them
this
was
in
early
may
more
than
a
month
after
the
adjournment
of
the
convention
in
richmond
meanwhile
he
had
brought
his
little
family
from
elkhill
on
the
james
where
they
had
been
staying
back
to
monticello
and
there
had
observed
with
sorrow
the
damage
a
late
frost
had
done
to
his
hillside
orchard
soon
however
he
was
gratified
by
events
in
his
stable
before
he
was
plunged
again
into
public
affairs
he
made
this
entry
in
his
faithful
account
book
allycroker
s
colt
by
young
fearnought
was
foaled
may
he
named
the
colt
caractacus
and
recorded
his
lineage
with
pride
on
the
paternal
side
it
was
particularly
distinguished
for
old
fearnought
sire
of
young
fearnought
was
the
most
famous
stallion
of
his
time
in
the
province
and
he
and
his
sons
were
treated
with
royal
deference
caractacus
was
not
only
the
latest
of
the
blooded
horses
at
monticello
he
indisputably
belonged
to
the
first
equine
family
of
virginia
on
the
same
day
in
may
that
he
acquired
a
future
mount
jefferson
sat
down
to
write
a
letter
to
dr
william
small
in
england
his
ostensible
purpose
was
to
tell
his
old
teacher
he
was
sending
him
three
dozen
bottles
of
madeira
but
inevitably
he
spoke
of
the
action
between
the
king
s
troops
and
his
own
brethren
of
the
bay
colony
he
had
learned
of
it
just
that
week
and
spoke
of
it
as
an
accident
but
he
reported
that
a
phrenzy
of
revenge
had
seized
upon
all
ranks
of
the
people
the
phrenzy
of
revenge
in
virginia
was
not
wholly
due
to
news
from
the
north
according
to
one
of
lord
dunmore
s
few
partisans
the
brush
at
lexington
and
concord
was
only
a
yankee
trick
designed
to
alarm
and
involve
the
other
colonies
jefferson
would
have
vigorously
disputed
that
assertion
but
before
he
learned
of
events
near
boston
his
own
governor
had
aroused
fierce
local
indignation
on
the
night
of
april
dunmore
removed
from
the
magazine
in
williamsburg
the
powder
belonging
to
the
colony
that
was
stored
there
and
placed
it
on
a
british
schooner
in
the
james
river
this
high
handed
action
provided
the
oratorical
patrick
henry
with
an
opportunity
to
become
a
man
of
stirring
deeds
he
led
an
independent
company
from
hanover
toward
the
capital
and
although
he
did
not
restore
the
powder
he
managed
to
secure
its
value
in
money
dun
more
in
turn
fortified
the
palace
put
his
wife
and
children
on
a
man
of
war
and
declared
henry
an
outlaw
thus
making
him
more
than
ever
the
hero
of
the
populace
jefferson
was
not
that
sort
of
man
on
horseback
even
after
caractacus
had
grown
up
but
he
soon
went
to
williamsburg
for
important
public
reasons
lord
dunmore
had
called
the
assembly
to
meet
ironical
as
that
action
seemed
the
governor
gained
some
comfort
from
the
thought
that
patrick
henry
whom
he
regarded
as
a
man
of
desperate
circumstances
would
be
at
a
safe
destination
congress
along
with
other
leading
whig
characters
of
the
colony
also
he
had
certain
conciliatory
proposals
of
lord
north
s
to
present
jefferson
said
that
these
constituted
the
major
reason
for
calling
the
assembly
and
that
his
own
desire
to
answer
them
was
the
main
reason
why
he
attended
otherwise
he
would
have
gone
straight
to
philadelphia
to
replace
peyton
randolph
for
that
massive
statesman
had
hastened
back
to
preside
over
the
burgesses
being
succeeded
in
the
chair
of
the
continental
congress
by
john
hancock
jefferson
spent
only
ten
days
in
the
assembly
but
these
were
busy
and
exciting
the
burgesses
pressed
the
question
of
the
gunpowder
and
soon
threw
dunmore
into
utter
panic
on
the
eighth
day
of
the
session
he
became
so
fearful
of
his
personal
security
that
he
joined
his
family
on
the
man
of
war
fowey
and
transacted
business
thereafter
on
shipboard
to
the
virginians
he
was
chiefly
a
nuisance
after
that
before
the
lord
took
flight
jefferson
served
on
a
committee
which
drafted
an
address
and
confronted
the
short
dark
man
in
person
the
governor
had
called
the
assembly
to
consider
the
alarming
situation
of
the
country
but
the
committee
flung
the
words
back
in
his
teeth
by
blaming
this
situation
wholly
on
the
british
ministry
the
most
interesting
passage
in
this
address
dealt
with
the
courts
which
dunmore
wished
to
reopen
to
civil
cases
by
this
time
the
debts
to
british
merchants
had
become
a
major
consideration
on
both
sides
jefferson
agreed
with
his
fellows
that
debtors
should
not
be
sued
by
their
british
creditors
since
the
cessation
of
commerce
had
now
made
it
impossible
for
them
to
sell
their
tobacco
money
my
lord
is
not
a
plant
of
the
native
growth
of
this
country
the
committee
said
jefferson
drafted
the
reply
to
lord
north
s
motion
though
this
was
not
adopted
in
final
form
until
after
he
had
left
for
philadelphia
the
proposal
in
brief
was
that
any
colony
which
should
make
such
a
contribution
to
the
defense
of
the
empire
and
such
fixed
provision
for
the
support
of
its
own
civil
government
as
met
the
approval
of
parliament
should
be
exempted
henceforth
from
imperial
taxation
for
revenue
lord
dunmore
was
not
notably
acute
but
he
was
sufficiently
so
to
expect
little
enthusiasm
for
this
plan
in
the
virginia
assembly
whose
violence
of
temper
had
already
been
manifested
the
newspapers
had
prejudiced
the
people
against
the
proposal
he
said
they
called
it
a
device
to
divide
the
colonies
and
insisted
that
no
negotiations
whatever
be
begun
until
all
the
objectionable
acts
of
parliament
had
been
repealed
in
england
lord
chatham
had
urged
just
such
a
repeal
and
jefferson
believed
that
the
rejected
resolutions
of
that
statesman
would
have
offered
real
hope
of
conciliation
this
he
said
despite
the
fact
that
they
also
called
for
the
express
recognition
of
parliamentary
authority
which
he
himself
had
explicitly
denied
the
strong
supposition
was
that
this
authority
would
be
exercised
primarily
if
not
solely
in
the
field
of
external
relations
and
as
a
practical
man
he
concluded
that
these
terms
might
have
been
accommodated
with
those
offered
by
congress
the
burgesses
would
have
rejected
lord
north
s
terms
even
if
jefferson
had
not
been
there
though
he
may
have
had
to
overcome
the
scruples
of
robert
carter
nicholas
and
others
as
he
said
the
admirable
address
which
was
adopted
was
considerably
more
moderate
in
tone
than
the
summary
view
and
it
is
possible
that
he
was
not
responsible
for
the
whole
of
it
on
the
other
hand
he
had
learned
something
about
practical
statesmanship
since
the
summer
of
as
his
comment
on
chatham
showed
and
the
fact
that
this
was
an
official
pronouncement
imposed
inevitable
restraint
polite
as
the
reply
was
it
was
wholly
firm
and
entirely
without
comfort
to
lords
north
and
dunmore
the
proposal
only
changed
the
form
of
oppression
without
lightening
the
burden
the
committee
said
and
for
half
a
dozen
reasons
they
would
not
accept
it
the
first
one
was
that
parliament
had
no
right
to
meddle
with
the
support
of
civil
government
in
the
colonies
the
language
of
this
objection
showed
clearly
the
jeffersonian
touch
for
us
not
for
them
has
government
been
instituted
here
the
colony
of
virginia
was
unwilling
to
saddle
itself
with
a
perpetual
contribution
that
was
expendable
by
parliament
i
not
merely
was
the
mode
of
raising
money
objected
to
the
freedom
of
granting
it
was
also
contended
for
furthermore
the
objectionable
acts
of
parliament
were
unrepealed
and
while
asking
for
a
gift
the
british
were
making
dispositions
to
invade
america
this
sort
of
procedure
could
not
be
reconciled
with
american
freedom
there
was
inconsistency
also
in
asking
for
a
proportionate
payment
for
imperial
defence
without
granting
to
the
colonies
a
free
trade
with
all
the
world
this
objection
sounds
just
like
jefferson
so
does
the
last
and
most
important
one
we
consider
ourselves
as
bound
in
honour
as
well
as
interest
to
share
one
general
fate
with
our
sister
colonies
and
would
hold
ourselves
base
deserters
of
that
union
to
which
we
have
acceded
were
we
to
agree
on
any
measures
distinct
and
apart
from
them
these
were
unionist
words
quite
in
line
with
jefferson
s
convictions
and
they
were
also
the
language
of
common
sense
before
this
strong
calm
paper
was
finally
approved
jefferson
had
set
out
in
his
phaeton
for
philadelphia
nine
years
earlier
he
had
gone
to
the
colonial
metropolis
to
be
inoculated
against
smallpox
but
this
was
the
first
time
he
ever
left
his
native
province
on
a
public
mission
he
made
many
other
trips
to
philadelphia
in
later
months
and
years
and
the
immediate
results
of
some
of
them
were
of
much
greater
historical
importance
but
this
one
was
more
memorable
than
any
other
in
that
it
marked
his
entrance
on
the
continental
stage
as
a
public
man
but
for
the
challenge
of
political
crisis
he
would
have
continued
to
be
a
prosperous
planter
a
responsible
local
leader
a
humane
and
enlightened
virginian
who
operated
of
necessity
within
a
restricted
sphere
and
spent
most
of
his
time
at
home
when
he
ferried
across
the
potomac
on
his
way
to
the
continental
congress
he
crossed
his
rubicon
he
did
not
at
that
time
abandon
local
responsibilities
but
he
appeared
unmistakably
as
an
american
as
a
champion
of
rights
which
were
confined
by
no
boundary
line
the
merger
of
his
private
life
with
public
pursuits
was
still
incomplete
but
there
could
be
no
turning
back
and
from
this
date
onward
his
story
becomes
an
integral
part
of
the
history
of
the
republic
not
until
another
year
did
he
and
his
fellow
patriots
become
open
revolutionaries
but
he
was
determined
to
secure
a
redress
of
the
colonial
grievances
which
he
had
already
described
so
sweepingly
he
afterwards
said
that
the
virginia
planters
were
a
species
of
property
annexed
to
certain
mercantile
houses
in
london
but
primarily
his
motives
were
neither
economic
nor
personal
actually
he
was
more
prosperous
now
than
he
ever
was
afterwards
and
his
happiness
as
a
husband
and
father
had
just
come
into
flower
on
purely
personal
grounds
he
ought
to
have
been
a
conservative
but
as
he
said
he
was
drawn
into
public
affairs
by
emergencies
which
threatened
our
country
with
slavery
but
ended
by
establishing
it
free
this
he
said
after
he
had
paid
the
price
of
liberty
and
knew
how
great
it
was
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
he
regarded
the
issues
of
these
years
as
momentous
to
him
this
was
no
mere
local
struggle
but
one
of
those
great
crises
which
come
but
once
in
a
millennium
or
at
least
he
thought
that
until
the
vaster
cataclysm
in
france
showed
him
that
such
things
could
happen
twice
in
a
single
lifetime
such
an
emergency
warranted
the
neglect
of
his
extensive
private
affairs
separation
from
his
family
and
any
other
sacrifices
which
might
be
demanded
the
details
of
his
important
journey
to
philadelphia
are
interesting
and
informing
on
the
day
before
he
left
williamsburg
he
received
from
the
treasurer
of
the
colony
for
the
use
of
the
virginia
delegates
the
expenses
of
the
various
delegations
were
borne
locally
and
continued
to
be
until
the
constitution
of
went
into
effect
as
paymasters
the
individual
colonies
not
congress
called
the
tune
in
virginia
these
funds
were
raised
by
subscription
and
jefferson
himself
had
made
a
contribution
he
could
well
afford
to
do
so
and
he
was
in
a
generous
frame
of
mind
the
future
champion
of
democracy
traveled
impressively
by
the
time
he
reached
philadelphia
he
had
four
horses
one
of
these
an
animal
named
general
sired
by
the
noted
janus
and
six
years
old
he
purchased
for
in
fredericksburg
where
he
remained
three
days
and
also
bought
harness
a
pestilence
whip
and
swingletrees
he
had
at
least
two
servants
jesse
who
rode
postilion
and
richard
apparently
a
body
servant
after
he
crossed
the
potomac
and
came
into
another
country
he
began
to
keep
his
records
in
maryland
currency
the
exchange
fortunately
being
favorable
to
virginia
he
may
have
been
struck
by
the
difficulties
and
annoyances
arising
from
the
lack
of
a
uniform
inter
colonial
medium
but
the
problem
was
not
serious
the
rest
of
the
way
since
the
currency
of
pennsylvania
and
delaware
was
on
a
par
with
that
of
maryland
this
sort
of
information
he
invariably
jotted
down
in
annapolis
he
stopped
long
enough
to
have
the
pole
of
his
phaeton
mended
he
visited
the
seat
of
government
as
he
had
done
nine
years
before
also
he
availed
himself
of
the
opportunity
to
purchase
books
beyond
wilmington
not
being
sure
of
his
way
he
hired
a
guide
and
horse
at
no
small
cost
the
total
distance
from
williamsburg
to
philadelphia
by
the
common
route
was
approximately
miles
but
because
of
his
stops
he
took
ten
days
to
cover
it
that
was
a
slow
moving
age
and
he
never
lived
to
see
a
fast
one
soon
he
had
to
say
good
by
to
one
prominent
delegate
from
his
country
two
days
after
he
arrived
grave
news
came
from
bunker
hill
and
on
the
day
after
that
george
washington
recently
elected
commander
of
the
continental
forces
set
out
for
the
camp
before
boston
a
troop
of
light
horse
in
uniform
numerous
militia
officers
all
of
the
delegates
from
massachusetts
and
many
other
delegates
accompanied
the
general
for
a
little
way
jefferson
was
probably
among
them
as
john
adams
was
hearing
the
martial
music
and
viewing
the
pomp
of
war
congress
had
been
in
session
for
about
six
weeks
and
it
sat
for
almost
as
many
more
before
recessing
during
this
period
jefferson
and
one
or
both
of
his
servants
lodged
with
a
cabinetmaker
named
benjamin
randolph
the
cost
of
his
lodgings
however
was
only
about
half
of
that
of
keeping
his
four
horses
he
had
an
account
at
the
city
tavern
and
generally
took
dinner
and
supper
there
probably
he
fell
heir
to
the
place
of
peyton
randolph
or
george
washington
at
the
daily
table
which
had
been
formed
earlier
by
them
along
with
richard
henry
lee
benjamin
harrison
and
four
other
delegates
he
bought
all
sorts
of
things
in
this
enticing
market
including
books
and
music
and
he
paid
a
barber
for
shaving
him
by
the
week
the
times
were
perilous
but
he
faced
them
as
a
fine
gentleman
congressional
duties
left
him
little
opportunity
for
pleasure
however
the
sessions
in
the
state
house
later
known
as
independence
hall
began
at
nine
and
continued
till
four
or
five
and
sometimes
until
six
and
committees
often
met
in
the
evening
as
the
hot
summer
wore
on
attention
to
business
became
more
and
more
painful
to
all
and
as
many
remarked
the
results
of
the
lengthy
deliberations
were
small
the
sixty
odd
delegates
did
not
comprise
a
numerous
body
actually
the
house
of
burgesses
was
larger
but
this
was
an
unwieldy
body
its
progress
must
be
slow
wrote
john
adams
to
his
wife
it
is
like
a
large
fleet
sailing
under
convoy
the
fleetest
sailors
must
wait
for
the
dullest
and
slowest
like
a
coach
and
six
the
swiftest
horses
must
be
slackened
and
the
slowest
quickened
that
all
may
keep
an
even
pace
unanimity
among
the
delegations
was
necessary
for
the
passing
of
any
motion
or
resolution
and
even
samuel
adams
realized
how
hard
it
was
to
arrive
at
that
jefferson
was
constant
in
attendance
though
he
was
a
silent
member
in
debate
he
felt
no
chagrin
for
that
saying
later
that
washington
and
franklin
also
disliked
the
disputation
of
the
legislative
floor
on
committees
and
in
conversation
however
he
was
prompt
frank
explicit
and
decisive
john
adams
believed
that
not
even
samuel
adams
was
more
so
and
said
that
the
young
virginian
soon
seized
upon
his
heart
thus
he
dated
the
beginning
of
an
historic
friendship
john
adams
remembered
that
jefferson
brought
with
him
to
congress
a
reputation
for
literature
science
and
a
happy
talent
for
composition
and
recorded
a
few
months
after
he
first
met
him
the
earliest
known
tribute
to
his
linguistic
attainments
and
ambitions
he
reported
james
duane
of
new
york
as
saying
that
jefferson
was
the
greatest
rubber
off
of
dust
that
he
had
met
with
that
he
had
learned
french
italian
spanish
and
wanted
to
learn
german
the
familiar
statement
that
writings
of
his
were
passed
around
remarkable
for
their
peculiar
felicity
of
expression
was
not
contemporary
bur
if
the
reputation
of
his
masterly
pen
was
not
firmly
established
in
june
he
was
clearly
predestined
to
paper
work
from
the
beginning
of
his
congressional
career
no
other
virginian
in
attendance
except
possibly
pendleton
had
like
diligence
or
skill
in
it
both
patrick
henry
and
richard
henry
lee
were
primarily
speakers
and
in
the
previous
congress
they
had
proved
disappointing
as
draftsmen
benjamin
harrison
was
a
large
cheerful
gentleman
and
something
of
a
wit
but
he
had
gained
no
laurels
as
a
writer
obviously
the
most
populous
colony
must
be
represented
on
committees
which
drew
important
papers
and
the
youngest
and
most
literary
member
of
the
delegation
was
inevitably
called
on
only
a
few
days
after
he
had
taken
his
seat
a
committee
reported
a
declaration
on
the
necessity
of
taking
up
arms
which
congress
deemed
unsatisfactory
the
original
committee
consisted
of
john
rutledge
of
south
carolina
who
is
supposed
to
have
done
the
drafting
william
livingston
of
new
jersey
john
jay
benjamin
franklin
and
thomas
johnson
of
maryland
to
their
number
john
dickinson
the
writer
of
the
well
known
letters
from
a
farmer
of
pennsylvania
and
jefferson
were
now
added
it
is
a
pity
that
no
photographer
was
present
when
he
and
franklin
first
bowed
to
each
other
and
that
no
stenographer
recorded
the
first
words
they
spoke
the
eminent
doctor
had
recently
returned
from
england
and
his
conduct
at
this
time
was
grave
and
modest
though
he
was
bold
in
counsel
whenever
his
opinion
was
sought
jefferson
who
liked
the
conjunction
of
intellectual
boldness
with
learning
and
modest
manners
probably
took
to
him
from
the
start
this
was
the
beginning
of
jefferson
s
important
association
with
john
jay
who
was
even
younger
than
he
was
and
of
his
long
friendship
with
rutledge
his
first
clash
appears
to
have
been
with
john
dickinson
whom
he
always
regarded
as
an
honest
man
though
he
did
not
like
the
way
his
mind
worked
jefferson
was
asked
to
draft
a
new
paper
but
as
he
remembered
dickinson
objected
to
this
as
too
harsh
committeeman
livingston
commented
on
it
at
the
time
we
are
now
july
working
on
a
manifesto
on
arming
he
wrote
the
first
was
not
liked
by
the
congress
and
was
recommitted
the
second
was
not
liked
by
the
committee
both
had
the
faults
common
to
our
southern
gentlemen
much
fault
finding
and
declamation
with
little
sense
or
dignity
they
seem
to
think
a
reiteration
of
tyranny
despotism
bloody
c
all
that
is
needed
to
unite
us
at
home
and
to
convince
the
bribed
voters
of
the
north
of
the
justice
of
our
cause
like
all
of
jefferson
s
writings
about
the
imperial
controversy
this
paper
burns
with
a
sense
of
injustice
but
it
was
much
less
impetuous
than
his
summary
view
and
cannot
properly
be
described
as
declamatory
he
made
two
drafts
and
when
set
side
by
side
they
show
that
he
weighed
his
words
he
used
alternative
expressions
as
he
did
when
drawing
the
declaration
of
independence
and
afterwards
struck
out
the
ones
that
seemed
less
desirable
he
had
now
entered
upon
his
most
fastidious
stage
as
a
literary
craftsman
his
arguments
however
were
largely
those
he
had
used
previously
and
the
real
objection
of
dickinson
was
not
so
much
to
the
harshness
of
his
phrases
as
to
his
basic
theory
of
empire
the
older
man
was
asked
to
draw
another
paper
and
with
minor
amendments
it
was
adopted
he
incorporated
part
of
jefferson
s
draft
and
used
expressions
of
his
own
which
were
almost
if
not
quite
as
severe
he
did
not
achieve
as
logical
a
sequence
of
ideas
or
as
smooth
a
literary
effect
however
and
he
begged
the
question
of
the
precise
authority
of
parliament
within
the
empire
thus
leaving
a
wider
door
to
conciliation
as
jefferson
said
and
dickinson
repeated
the
actions
of
the
british
government
had
compelled
the
americans
to
change
the
ground
of
opposition
and
to
accept
the
appeal
from
reason
to
arms
but
jefferson
sought
approval
before
supreme
reason
spoke
of
charters
of
compact
that
had
been
freely
made
and
again
termed
the
king
the
link
between
the
several
parts
of
the
empire
he
did
not
explicitly
deny
all
parliamentary
authority
as
he
had
done
previously
but
he
did
so
by
implication
this
was
still
too
strong
a
dose
for
the
farmer
of
pennsylvania
some
of
jefferson
s
more
striking
expressions
were
retained
in
the
final
draft
and
can
still
serve
as
mottoes
our
forefathers
inhabitants
of
the
island
of
great
britain
left
their
native
land
to
seek
on
these
shores
a
residence
for
civil
and
religious
freedom
our
attachment
to
no
nation
upon
earth
should
supplant
our
attachment
to
liberty
other
passages
of
his
which
were
omitted
contained
strong
and
vivid
phrases
to
ward
these
deadly
injuries
from
the
tender
plant
of
liberty
which
we
have
brought
over
and
with
so
much
affection
fostered
on
these
our
own
shores
we
have
pursued
every
temperate
every
respectful
measure
we
have
supplicated
our
king
at
various
times
in
terms
almost
disgraceful
to
freedom
to
preserve
that
liberty
which
he
our
creator
committed
to
us
in
sacred
deposit
jefferson
avowed
the
hope
that
civil
war
might
be
averted
but
his
more
conciliatory
colleague
was
also
more
boastful
it
was
dickinson
not
he
who
said
our
cause
is
just
our
union
is
perfect
our
preparations
are
nearly
completed
our
internal
resources
are
great
and
our
assurance
of
foreign
assistance
is
certain
despite
the
fact
that
dickinson
watered
down
jefferson
s
draft
of
the
declaration
upon
taking
up
arms
the
more
resolute
patriots
regarded
it
as
a
spirited
manifesto
and
it
proved
to
be
generally
popular
a
second
humble
petition
to
the
king
which
that
delegate
drew
and
which
was
adopted
practically
without
amendment
out
of
deference
to
him
was
viewed
differently
by
jefferson
in
connection
with
this
he
reported
a
sally
of
wit
from
his
corpulent
colleague
harrison
which
was
less
than
just
to
dickinson
the
latter
expressed
his
delight
by
saying
there
is
but
one
word
in
the
paper
mr
president
of
which
i
disapprove
and
that
is
the
word
congress
then
harrison
ponderously
arose
and
said
there
is
but
one
word
in
the
paper
mr
president
of
which
i
approve
and
that
is
the
word
congress
it
should
be
noted
that
this
word
appeared
only
once
but
it
may
be
added
that
george
iii
did
not
deign
to
reply
to
the
petition
despite
its
tone
the
reply
to
lord
north
s
conciliatory
motion
which
jefferson
drew
soon
thereafter
was
more
vigorous
the
committee
itself
was
strong
consisting
of
franklin
john
adams
and
richard
henry
lee
along
with
jefferson
and
because
of
his
association
with
the
reply
of
the
house
of
burgesses
to
the
same
proposal
he
was
the
natural
drafts
man
one
paragraph
was
inserted
at
the
suggestion
of
the
sagacious
franklin
but
the
paper
as
a
whole
followed
the
line
of
argument
that
had
already
been
used
in
the
more
polite
paper
of
the
burgesses
it
was
an
ad
hoc
document
without
the
quality
of
immortality
but
there
was
power
in
its
phrases
a
proposition
to
give
our
money
accompanied
with
large
fleets
and
armies
seems
addressed
to
our
fears
rather
than
to
our
freedom
we
do
not
mean
that
our
people
shall
be
burthened
with
oppressive
taxes
to
provide
sinecures
for
the
idle
or
the
wicked
under
color
of
providing
for
a
civil
list
while
parliament
pursue
their
plan
of
civil
government
within
their
own
jurisdiction
we
also
hope
to
pursue
ours
without
molestation
we
are
of
opinion
that
the
proposition
is
altogether
unsatisfactory
because
it
imports
only
a
suspension
of
the
mode
not
a
renunciation
of
the
pretended
right
to
tax
us
he
spoke
of
indiscriminate
legislation
and
a
high
breach
of
colonial
privilege
described
the
proposition
as
unreasonable
and
insidious
and
stated
boldly
that
nothing
but
our
own
exertions
may
defeat
the
ministerial
sentence
of
death
or
abject
submission
he
labored
under
no
illusions
about
the
probable
effect
of
these
various
congressional
papers
on
the
british
government
soon
after
he
arrived
in
philadelphia
he
wrote
his
brother
in
law
francis
eppes
that
war
was
now
heartily
entered
into
without
a
prospect
of
accommodation
but
through
the
effectual
interposition
of
arms
to
forthright
john
adams
these
petitions
and
addresses
seemed
like
children
s
play
at
marbles
or
push
pin
though
he
afterwards
confessed
that
he
had
underestimated
their
value
i
was
in
great
error
no
doubt
for
these
things
were
necessary
to
give
popularity
to
our
cause
both
at
home
and
abroad
and
to
show
my
stupidity
in
a
stronger
light
the
reputation
of
any
one
of
those
compositions
has
been
a
more
splendid
distinction
than
any
aristocratic
al
star
or
garter
in
the
escutcheon
of
every
man
who
has
enjoyed
it
jefferson
hoped
that
a
vigorous
military
campaign
would
force
the
enemy
to
negotiate
but
it
was
in
connection
with
the
war
of
words
that
he
rendered
his
chief
contribution
and
gained
his
chief
renown
he
was
not
yet
the
penman
laureate
of
the
revolution
indeed
he
was
not
crowned
by
public
opinion
until
these
fateful
years
were
viewed
retrospectively
but
by
the
summer
of
he
had
clearly
demonstrated
his
rare
skill
in
what
came
to
be
known
generations
later
as
psychological
warfare
he
had
relatively
little
to
do
with
the
military
proceedings
of
congress
which
led
to
the
actions
of
greatest
immediate
importance
though
he
followed
the
course
of
external
events
with
deep
interest
it
was
the
necessity
of
putting
military
affairs
in
good
train
which
caused
the
delegates
to
remain
in
tedious
session
when
some
of
them
believed
that
they
had
been
too
long
together
and
all
were
possessed
with
an
impatience
for
home
jefferson
s
stay
in
the
hot
city
was
relatively
brief
but
like
everybody
else
he
welcomed
the
recess
he
started
south
on
august
though
he
was
unable
to
go
straight
to
his
mountaintop
first
he
had
to
attend
another
virginia
convention
in
richmond
it
had
assembled
two
weeks
earlier
and
charles
lewis
of
albemarle
was
sitting
in
his
place
to
all
practical
purposes
this
body
ruled
the
province
in
addition
it
passed
certain
military
measures
to
which
dunmore
would
not
have
consented
it
elected
officers
to
command
three
regiments
of
militia
patrick
henry
who
had
become
a
symbol
of
bold
action
was
chosen
first
and
was
designated
as
commander
in
chief
peyton
randolph
was
again
available
for
congress
but
henry
like
washington
was
regarded
as
ineligible
and
pendleton
asked
to
be
excused
on
grounds
of
health
the
vote
was
as
follows
peyton
randolph
benjamin
harrison
richard
henry
lee
thomas
nelson
jr
thomas
jefferson
richard
bland
george
wythe
when
bland
asked
to
be
relieved
on
account
of
the
infirmities
of
age
patrick
henry
with
jefferson
and
colonel
carrington
headed
a
strong
party
to
elect
george
mason
but
for
personal
reasons
that
learned
man
begged
off
recommending
francis
lightfoot
lee
who
was
elected
the
dominant
attitude
toward
public
service
at
the
time
was
reflected
in
the
argument
which
jefferson
and
others
advanced
to
him
namely
that
one
could
not
refuse
to
obey
the
orders
of
his
country
whatever
these
might
be
election
to
office
in
virginia
was
regarded
more
as
a
call
to
duty
than
as
a
political
reward
and
the
prevailing
practice
was
to
re
elect
men
whose
labors
had
been
acceptable
it
would
not
be
proper
to
rank
the
leaders
in
the
colony
by
the
vote
for
delegates
in
which
jefferson
stood
third
from
other
evidence
it
is
clear
that
half
a
dozen
others
were
more
prominent
than
he
unquestionably
however
he
was
now
regarded
as
a
proved
public
servant
he
spent
only
a
week
at
the
convention
but
he
found
time
to
attend
to
one
bit
of
unfinished
personal
business
before
he
set
out
for
home
he
delivered
to
carter
braxton
an
order
for
in
favor
of
the
attorney
general
john
randolph
this
constituted
the
purchase
price
for
the
latter
s
fine
violin
and
by
paying
it
jefferson
dissolved
the
bargain
they
had
made
more
than
four
years
before
unlike
his
brother
peyton
and
his
own
son
edmund
john
randolph
could
not
go
along
with
the
patriots
and
now
that
the
line
had
been
sharply
drawn
he
purposed
to
remove
to
england
leaving
behind
him
the
instrument
he
had
expected
to
keep
till
death
the
first
fruits
of
victory
were
jefferson
s
but
it
is
doubtful
if
he
felt
triumphant
soon
after
his
return
to
monticello
he
wrote
to
his
old
friend
i
now
send
the
bearer
for
the
violin
such
music
appertaining
to
her
as
may
be
of
no
use
to
the
young
ladies
i
believe
you
had
no
case
for
her
if
so
be
so
good
as
to
direct
watt
lenox
to
get
from
prentis
s
some
bags
or
other
coarse
woolen
to
wrap
her
in
and
then
pack
her
securely
in
a
wooden
box
randolph
delivered
over
the
cherished
instrument
thus
completing
a
highly
interesting
transaction
meanwhile
the
younger
violinist
had
dearly
revealed
his
personal
attitude
toward
the
public
issue
in
his
private
letter
i
hope
said
jefferson
the
returning
wisdom
of
great
britain
will
ere
long
put
an
end
to
this
unnatural
contest
there
may
be
people
to
whose
tempers
and
dispositions
contention
is
pleasing
and
who
therefore
wish
a
continuance
of
confusion
but
to
me
it
is
of
all
states
but
one
the
most
horrid
my
first
wish
is
a
restoration
of
our
just
rights
my
second
a
return
to
the
happy
period
when
consistently
with
duty
i
may
withdraw
myself
totally
from
the
public
stage
and
pass
the
rest
of
my
days
in
domestic
ease
and
tranquillity
banishing
every
desire
of
ever
hearing
what
passes
in
the
world
he
urged
randolph
to
inform
the
british
ministry
of
the
true
state
of
colonial
opponent
handout
while
claiming
that
he
still
favored
conciliation
expressed
the
belief
that
the
americans
would
demand
better
terms
now
that
blood
had
been
spent
i
wish
no
false
sense
of
honor
no
ignorance
of
our
real
intention
st
no
vain
hope
that
partial
concessions
of
right
will
be
accepted
may
induce
the
ministry
to
trifle
with
accommodation
till
it
shall
be
out
of
their
power
ever
to
accommodate
i
am
sincerely
one
of
those
who
wish
for
reunion
and
would
rather
be
in
dependence
on
great
britain
properly
limited
than
on
any
other
nation
on
earth
or
than
on
no
nation
but
i
am
one
of
those
too
who
rather
than
submit
to
the
rights
of
legislating
for
us
assumed
by
the
british
parliament
and
which
late
experience
has
shown
they
will
so
cruelly
exorcist
would
lend
my
hand
to
sink
the
whole
island
in
the
ocean
whether
britain
shall
continue
the
head
of
the
greatest
empire
on
athwart
or
shall
return
to
her
original
station
in
the
political
scale
of
airport
depends
perhaps
on
the
resolutions
of
the
succeeding
winter
god
send
they
may
be
wise
and
salutary
for
us
all
john
randolph
contented
himself
with
expressing
a
strong
desire
for
the
continuation
of
personal
friendship
we
both
of
us
seem
to
be
steering
opposite
course
st
he
said
the
success
of
either
lies
in
the
womb
of
time
jefferson
had
a
respite
of
about
a
month
from
public
duties
during
that
time
occurred
the
death
of
his
second
daughter
jane
randolph
who
had
lived
less
than
a
year
and
a
half
altogether
but
he
has
left
only
a
bare
record
of
the
event
he
picked
up
some
of
the
threads
of
plantation
life
at
monticello
and
in
late
september
he
was
commissioned
by
the
committee
of
safety
as
county
lieutenant
and
commander
of
the
militia
of
albemarle
but
the
colonel
was
unable
to
do
much
service
at
home
just
then
he
had
to
set
out
again
for
philadelphia
he
went
by
orange
courthouse
and
culpeper
this
time
remaining
longer
within
sight
of
the
mountains
and
he
made
a
quicker
trip
than
his
previous
one
from
williamsburg
he
took
at
least
one
slave
along
a
boy
named
bob
whom
he
had
dr
shippen
inoculate
before
he
returned
he
returned
to
his
old
lodgings
with
benjamin
randolph
but
now
shared
the
place
with
other
delegates
and
engaged
with
them
in
common
stock
housekeeping
these
included
peyton
randolph
whose
wife
was
with
him
and
jefferson
s
old
friend
thomas
nelson
garnet
another
fat
marionette
though
alert
and
lively
for
his
weight
and
there
may
have
been
others
the
old
speaker
had
not
displaced
john
hancock
as
presiding
officer
in
the
state
house
and
he
did
not
linger
long
jefferson
was
with
him
in
the
october
evening
when
he
died
of
apoplexy
at
a
house
outside
of
the
city
whither
he
had
gone
to
dine
the
remains
were
removed
to
christ
church
from
benjamin
randolph
s
and
jefferson
undoubtedly
attended
the
elaborate
funeral
services
with
the
other
members
of
congress
wearing
crape
around
his
arm
he
was
kept
busy
attending
the
sessions
in
the
state
house
which
lasted
all
dart
though
they
did
not
accomplish
much
the
expeditions
of
montgomery
and
arnold
to
canada
provided
the
most
exciting
news
when
he
learned
of
the
capture
of
montreal
he
jubilantly
declared
that
the
success
of
american
arms
corresponded
with
the
justice
of
the
colonial
careerist
and
he
added
an
optimistic
prophecy
in
a
short
teammate
we
have
reason
to
ho
pet
the
delegates
of
canada
will
join
us
in
congress
and
complete
the
american
anoint
as
far
as
we
wish
to
have
it
completed
it
will
be
recalled
that
they
did
not
the
delegates
as
a
rule
were
too
optimistic
but
in
the
fall
of
they
generally
recognized
that
the
prospects
of
a
peaceful
settlement
were
remote
in
the
second
week
after
jefferson
s
arrival
one
of
them
wrote
in
one
word
all
hopes
of
speedy
reconciliation
are
given
overt
and
we
unanimously
determine
to
push
the
war
with
the
greatest
vigour
soon
thereafter
they
learned
that
the
king
had
proclaimed
the
colonies
in
a
state
of
rebellion
and
had
threatened
dire
punishment
to
traitors
this
proclamation
called
for
a
strong
answer
and
jefferson
might
well
have
been
asked
to
draft
it
but
actually
he
was
not
virginia
was
represented
on
the
committee
by
richard
henry
lariat
who
spoke
much
better
than
he
wrote
but
with
him
were
two
men
who
were
regarded
as
good
penmen
james
wilson
and
william
livingston
as
jefferson
read
their
report
he
must
have
noted
that
congress
as
a
body
had
caught
up
with
his
thinking
in
some
respects
but
not
in
all
what
allegiance
is
it
that
we
forget
allegiance
to
parliament
we
never
owed
we
never
owned
it
he
had
said
that
more
than
a
year
before
unquestionably
he
approved
of
this
statement
to
support
our
laws
and
our
liberties
established
by
our
laws
we
have
prepared
ordered
and
levied
war
but
he
would
not
have
contented
himself
with
invoking
the
british
constitution
he
would
have
mentioned
the
higher
law
of
nature
also
if
left
to
his
own
devices
he
would
have
spoken
more
sharply
about
george
iii
he
did
just
that
on
the
very
day
that
this
report
was
laid
open
to
the
members
ostensibly
he
set
out
to
inform
his
loyalist
friend
john
randolph
of
the
death
of
the
latter
s
brother
peyton
which
had
occurred
six
weeks
before
but
he
seized
the
occasion
to
speak
his
mind
about
the
king
whom
he
now
described
as
an
immense
misfortune
to
the
entire
empire
we
are
told
he
said
and
everything
proves
it
true
that
he
is
the
bitterest
enemy
we
have
to
undo
his
empire
he
has
but
one
truth
more
to
learn
that
after
colonies
have
drawn
the
sword
there
is
but
one
step
more
they
can
take
that
step
is
now
pressed
upon
us
by
the
measures
adopted
as
if
they
were
afraid
we
would
not
take
it
he
himself
would
hate
to
take
it
but
he
left
no
doubt
of
his
resolution
believe
me
dear
sir
there
is
not
in
the
british
empire
a
man
who
more
cordially
loves
a
union
with
great
britain
than
i
do
but
by
the
god
that
made
me
i
will
cease
to
exist
before
i
yield
to
a
connection
on
such
terms
as
the
british
parliament
propose
and
in
this
i
think
i
speak
the
sentiments
of
america
he
did
not
say
that
secession
from
the
empire
was
inevitable
but
unquestionably
he
thought
that
it
was
becoming
so
we
want
neither
inducement
nor
power
to
declare
and
assert
a
separation
it
is
will
alone
that
is
wanting
and
that
is
growing
apace
under
the
fostering
hand
of
our
icing
one
bloody
campaign
will
probably
decide
everlastingly
our
future
course
and
i
am
sorry
to
find
a
bloody
campaign
is
decided
on
in
the
meantime
there
was
little
that
he
could
do
except
perform
routine
tasks
on
committees
he
served
on
half
a
dozen
in
one
period
of
two
weeks
in
december
but
no
single
assignment
of
his
in
the
entire
session
turned
out
to
be
important
and
several
of
his
reports
were
left
languishing
on
the
table
the
most
spirited
of
his
proposals
came
to
nothing
having
been
informed
that
ethan
allen
the
hero
of
ticonderoga
had
been
captured
near
montreal
jefferson
drafted
an
impassioned
protest
against
his
being
taken
in
irons
to
england
to
be
punished
for
pretended
treason
he
threatened
retaliation
to
stop
the
progress
of
butchery
and
to
compel
the
enemy
to
respect
the
rights
of
nations
but
milder
counsels
prevailed
among
the
delegates
who
merely
instructed
washington
to
seek
an
exchange
jefferson
s
opinions
about
british
unscrupulousness
were
now
deep
seated
but
the
important
thing
to
note
here
is
that
his
own
normal
mildness
of
manner
completely
vanished
when
he
was
speaking
or
writing
especially
when
he
was
writing
about
cruelty
and
what
he
regarded
as
injustice
when
aroused
this
man
who
loathed
contention
could
become
passionate
indeed
toward
the
end
of
december
he
left
congress
for
monticello
no
recess
had
been
ordered
but
the
free
movement
of
the
members
was
characteristic
of
this
body
since
a
colony
had
only
one
vote
regardless
of
the
number
of
its
delegates
not
all
of
them
needed
always
to
be
there
jefferson
had
ample
reason
to
believe
that
virginia
would
be
adequately
represented
in
his
absence
throughout
the
fall
he
had
been
in
an
anxious
state
of
mind
about
his
family
he
had
set
aside
one
day
in
each
week
or
the
larger
part
of
it
for
writing
letters
but
he
did
not
receive
the
ones
he
wanted
in
the
middle
of
the
session
he
still
had
no
word
whatever
about
his
wife
and
daughter
the
suspense
under
which
i
am
is
too
terrible
to
be
endured
he
wrote
his
brother
in
law
if
anything
has
happened
for
god
s
sake
let
me
know
patty
and
little
patsy
were
not
then
at
monticello
but
were
visiting
francis
and
elizabeth
eppes
at
the
forest
they
were
in
the
best
of
hands
but
his
fears
about
his
wife
s
health
had
started
also
there
were
many
things
he
wanted
to
do
at
monticello
it
was
high
time
that
he
went
home
fortune
was
with
him
when
he
returned
to
congress
then
there
was
something
of
real
importance
for
him
to
do
xvi
herald
of
freedom
in
virginia
lord
dunmore
ushered
in
the
year
by
bombarding
norfolk
jefferson
was
on
the
homeward
road
by
that
time
but
before
he
left
philadelphia
he
knew
that
war
had
actually
begun
in
his
own
province
and
like
practically
everybody
else
he
placed
the
responsibility
squarely
on
the
shoulders
of
the
governor
that
dour
scot
after
flitting
from
one
ship
to
another
had
issued
an
emancipation
proclamation
from
the
william
early
in
november
it
was
not
destined
to
rank
with
lincoln
s
despite
the
fact
that
he
retained
only
the
shadow
of
authority
he
had
declared
martial
law
and
he
had
summoned
the
slaves
to
revolt
and
join
his
banner
there
was
some
fighting
in
the
coastal
country
but
he
did
not
have
enough
troops
to
make
much
of
a
showing
he
attracted
some
runaway
slaves
and
encouraged
a
few
loyalists
but
he
served
chiefly
to
infuriate
the
virginians
and
to
drive
them
along
the
road
to
independence
luckily
jefferson
and
his
family
were
remote
from
the
scene
of
dunmore
s
activities
and
he
reflected
that
only
such
places
as
lay
on
the
water
s
edge
were
actually
endangered
john
page
was
much
concerned
about
his
house
in
the
tidewater
county
of
gloucester
but
monticello
was
still
a
haven
of
peace
and
the
contemporary
records
of
its
master
reflect
little
consciousness
of
a
state
of
war
as
county
lieutenant
he
had
duties
to
perform
and
it
may
have
been
at
this
time
that
he
carefully
listed
the
volunteers
from
albemarle
but
he
also
broached
a
pipe
of
madeira
of
the
vintage
of
began
to
stock
his
park
with
deer
and
welcomed
to
his
stable
another
foal
of
the
proud
line
of
fearnought
for
four
months
he
lived
as
a
country
gentleman
in
virtual
retirement
he
was
quite
prepared
to
resume
his
public
duties
as
soon
as
he
was
really
needed
but
he
welcomed
the
opportunity
to
put
his
thoughts
in
order
and
to
remain
with
his
wife
about
whom
he
continued
to
be
troubled
he
was
urged
by
his
friend
nelson
who
had
his
own
lady
with
him
in
philadelphia
to
bring
her
with
him
but
she
was
in
no
con
derision
to
go
it
would
have
been
unlike
him
to
give
any
further
explanation
but
the
chances
are
that
she
carried
other
children
than
those
who
finally
appeared
upon
the
record
and
that
there
were
mishaps
which
went
unmentioned
jefferson
had
no
special
reason
to
be
alarmed
about
his
mother
then
living
at
shadwell
but
on
the
last
day
of
march
she
suffered
what
was
supposed
to
be
an
apoplectic
stroke
lingered
for
an
hour
and
died
in
her
fifty
seventh
year
he
left
only
a
bald
and
unemotional
record
of
the
event
partly
through
accident
it
may
be
but
also
because
of
his
consistent
reticence
in
all
personal
matters
this
was
just
about
the
date
that
he
had
expected
to
return
to
congress
but
in
the
meantime
he
himself
fell
ill
and
was
incapacitated
for
some
five
weeks
longer
the
report
got
around
that
he
was
suffering
from
an
inveterate
headache
which
had
a
hard
name
probably
it
was
what
we
now
call
migraine
by
early
may
he
was
over
it
and
in
the
fullness
of
time
he
descended
from
the
mountain
he
would
have
preferred
to
go
to
williamsburg
where
the
last
and
most
noted
of
the
revolutionary
conventions
of
virginia
was
assembling
but
duty
called
him
to
philadelphia
and
he
was
ready
accompanied
by
his
servant
bob
he
went
again
by
the
upland
route
carrying
with
him
funds
he
had
collected
for
the
purchase
of
powder
for
virginia
and
for
the
relief
of
the
poor
in
boston
and
after
a
week
s
journey
he
arrived
at
his
old
lodgings
eight
days
later
he
removed
to
a
new
brick
house
three
stories
high
on
the
southwest
corner
of
market
and
seventh
streets
this
belonged
to
a
bricklayer
by
the
name
of
graff
spelled
graaf
by
him
then
newly
married
jefferson
s
quarters
on
the
second
floor
consisted
of
a
bedroom
and
parlor
which
had
the
stairs
between
them
he
did
his
writing
in
the
parlor
and
commonly
used
a
folding
writing
box
which
his
former
landlord
the
cabinetmaker
benjamin
randolph
had
made
from
jefferson
s
own
drawing
he
still
had
it
half
a
century
later
it
claims
no
merit
of
particular
beauty
he
then
said
it
is
plain
neat
convenient
and
taking
no
more
room
on
the
writing
table
than
a
moderate
quarto
volume
it
yet
displays
itself
sufficiently
for
any
writing
on
this
box
and
in
this
brick
house
he
drafted
the
declaration
of
independence
the
period
of
debate
was
over
as
thomas
paine
had
said
while
jefferson
was
still
at
monticello
he
received
from
nelson
in
philadelphia
a
present
of
worth
of
common
sense
and
thus
became
acquainted
with
paine
s
catalytic
pamphlet
furthermore
he
went
to
great
pains
to
sound
out
local
sentiment
before
he
left
home
and
became
convinced
that
nine
tenths
of
the
people
in
the
upper
counties
favored
independence
in
philadelphia
he
found
awaiting
him
a
month
old
letter
from
john
page
in
which
this
friend
exhorted
him
for
god
s
sake
declare
the
colonies
independent
and
save
us
from
ruin
also
he
had
one
of
the
same
date
from
another
old
college
mate
who
said
the
notion
of
independency
seems
to
spread
fast
in
this
colony
and
will
be
adopted
i
dare
say
by
a
majority
of
the
next
convention
but
jefferson
was
only
a
delegate
to
congress
and
he
had
to
await
specific
instructions
from
his
country
on
may
the
gentlemen
in
williamsburg
instructed
their
delegates
to
propose
to
congress
that
the
united
colonies
be
declared
free
and
independent
states
twelve
days
later
these
delegates
presented
their
instructions
while
the
resolution
lay
on
the
table
in
the
state
house
in
philadelphia
the
people
in
williamsburg
generally
assumed
that
virginia
had
already
declared
her
independence
ardent
patriots
hoisted
a
new
flag
that
of
the
continental
union
over
the
capitol
and
the
convention
proceeded
to
create
a
new
government
on
june
it
adopted
a
constitution
and
there
could
then
be
no
possible
doubt
that
the
virginians
had
severed
their
imperial
bonds
and
embarked
on
an
independent
course
whether
the
states
preceded
the
union
or
the
union
preceded
the
states
is
as
futile
a
question
as
that
about
the
hen
and
the
egg
but
the
historic
primacy
of
the
oldest
and
strongest
of
the
colonies
in
the
cause
of
freedom
was
generally
and
generously
recognized
thus
within
a
few
weeks
this
apostrophe
appeared
in
print
and
now
when
britain
s
mercenary
bands
bombard
our
cities
desolate
our
lands
our
pray
rs
unanswer
d
and
our
tears
in
vain
while
foreign
cut
throats

th
ensanguin
d

thy
glowing
virtue
caught
the
glorious
flame
and
first
renounc
d
the
cruel
tyrant
s
name
with
just
disdain
and
most
becoming
pride
further
dependence
on
the
crown
deny
d
whilst
freedom
s
voice
can
in
these
wilds
be
heard
virginia
s
patriots
shall
be
still
rever
d
during
the
months
of
may
and
june
one
of
virginia
s
patriots
was
feeling
a
little
sorry
for
himself
in
philadelphia
jefferson
had
begun
immediately
to
serve
on
committees
and
these
filled
up
a
good
deal
of
time
during
this
period
he
dealt
particularly
with
the
affairs
of
canada
drafting
several
reports
and
referring
frequently
in
letters
to
the
misfortunes
the
american
expedition
had
suffered
he
was
much
more
interested
in
the
affairs
of
virginia
however
and
he
made
more
important
use
of
his
new
writing
box
in
drafting
a
constitution
for
his
own
commonwealth
this
document
which
he
sent
to
the
convention
by
george
wythe
about
the
middle
of
june
will
be
considered
later
the
main
thing
to
be
said
here
is
that
jefferson
sent
with
it
a
list
of
charges
against
king
george
iii
which
the
convention
attached
to
its
new
constitution
as
a
preamble
his
fellow
planters
did
not
follow
the
precise
wording
in
which
he
declared
the
king
deposed
but
they
did
declare
that
because
of
the
acts
of
misrule
enumerated
by
jefferson
the
government
of
their
country
as
formerly
exercised
under
the
crown
of
great
britain
was
totally
dissolved
thus
they
joined
with
him
in
setting
the
backdrop
for
a
more
famous
action
one
of
his
specific
recommendations
to
his
own
countrymen
ought
also
to
be
mentioned
here
he
proposed
that
such
colonies
as
should
be
established
in
virginia
s
domain
west
of
the
mountains
should
be
free
and
independent
of
this
colony
and
of
all
the
world
he
did
not
intend
them
to
be
subordinate
at
this
early
date
he
advocated
the
policy
which
was
afterwards
embodied
in
legislative
acts
of
original
states
and
in
ordinances
of
congress
and
which
permitted
the
historic
expansion
of
the
american
republic
through
the
creation
of
new
states
equal
in
all
respects
to
the
old
his
prophetic
finger
pointed
to
the
enlarged
union
of
the
future
in
philadelphia
the
pace
was
slower
than
in
williamsburg
but
the
tempo
was
quickening
with
customary
care
the
denouncer
of
george
iii
and
the
prophet
of
an
expanding
confederation
made
certain
notes
on
proceedings
these
he
incorporated
long
years
later
in
his
autobiography
with
a
glow
of
satisfaction
in
congress
friday
june
the
delegates
from
virginia
moved
in
obedience
to
instructions
from
their
constituents
that
the
congress
should
declare
that
these
united
colonies
are
of
right
ought
to
be
free
independent
states
that
they
are
absolved
from
all
allegiance
to
the
british
crown
and
that
all
political
connection
between
them
the
state
of
great
britain
is
ought
to
be
totally
dissolved
this
was
the
first
of
the
famous
resolutions
presented
for
the
delegation
by
richard
henry
lee
jefferson
did
not
participate
in
the
debate
on
the
floor
that
took
place
a
couple
of
days
later
though
he
noted
the
arguments
in
the
course
of
this
debate
it
appeared
to
him
and
others
that
the
middle
colonies
and
south
carolina
were
not
yet
matured
for
falling
from
the
parent
stem
but
that
they
were
fast
advancing
to
that
state
it
accordingly
it
was
decided
to
postpone
the
final
decision
until
july
and
to
appoint
a
committee
in
the
meantime
to
prepare
a
declaration
this
consisted
of
jefferson
john
adams
franklin
roger
sherman
and
robert
r
livingston
since
richard
henry
lee
had
presented
the
resolution
for
independence
in
the
first
place
there
has
been
much
speculation
about
his
failure
to
be
appointed
to
the
committee
instead
of
jefferson
if
this
was
because
of
his
unpopularity
within
the
virginia
delegation
and
the
desire
to
build
jefferson
up
against
him
as
john
adams
said
there
was
no
sign
of
any
alienation
of
the
two
men
at
the
time
two
or
three
days
after
the
committee
was
named
lee
set
out
for
virginia
to
see
his
ailing
wife
and
to
attend
the
convention
in
williamsburg
as
apparently
he
had
intended
doing
all
along
there
is
more
reason
to
suppose
that
jefferson
envied
lee
this
opportunity
than
that
lee
envied
jefferson
to
both
of
them
the
proceedings
in
williamsburg
seemed
more
vital
at
the
moment
than
the
drafting
of
a
document
in
philadelphia
this
particular
document
they
undoubtedly
regarded
as
important
but
nobody
then
knew
it
would
turn
out
to
be
immortal
it
might
not
have
been
if
lee
had
drawn
it
at
all
events
it
was
inevitable
that
a
virginian
should
be
appointed
to
the
committee
and
despite
his
youth
jefferson
was
a
natural
choice
his
voice
was
uncertain
but
his
pen
was
known
to
be
potent
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
his
mind
was
prepared
presumably
the
five
members
met
at
the
house
on
the
bristol
pike
where
franklin
was
confined
with
the
gout
and
discussed
the
general
form
of
the
declaration
then
jefferson
was
asked
to
draft
it
whether
or
not
he
and
adams
were
appointed
to
a
subcommittee
as
the
latter
said
and
he
himself
denied
is
unimportant
and
even
if
the
conversation
between
the
two
men
did
not
occur
precisely
as
adams
reported
it
long
afterwards
the
reasons
which
he
then
assigned
were
valid
it
was
the
part
of
wisdom
to
assign
the
lead
to
a
virginian
for
the
middle
colonies
were
lukewarm
and
the
new
englanders
were
deliberately
keeping
themselves
in
the
background
at
this
stage
also
jefferson
bore
no
such
odium
of
mistrust
and
unpopularity
as
adams
attributed
to
himself
and
he
was
doubtless
regarded
as
the
better
writer
however
he
appears
to
have
submitted
his
draft
first
to
adams
and
then
to
the
ailing
franklin
and
an
early
copy
of
it
in
the
handwriting
of
the
forthright
delegate
from
massachusetts
survives
as
a
priceless
document
in
the
seventeen
days
between
june
when
the
committee
was
appointed
and
june
when
they
reported
to
congress
jefferson
made
his
draft
he
consulted
no
book
or
pamphlet
though
he
felt
entirely
free
to
do
so
and
had
no
desire
to
be
original
the
purposes
which
he
had
in
mind
he
afterwards
stated
with
unexcelled
frankness
and
clarity
not
to
find
out
new
principles
or
new
arguments
never
before
thought
of
not
merely
to
say
things
which
had
never
been
said
before
but
to
place
before
mankind
the
common
sense
of
the
subject
in
terms
so
plain
and
firm
as
to
command
their
assent
and
to
justify
ourselves
in
the
independent
stand
we
are
compelled
to
take
neither
aiming
at
adulatory
of
principle
or
sentiment
nor
yet
copied
from
any
particular
and
previous
writing
it
was
intended
to
be
an
expression
of
the
american
mind
and
to
give
to
that
expression
the
proper
tone
and
spirit
called
for
by
the
occasion
he
did
copy
a
good
deal
from
a
particular
and
previous
writing
of
his
own
beside
his
writing
box
he
spread
out
the
charges
against
the
king
which
he
had
sent
to
virginia
these
constituted
the
substantial
foundation
of
the
longest
section
in
the
declaration
another
paper
which
his
fellow
virginians
adopted
before
their
constitution
was
also
available
to
him
the
declaration
of
rights
largely
drafted
by
george
mason
and
afterwards
renowned
the
phraseology
of
the
even
more
famous
philosophical
paragraph
in
the
inter
colonial
declaration
is
similar
to
parts
of
this
and
may
reflect
its
direct
influence
jefferson
could
have
drawn
on
george
mason
for
his
own
statement
of
fundamental
human
rights
and
he
would
have
thought
this
not
amiss
but
the
ideas
were
in
his
mind
already
they
belonged
to
no
single
man
but
in
his
opinion
were
the
property
of
mankind
certainly
they
were
the
property
of
the
american
patriots
whose
mind
he
was
trying
to
express
and
it
really
made
no
difference
where
they
came
from
jefferson
s
task
was
to
impart
the
proper
tone
and
spirit
and
to
do
this
he
labored
long
he
was
a
ready
writer
but
he
could
also
be
a
fastidious
one
and
he
never
weighed
his
phrases
more
carefully
than
now
he
even
corrected
the
paper
after
it
was
formally
adopted
in
order
to
get
a
better
word
he
regarded
capitalization
and
spelling
with
considerable
indifference
in
letters
but
here
he
went
to
unusual
pains
to
regularize
them
the
history
of
the
evolving
text
of
the
declaration
has
been
studied
by
scholars
with
great
care
in
the
effort
to
determine
the
authorship
of
every
phrase
and
to
distribute
credit
with
impartial
hand
certain
minor
changes
can
be
credited
to
adams
and
franklin
the
authorship
of
others
which
jefferson
inserted
at
a
later
time
in
his
rough
draft
will
probably
remain
forever
doubtful
in
the
first
place
he
wrote
we
hold
these
truths
to
be
sacred
and
undeniable
we
cannot
be
sure
whether
it
was
he
or
franklin
who
substituted
self
evident
it
is
possible
that
the
expression
unalienable
rights
was
owing
to
a
printer
s
error
for
jefferson
himself
wrote
inalienable
the
changes
have
been
counted
and
recounted
but
the
ones
made
by
his
colleagues
on
the
committee
appear
to
have
been
few
and
the
document
they
approved
and
reported
on
june
was
undeniably
jefferson
s
then
it
ran
the
gamut
of
congress
to
his
own
deep
chagrin
but
with
results
that
were
generally
beneficial
congress
properly
kept
it
on
the
table
for
a
few
days
for
they
still
had
to
reach
a
decision
on
the
question
of
independence
itself
it
was
on
july
that
this
question
which
john
adams
described
as
the
greatest
that
ever
was
debated
in
america
was
decided
the
resolution
originally
presented
by
richard
henry
lee
was
then
adopted
and
the
delegates
as
a
group
were
free
to
consider
the
precise
form
of
the
declaration
they
examined
it
during
the
three
days
july
jefferson
dutifully
observed
the
proprieties
by
listening
in
silence
while
less
partial
judges
commented
on
the
merits
and
demerits
of
his
work
john
adams
loyally
supported
every
word
of
it
however
and
benjamin
franklin
told
him
a
comforting
story
while
he
writhed
this
was
about
a
hatter
whose
inscription
for
a
handsome
sign
board
was
subjected
to
such
criticism
that
it
was
finally
reduced
to
his
name
and
the
figure
of
a
hat
jefferson
and
some
of
his
virginia
friends
believed
that
congress
weakened
the
declaration
but
there
can
now
be
little
doubt
that
the
critics
strengthened
it
this
they
did
primarily
by
deletion
the
most
important
single
omission
was
the
perfervid
charge
against
the
king
about
the
slave
trade
in
simpler
form
this
had
been
accepted
by
jefferson
s
fellow
virginians
who
had
included
it
in
the
preamble
to
their
constitution
just
as
he
wrote
it
even
though
they
did
not
then
outlaw
the
slave
trade
as
he
desired
in
congress
the
south
carolinians
and
georgians
favored
the
continuance
of
the
traffic
and
certain
of
the
northern
brethren
were
dubious
about
such
sweeping
condemnation
being
aware
that
some
of
their
people
had
engaged
in
the
dirty
business
others
besides
george
iii
were
blameable
from
the
literary
point
of
view
this
omission
was
no
loss
for
the
charge
was
really
out
of
character
with
the
rest
of
the
document
it
was
one
of
those
rare
jeffersonian
passages
which
are
consciously
rhetorical
and
betray
a
striving
for
effect
also
congress
rewrote
and
greatly
reduced
the
final
paragraph
attaching
to
it
not
jefferson
s
assertion
of
independence
but
the
original
resolution
of
lee
these
changes
contributed
to
directness
and
thus
constituted
an
improvement
but
from
jefferson
s
rough
draft
certain
touching
expressions
may
be
resurrected
and
allowed
to
speak
for
themselves
such
for
example
as
these
we
must
endeavor
to
forget
our
former
love
for
them
we
might
have
been
a
free
and
a
great
people
together
plenty
of
felicitous
phrases
were
left
more
probably
than
in
any
other
of
jefferson
s
compositions
and
quite
enough
for
any
single
document
in
the
last
sentence
congress
inserted
the
phrase
with
a
firm
reliance
on
the
protection
of
divine
providence
but
left
his
final
words
in
their
original
form
except
for
capitalization
we
mutually
pledge
to
each
other
our
lives
our
fortunes
and
our
sacred
honour
they
could
not
improve
on
these
the
literary
excellence
of
the
declaration
is
best
attested
by
the
fact
that
it
has
stood
the
test
of
time
it
became
the
most
popular
state
paper
of
the
american
republic
not
merely
because
it
was
the
first
but
also
because
to
most
people
it
has
seemed
the
best
no
other
american
document
has
been
read
so
often
or
listened
to
by
so
many
weary
and
perspiring
audiences
yet
despite
interminable
repetition
those
well
worn
phrases
have
never
lost
their
potency
and
charm
so
far
as
form
is
concerned
the
continuing
appeal
of
the
declaration
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
is
clear
and
simple
and
that
for
all
its
careful
craftsmanship
and
consummate
grace
it
was
not
so
highly
polished
as
to
lose
its
edge
only
in
its
reiterated
charges
against
the
king
does
it
even
approach
the
declamatory
it
may
lack
the
stark
grandeur
of
certain
passages
from
lincoln
it
may
be
almost
too
felicitous
but
it
has
notable
elevation
of
spirit
and
solemnity
of
tone
intended
as
an
expression
of
the
american
mind
it
was
also
jefferson
at
his
literary
best
its
immediate
purpose
was
to
justify
the
secession
of
the
colonies
from
the
mother
country
thus
as
every
american
should
know
the
great
document
begins
when
in
the
course
of
human
events
it
becomes
necessary
for
one
people
to
dissolve
the
political
bands
which
have
connected
them
with
another
and
to
assume
among
the
powers
of
the
earth
the
separate
and
equal
station
to
which
the
laws
of
nature
and
of
nature
s
god
entitle
them
a
decent
respect
to
the
opinions
of
mankind
requires
that
they
should
declare
the
causes
which
impel
them
to
the
separation
it
is
hard
to
see
how
jefferson
could
have
combined
in
such
compass
a
larger
number
of
important
ideas
or
could
have
better
imparted
the
tone
of
dignity
solemnity
respectful
firmness
and
injured
virtue
which
the
circumstances
required
it
was
necessary
to
dissolve
these
old
political
bands
the
american
people
were
entitled
to
an
independent
station
under
the
laws
of
god
and
nature
but
they
had
a
decent
respect
to
the
opinions
of
mankind
and
were
thus
impelled
to
give
reasons
for
their
course
before
stating
the
specific
reasons
he
took
the
whole
controversy
out
of
the
realm
of
petty
and
selfish
squabbling
by
setting
it
on
a
high
background
of
philosophy
the
philosophical
passage
in
the
declaration
which
he
wrote
as
a
single
brief
paragraph
became
the
most
famous
part
of
the
document
and
as
a
summary
of
human
rights
and
a
justification
of
revolution
in
behalf
of
them
it
is
doubtful
if
it
has
ever
been
excelled
actually
he
outlined
a
whole
system
of
philosophy
in
a
few
sentences
to
this
epitome
of
current
wisdom
which
he
himself
regarded
as
a
creed
we
must
turn
again
as
men
have
done
through
the
generations
at
the
time
however
attention
was
focused
on
the
specific
rather
than
on
the
general
grounds
of
revolution
for
these
were
familiar
to
others
besides
enlightened
gentlemen
and
the
statement
of
them
awakened
echoes
in
more
minds
the
charges
in
the
declaration
were
directed
not
against
the
british
people
or
the
british
parliament
but
against
the
king
there
was
definite
purpose
in
this
jefferson
and
the
great
body
of
the
patriots
with
him
had
already
repudiated
the
authority
of
parliament
and
in
his
summary
view
he
had
made
a
futile
appeal
to
the
monarch
now
this
last
tie
was
to
be
cut
and
the
onus
must
be
put
on
george
iii
himself
such
a
personification
of
grievances
was
unwarranted
on
strict
historical
grounds
this
was
the
language
of
political
controversy
not
that
of
dispassionate
scholarship
nevertheless
in
these
charges
jefferson
gave
an
extraordinarily
full
summary
of
the
whole
controversy
with
the
mother
country
he
included
the
major
grievances
against
parliament
by
a
clever
literary
device
which
avoided
even
the
mention
of
that
name
he
the
king
has
combined
with
others
to
subject
us
to
a
jurisdiction
foreign
to
our
constitution
and
unacknowledged
by
our
laws
giving
his
assent
to
their
acts
of
pretended
legislation
certain
acts
of
pretended
legislation
were
then
specified
at
the
bar
of
history
these
charges
now
seem
extreme
almost
any
modern
historian
can
make
a
better
case
for
the
british
authorities
than
jefferson
did
for
he
really
granted
them
no
case
at
all
this
is
not
to
say
that
he
made
any
charge
which
could
not
have
been
backed
by
facts
these
grievances
were
actual
not
imaginary
they
recalled
in
every
instance
specific
policies
and
events
they
constituted
a
long
train
of
abuses
and
certain
of
them
could
properly
be
termed
usurpations
but
historians
of
a
later
generation
who
have
been
in
position
to
study
this
controversy
calmly
assign
most
of
them
to
official
stupidity
or
to
helplessness
in
the
face
of
the
larger
imperial
problem
rather
than
to
a
deliberate
design
to
reduce
the
colonies
under
absolute
despotism
by
implication
certain
of
these
charges
were
manifestly
unjust
the
causes
of
the
american
revolution
cannot
be
adduced
from
the
declaration
alone
and
jefferson
may
be
charged
with
over
simplifying
an
exceedingly
complicated
situation
this
would
have
been
a
fault
in
an
historian
but
under
the
circumstances
it
may
be
regarded
as
a
virtue
in
a
statesman
he
carried
this
over
simplification
even
further
in
another
paper
which
was
written
five
years
later
and
has
remained
obscure
in
an
address
to
an
indian
chief
toward
the
end
of
his
governorship
of
virginia
he
described
the
causes
of
the
revolution
as
a
teacher
might
to
a
child
you
find
us
brother
engaged
in
war
with
a
powerful
nation
our
forefathers
were
englishmen
inhabitants
of
a
little
island
beyond
the
great
water
and
being
distressed
for
land
they
came
and
settled
here
as
long
as
we
were
young
and
weak
the
english
whom
we
had
left
behind
made
us
carry
all
our
wealth
to
their
country
to
enrich
them
and
not
satisfied
with
this
they
at
length
began
to
say
we
were
their
slaves
and
should
do
whatever
they
ordered
us
we
were
now
grown
up
and
felt
ourselves
strong
we
knew
we
were
free
as
they
were
that
we
came
here
of
our
own
accord
and
not
at
their
biddance
and
were
determined
to
be
free
as
long
as
we
should
exist
for
this
reason
they
made
war
on
us
this
sounds
much
too
simple
but
jefferson
s
failure
to
allow
for
the
complexities
of
the
imperial
problem
and
to
grant
any
credit
to
british
good
will
cannot
be
attributed
to
the
fact
that
he
had
a
simple
mind
or
conspicuously
lacked
a
sense
of
historical
justice
the
relativity
of
circumstances
must
always
be
remembered
on
the
verge
of
revolution
jefferson
and
his
colleagues
could
not
be
expected
to
be
dispassionate
he
had
long
since
weighed
the
conflicting
arguments
and
the
preponderance
on
the
patriots
side
seemed
so
great
that
he
saw
no
need
for
apothecary
s
scales
he
was
wandering
in
no
mist
of
doubt
seeking
the
totality
of
truth
his
task
as
a
statesman
was
to
grasp
the
essence
of
the
controversy
and
as
the
penman
of
independence
to
set
it
forth
not
in
neutral
shades
but
in
bold
contrasts
of
black
and
white
to
his
mind
the
fundamental
issue
was
simple
british
policy
constituted
a
perilous
threat
to
liberties
that
were
dearer
to
him
than
life
itself
furthermore
he
was
convinced
that
british
policy
centered
in
the
personality
and
was
inseparable
from
the
determination
of
a
stubborn
king
to
him
george
iii
was
not
merely
a
symbol
but
a
powerful
personal
obstacle
to
the
sort
of
self
government
he
and
his
fellows
were
claiming
as
a
natural
human
right
in
his
own
mind
he
coupled
the
monarch
with
ill
fated
charles
i
that
year
jefferson
heard
from
benjamin
franklin
a
motto
which
he
attributed
to
one
of
the
regicides
rebellion
to
tyrants
is
obedience
to
god
he
seized
upon
this
immediately
put
it
on
his
own
seal
later
and
made
it
a
personal
slogan
throughout
life
in
especially
this
was
a
stirring
call
to
action
for
the
historical
circumstances
seemed
to
him
strikingly
analogous
to
those
that
had
led
to
the
successful
revolt
against
the
stuart
king
jefferson
was
not
a
complete
historian
and
if
a
philosopher
is
one
who
can
never
quite
make
up
his
mind
he
was
no
philosopher
if
passionate
devotion
to
causes
one
deems
fundamental
is
partisanship
he
was
very
generally
a
partisan
and
certainly
was
one
at
this
stage
but
at
no
time
afterwards
did
he
ever
doubt
that
his
general
estimate
of
this
situation
was
correct
he
did
not
change
his
opinion
about
george
iii
when
he
met
him
ten
years
later
but
considering
the
declaration
toward
the
end
of
his
own
life
he
himself
valued
the
principles
of
the
instrument
more
than
his
wholesale
indictment
of
british
policy
at
the
age
of
thirty
three
such
also
has
been
the
judgment
of
history
it
is
not
for
the
charges
against
the
king
but
for
the
brief
philosophical
paragraph
that
posterity
has
been
most
grateful
to
him
said
abraham
lincoln
when
the
author
of
the
declaration
had
been
dead
for
a
generation
all
honor
to
jefferson
to
the
man
who
in
the
concrete
pressure
of
a
struggle
for
national
independence
by
a
single
people
had
the
coolness
forecaste
sic
and
sagacity
to
introduce
into
a
merely
revolutionary
document
an
abstract
truth
applicable
to
all
men
and
all
times
and
so
to
embalm
it
there
that
to
day
and
in
all
coming
days
it
shall
be
a
rebuke
and
a
stumbling
block
to
the
very
harbingers
of
reappearing
tyranny
and
oppression
these
words
from
lincoln
could
have
been
echoed
with
eminent
appropriateness
during
the
latest
and
greatest
of
wars
for
the
doctrines
of
the
declaration
stand
in
complete
antithesis
to
those
which
the
totalitarians
of
the
twentieth
century
proclaimed
jefferson
s
words
should
make
tyranny
tremble
in
any
age
they
have
alarmed
conservative
minds
in
his
own
land
in
every
generation
and
some
compatriots
of
his
have
regretted
that
the
new
republic
was
dedicated
to
such
radical
doctrines
at
its
birth
whether
it
would
have
been
thus
dedicated
amid
such
incense
of
universalism
if
jefferson
had
not
officiated
at
the
altar
no
man
can
say
at
the
dawn
of
american
independence
congress
made
his
words
official
and
held
these
truths
to
be
self
evident
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
unalienable
rights
that
among
these
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
that
to
secure
these
rights
governments
are
instituted
among
men
deriving
their
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
the
immediate
deduction
was
the
light
of
revolution
against
a
government
which
was
destructive
of
these
ends
another
deduction
was
inescapable
the
governments
to
be
established
here
must
aim
first
of
all
to
secure
these
rights
american
democracy
might
have
developed
as
the
resultant
of
other
forces
geographical
and
economic
but
the
fact
is
that
this
passage
became
its
major
charter
the
history
of
american
democracy
as
has
been
wisely
said
is
a
gradual
realization
too
slow
for
some
and
too
rapid
for
others
of
the
implications
of
the
declaration
of
independence
it
will
require
a
long
book
to
show
in
convincing
detail
what
jefferson
himself
sought
to
realize
how
he
tried
to
do
it
how
he
both
succeeded
and
failed
but
two
important
questions
of
implication
should
be
raised
here
one
is
about
property
which
he
did
not
mention
in
this
famous
passage
the
other
is
about
the
natural
equality
of
men
which
he
proclaimed
was
there
any
significance
in
his
omission
of
the
word
property
which
had
been
used
by
john
locke
and
his
substitution
for
it
of
the
phrase
pursuit
of
happiness
it
is
exceedingly
doubtful
that
his
contemporaries
thought
there
was
locke
presupposed
the
pursuit
of
happiness
and
jefferson
always
assumed
as
basic
the
right
of
an
individual
to
hold
property
he
did
not
anticipate
communism
nevertheless
his
use
here
of
a
more
inclusive
phrase
than
the
word
property
was
probably
deliberate
and
if
it
does
not
clearly
indicate
a
philosophical
distinction
between
different
sorts
of
rights
it
does
suggest
the
characteristic
shading
of
his
thought
from
his
later
statements
and
actions
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
such
rights
as
freedom
of
mind
conscience
and
person
were
the
ones
he
cherished
most
these
unquestionably
were
inalienable
and
also
desirable
in
themselves
property
was
indispensable
just
as
government
was
but
like
it
was
a
means
to
human
happiness
and
not
an
end
other
expressions
then
seemed
much
more
significant
at
the
virginia
convention
shortly
before
this
during
the
discussion
of
george
mason
s
declaration
of
rights
certain
aristocrats
objected
to
the
statement
that
men
are
by
nature
equally
free
and
independent
as
being
the
forerunner
or
pretext
of
civil
convulsion
the
revolutionary
character
of
the
doctrine
was
recognized
the
objectors
were
calmed
down
however
by
the
observation
that
this
was
mostly
talk
and
that
the
generalization
did
not
apply
to
slaves
at
any
rate
if
jefferson
had
been
present
and
had
been
questioned
on
this
point
he
would
have
said
that
the
general
statement
did
apply
to
slaves
and
that
these
unfortunate
creatures
had
lost
their
freedom
and
all
semblance
of
equality
through
the
operation
of
human
law
which
in
this
respect
was
in
conflict
with
the
higher
law
of
nature
his
own
recommendations
to
that
convention
do
not
reveal
him
as
an
impatient
reformer
and
in
reality
he
never
became
one
but
they
leave
no
doubt
that
he
took
his
own
philosophy
seriously
slavery
in
his
native
region
was
one
of
the
contradictions
he
always
had
to
face
it
was
one
of
the
tyrannical
forms
he
was
unable
to
abolish
the
natural
equality
he
talked
about
was
not
that
of
intellectual
endowment
but
as
lincoln
so
clearly
perceived
he
proclaimed
for
all
time
the
dignity
of
human
nature
at
a
crucial
moment
in
congress
was
under
the
control
of
men
who
were
willing
to
adopt
under
the
pressure
of
imperial
circumstances
what
amounted
to
a
charter
of
individual
liberty
and
human
rights
and
to
inscribe
it
indelibly
on
the
page
of
history
this
was
translated
into
democratic
terms
as
soon
as
men
began
to
employ
them
widely
thus
a
sensitive
and
fastidious
gentleman
who
prized
privacy
and
disliked
the
rabble
became
a
major
prophet
not
only
of
freedom
but
also
of
democracy
he
himself
was
slower
to
use
the
latter
term
than
to
realize
the
implications
of
his
doctrine
and
his
actions
at
this
time
were
not
motivated
by
personal
political
ambition
nor
had
he
proceeded
in
a
mood
of
sentimentality
he
felt
with
his
mind
and
his
mind
left
him
in
no
doubt
that
what
he
had
said
was
right
on
july
this
thoughtful
and
observant
man
arose
at
dawn
according
to
his
custom
noting
in
the
back
of
his
account
book
that
the
temperature
was
fahrenheit
at
a
m
on
his
way
to
or
from
the
state
house
that
very
day
he
paid
for
a
thermometer
but
undoubtedly
he
had
used
this
or
another
one
already
his
record
of
the
temperature
from
this
time
forward
wherever
he
happened
to
be
was
practically
unbroken
he
never
ceased
being
interested
in
climate
though
he
believed
that
likes
and
dislikes
in
this
respect
were
largely
a
matter
of
habit
to
one
of
his
upbringing
this
day
must
have
been
quite
comfortable
his
highest
reading
of
the
thermometer
was
at
one
o
clock
his
thoughts
were
not
wholly
of
the
place
and
season
however
for
on
that
day
he
also
paid
for
seven
pairs
of
women
s
gloves
destined
for
monticello
on
july
at
oxford
where
lord
north
was
chancellor
honorary
degrees
were
conferred
by
that
ancient
and
honorable
university
on
thomas
hutchinson
late
governor
of
massachusetts
bay
and
peter
oliver
late
deputy
governor
in
england
they
could
not
be
expected
to
know
just
what
was
happening
in
congress
and
not
even
the
delegates
in
philadelphia
thought
of
this
as
the
birthday
of
the
american
republic
the
great
decision
was
made
on
july
when
the
resolution
of
independence
was
adopted
what
actually
happened
on
july
was
that
twelve
states
agreed
to
the
written
declaration
embodying
this
resolution
while
the
delegates
from
new
york
refrained
from
voting
the
action
did
not
become
unanimous
until
july
when
the
resolutions
of
the
new
york
convention
were
laid
before
congress
in
the
meantime
the
declaration
was
authenticated
by
the
bold
signature
of
president
john
hancock
and
by
that
of
secretary
charles
thomson
it
was
printed
and
transmitted
to
the
various
assemblies
conventions
committees
and
commanding
officers
and
on
july
in
philadelphia
it
was
first
proclaimed
by
the
local
committee
of
safety
john
adams
has
left
a
brief
account
of
this
event
which
occurred
in
the
state
house
yard
in
the
presence
of
a
great
crowd
of
people
jefferson
must
have
been
present
but
he
was
not
in
the
spotlight
nobody
announced
that
he
was
the
author
of
this
paper
or
led
him
forward
upon
the
stage
to
take
a
bow
cheers
mounted
to
the
sky
battalions
paraded
on
the
common
and
the
bells
rang
all
day
and
most
of
the
night
this
was
in
celebration
not
of
a
document
but
of
an
event
the
tie
with
the
mother
country
had
been
cut
and
congress
as
a
body
was
responsible
for
that
dangerous
and
fateful
action
not
until
july
did
congress
order
that
the
declaration
be
engrossed
on
parchment
and
signed
by
the
members
jefferson
himself
could
not
have
affixed
his
own
name
until
august
the
names
of
the
delegates
were
well
known
but
the
signatures
themselves
were
not
made
public
until
the
following
january
and
jefferson
s
was
one
of
many
even
then
this
is
another
way
of
saying
that
his
chief
fame
from
the
declaration
lay
in
the
future
as
he
poked
around
the
shops
of
philadelphia
bystanders
may
have
pointed
him
out
as
an
influential
delegate
but
they
did
not
hail
him
as
the
author
and
he
probably
would
not
have
wanted
them
to
at
the
moment
in
fact
his
pride
in
authorship
was
slight
for
he
believed
that
congress
had
manhandled
his
composition
and
marred
its
strength
he
cared
little
for
general
applause
but
he
wanted
to
guard
his
own
literary
reputation
among
the
select
he
made
copies
of
his
own
draft
as
it
had
emerged
from
the
committee
and
sent
these
to
some
of
his
friends
they
could
compare
it
with
the
final
version
and
judge
whether
it
was
better
or
worse
for
the
critics
richard
henry
lee
who
was
entitled
to
a
copy
on
other
grounds
believed
that
the
critics
had
mangled
the
paper
and
most
of
jefferson
s
friends
in
virginia
sent
comments
which
were
gratifying
to
him
personally
pendleton
thought
the
charges
against
the
king
an
improvement
over
those
in
the
preamble
to
the
virginia
constitution
and
john
page
was
highly
pleased
with
the
declaration
as
a
whole
but
these
friends
did
not
differentiate
sharply
between
the
act
of
asserting
independence
and
the
document
in
the
case
thus
lee
said
that
the
thing
itself
that
is
independence
was
so
good
that
no
cookery
could
spoil
the
dish
for
the
palates
of
freemen
nobody
regarded
the
paper
as
in
any
sense
a
private
affair
and
page
s
prayer
was
the
natural
and
proper
one
god
preserve
the
united
states
nobody
except
jefferson
himself
took
his
wounded
pride
as
an
author
very
seriously
and
he
proceeded
to
dismiss
the
paper
from
his
mind
he
kept
his
contemporary
record
of
events
but
not
until
later
did
he
put
them
in
their
present
form
and
by
that
time
his
memory
was
confused
because
of
an
ambiguous
statement
in
what
passed
for
the
official
record
he
like
nearly
everybody
else
forgot
the
exact
date
at
which
he
affixed
his
signature
as
an
old
man
he
talked
much
about
such
antiquarian
matters
because
they
were
so
often
referred
to
him
but
in
july
the
most
important
fact
was
that
independence
had
been
reclaimed
in
the
name
of
the
officers
of
the
continental
congress
this
was
political
revolution
and
it
brought
grave
dangers
in
its
train
jefferson
did
not
forget
however
that
in
a
moment
of
high
faith
he
had
formulated
a
creed
for
himself
and
the
republic
his
dominant
concern
henceforth
was
to
translate
this
into
legal
institutions
and
to
make
it
a
living
reality
during
the
next
three
years
in
virginia
he
devoted
himself
more
impressively
to
this
task
than
to
the
more
immediate
one
of
winning
the
war
and
the
equally
imperative
one
of
establishing
a
more
perfect
union
liberalizing
a
commonwealth
xvii
framing
a
government
jefferson
remained
in
congress
from
the
middle
of
may
until
the
beginning
of
september
and
his
devotion
to
the
general
american
cause
did
not
slacken
but
his
heart
was
always
in
virginia
he
had
hardly
arrived
in
philadelphia
before
he
expressed
the
hope
that
he
might
be
recalled
for
a
time
to
attend
the
convention
in
williamsburg
this
was
not
primarily
because
the
fateful
question
of
independence
would
be
raised
there
he
could
anticipate
what
the
answer
to
that
would
be
and
as
things
turned
out
his
presence
would
not
have
affected
the
decision
what
he
wanted
was
a
share
in
framing
the
new
government
of
his
commonwealth
it
is
a
work
of
the
most
interesting
nature
and
such
as
every
individual
would
wish
to
have
his
voice
in
he
wrote
to
his
friend
nelson
who
was
back
in
virginia
at
the
time
in
truth
it
is
the
whole
object
of
the
present
contrasts
for
should
a
bad
government
be
instituted
for
us
in
future
it
had
been
as
well
to
have
accepted
at
first
the
bad
one
offered
us
from
beyond
the
water
without
the
risk
and
expense
of
contest
obviously
he
was
not
one
of
those
who
would
rest
content
with
freeing
the
province
from
external
control
he
regarded
political
independence
not
as
an
end
but
as
a
means
and
was
more
deeply
concerned
about
what
should
follow
the
formal
separation
than
about
the
action
itself
furthermore
what
he
said
and
did
about
the
constitution
of
virginia
made
it
abundantly
clear
that
he
was
no
mere
purveyor
of
philosophical
generalities
but
a
man
of
practical
purpose
who
was
formulating
a
definite
program
at
the
outset
he
questioned
the
right
of
the
convention
to
create
a
permanent
constitution
believing
that
such
a
document
should
be
the
work
of
deputies
specially
elected
for
that
purpose
and
thus
be
based
more
indubitably
on
the
popular
will
his
objections
which
were
presented
by
edmund
randolph
in
his
absence
were
overborne
on
practical
as
well
as
theoretical
grounds
and
there
would
have
been
no
point
in
his
pressing
them
further
at
this
juncture
but
the
fact
that
he
raised
them
again
afterwards
showed
that
he
was
very
serious
about
them
and
anyone
who
looked
behind
the
scenes
could
see
that
he
was
already
a
more
thoroughgoing
champion
of
popular
government
than
edmund
pendleton
or
george
mason
or
patrick
henry
the
draft
of
a
constitution
that
jefferson
made
before
the
middle
of
june
and
sent
to
the
convention
by
george
wythe
was
not
considered
as
a
whole
for
the
ostensible
reason
that
it
arrived
too
late
to
wythe
himself
this
seemed
a
sufficient
explanation
the
weather
in
williamsburg
was
hot
the
delegates
were
tired
and
a
draft
for
which
george
mason
was
chiefly
responsible
had
been
accepted
by
the
committee
and
presented
on
the
floor
the
only
feasible
procedure
with
regard
to
jefferson
s
draft
seemed
to
be
to
draw
upon
it
for
purposes
of
amendment
that
the
delegates
were
willing
to
do
this
and
to
adopt
his
preamble
containing
charges
against
the
king
practically
as
he
had
written
it
was
all
he
could
have
reasonably
expected
what
the
result
would
have
been
if
he
had
been
able
to
throw
his
plan
into
the
hopper
at
the
beginning
and
to
urge
it
in
person
is
a
matter
of
sheer
speculation
the
fact
is
that
george
mason
not
he
became
the
major
architect
of
the
new
government
and
that
he
was
not
satisfied
with
the
results
the
differences
between
his
draft
and
that
of
the
committee
did
not
seem
great
at
first
glance
and
a
first
glance
was
all
that
most
of
the
delegates
gave
to
jefferson
s
document
but
some
of
these
differences
were
important
the
convention
adopted
a
declaration
of
rights
before
it
did
a
constitution
thus
establishing
a
theoretical
foundation
in
advance
jefferson
himself
soon
did
much
the
same
thing
by
placing
the
philosophical
section
at
the
beginning
of
the
declaration
of
independence
his
countrymen
who
had
expressed
the
rights
of
men
as
human
beings
and
not
merely
as
englishmen
had
made
history
the
virginia
declaration
of
rights
often
incorrectly
called
the
bill
of
rights
exercised
great
influence
both
at
home
and
abroad
and
was
regarded
in
later
years
as
an
epoch
making
document
said
lafayette
the
era
of
the
american
revolution
which
one
can
regard
as
the
beginning
of
a
new
social
order
for
the
entire
world
is
properly
speaking
the
era
of
declarations
of
rights
jefferson
was
always
proud
that
the
first
notable
american
paper
of
the
sort
emanated
from
his
own
commonwealth
certain
of
its
articles
did
not
go
quite
as
far
as
he
desired
for
example
freedom
of
religion
was
only
vaguely
described
in
it
whereas
in
his
proposed
constitution
he
included
freedom
from
the
requirement
to
frequent
or
maintain
any
religious
institution
he
already
favored
the
disestablishment
of
the
church
and
he
soon
drew
a
better
statement
of
the
ideal
of
religious
freedom
as
far
as
it
went
however
he
thought
the
declaration
of
rights
admirable
and
he
regarded
its
chief
author
george
mason
as
a
sincere
republican
and
a
man
of
the
first
order
of
wisdom
in
jefferson
s
opinion
the
new
commonwealth
had
the
first
requirement
of
a
good
government
it
was
based
on
a
sound
doctrine
of
human
rights
the
next
question
was
just
how
the
declaration
of
rights
was
to
be
interpreted
and
applied
the
immediate
answer
was
given
in
the
constitution
that
was
adopted
and
the
machinery
that
was
actually
set
up
the
convention
was
dominated
by
moderate
men
not
radicals
and
they
had
no
desire
to
usher
in
a
political
and
social
revolution
the
plantation
aristocrats
had
led
the
revolt
against
great
britain
with
some
dissent
on
the
part
of
extreme
conservatives
and
having
brought
about
this
break
they
sought
to
maintain
their
own
political
and
economic
position
they
were
willing
to
do
lip
service
to
human
rights
and
as
a
group
they
were
humane
men
but
most
of
them
would
probably
have
been
content
to
restore
local
conditions
as
they
had
existed
before
when
the
british
government
changed
its
policy
jefferson
himself
was
no
wild
radical
in
practice
but
he
looked
forward
not
backward
and
was
more
determined
than
the
other
leaders
to
carry
his
ideas
about
human
rights
to
their
logical
conclusion
this
determination
was
not
strikingly
manifest
in
the
proposals
about
the
structure
of
the
state
government
that
he
included
in
his
draft
of
a
constitution
for
these
were
almost
if
not
quite
as
conservative
as
the
ones
actually
adopted
referring
to
the
entire
era
of
the
american
revolution
he
afterwards
said
in
truth
the
abuses
of
monarchy
had
so
much
filled
all
the
space
of
political
contemplation
that
we
imagined
everything
republican
which
was
not
monarchy
we
had
not
yet
penetrated
to
the
mother
principle
that
governments
are
republican
only
in
proportion
as
they
embody
the
will
of
the
people
and
execute
it
hence
our
first
constitutions
had
really
no
leading
principles
in
them
the
course
of
development
was
natural
enough
and
really
called
for
no
apology
like
the
other
state
governments
established
in
this
period
that
of
virginia
grew
directly
from
the
one
that
already
existed
and
he
himself
had
no
strong
inclination
to
fly
in
the
face
of
experience
at
the
time
what
his
countrymen
actually
did
was
to
substitute
for
the
royal
governor
one
who
was
elected
by
the
assembly
and
in
the
reaction
against
executive
authority
largely
to
shear
him
of
power
the
same
sort
of
thing
soon
happened
in
other
provinces
and
jefferson
may
have
been
adjudged
conservative
in
wanting
to
grant
to
the
governor
a
larger
share
of
the
appointive
power
the
other
major
existing
agencies
were
continued
in
slightly
different
form
the
old
governor
s
council
had
served
in
both
an
executive
and
legislative
capacity
the
convention
accordingly
provided
for
an
executive
council
of
state
chosen
by
the
assembly
and
an
upper
legislative
house
elected
by
the
people
which
following
jefferson
s
suggestion
they
called
the
senate
he
himself
had
no
objection
to
a
long
term
for
senators
the
assembly
selected
the
judges
as
well
as
the
governor
and
the
net
result
was
that
it
dominated
the
government
jefferson
did
not
intend
to
go
quite
that
far
for
he
wanted
the
governor
whom
he
called
the
administrator
to
appoint
many
of
the
judges
and
he
favored
a
higher
degree
of
executive
and
judicial
independence
in
his
plan
the
legislative
control
centered
less
in
the
assembly
as
a
whole
than
in
the
more
representative
lower
house
to
which
he
assigned
the
election
of
both
the
governor
and
the
senate
the
degree
in
which
the
new
government
was
democratic
or
representative
depended
less
on
its
external
form
than
on
the
provisions
for
the
election
of
the
members
of
the
legislature
it
was
in
connection
with
the
basis
rather
than
the
structure
of
the
government
that
jefferson
showed
himself
to
be
more
forward
looking
than
any
of
the
other
contemporary
leaders
and
an
outstanding
advocate
of
popular
rule
on
the
basis
of
just
representation
he
did
not
advocate
the
abandonment
of
property
qualifications
for
voting
but
he
favored
extending
the
suffrage
to
freeholders
possessing
a
quarter
of
an
acre
in
town
or
twenty
five
acres
in
the
country
and
coupled
with
this
the
proposal
that
fifty
acres
of
land
be
granted
to
every
person
of
full
age
who
did
not
already
have
that
many
under
existing
conditions
the
result
would
have
been
practically
universal
white
male
suffrage
also
he
would
have
forbidden
the
granting
of
free
land
to
others
thus
he
sought
to
extend
economic
opportunity
and
to
lessen
special
privilege
furthermore
he
recommended
that
representation
be
based
on
the
distribution
of
voters
that
is
practically
on
the
population
and
not
on
the
county
unit
system
which
was
continued
his
desire
to
bring
about
a
more
equitable
system
of
representation
may
be
explained
in
part
by
his
residence
in
the
growing
piedmont
region
which
was
discriminated
against
but
it
was
rooted
in
the
conviction
that
the
over
represented
tidewater
was
the
seat
of
privilege
and
unjust
power
jefferson
took
little
pride
in
his
proposals
to
this
convention
for
these
afterwards
seemed
conservative
and
he
doubted
if
he
himself
had
penetrated
to
the
true
republican
principle
at
the
time
but
no
other
leader
in
virginia
then
went
so
far
as
he
in
the
advocacy
of
popular
representative
government
until
the
eve
of
the
civil
war
the
constitutional
struggles
in
the
commonwealth
centered
in
the
questions
of
the
suffrage
and
the
basis
of
representation
and
at
the
very
outset
he
ranged
himself
on
the
democratic
side
also
he
proposed
that
the
importation
of
slaves
should
cease
and
he
saw
no
place
for
an
established
church
in
a
free
society
george
wythe
said
the
system
that
was
set
up
in
jefferson
s
absence
required
reformation
and
that
he
was
the
man
who
must
effect
it
what
was
established
was
in
reality
an
aristocratic
republic
bottomed
on
inheritance
it
is
true
that
patrick
henry
the
popular
idol
who
was
still
regarded
as
an
upstart
by
some
of
the
wealthiest
planters
was
elected
governor
but
the
ruling
group
as
a
whole
viewed
him
without
alarm
to
say
that
he
had
been
a
radical
in
imperial
relations
would
be
to
beg
the
question
his
personal
power
lay
chiefly
in
the
realm
of
the
emotions
and
although
he
had
a
keen
sense
of
public
opinion
he
had
no
domestic
program
worthy
of
the
name
furthermore
he
was
indolent
by
nature
and
during
the
year
his
health
was
bad
his
physical
incapacity
threw
an
added
burden
on
john
page
who
received
the
highest
vote
for
the
council
of
state
and
became
its
president
the
latter
could
be
counted
on
to
remain
an
agreeable
gentleman
while
dealing
with
vexatious
routine
but
unlike
his
friend
jefferson
he
had
not
wholly
emancipated
his
mind
from
his
inherited
privilege
in
domestic
matters
he
must
be
characterized
as
a
conservative
the
supremely
important
legislative
department
had
not
been
organized
as
yet
but
anyone
could
have
predicted
that
edmund
pendleton
who
had
fallen
heir
to
the
position
formerly
occupied
by
peyton
randolph
would
be
elected
speaker
of
the
new
house
of
delegates
when
it
assembled
in
the
fall
no
one
symbolized
better
than
he
the
ruling
group
for
this
delightful
man
and
highly
effective
leader
clung
to
old
ways
and
feared
drastic
change
there
were
others
of
more
liberal
temper
like
george
mason
who
had
been
very
prominent
of
late
and
might
be
induced
to
share
the
public
councils
again
but
if
there
was
to
be
a
reformer
s
role
jefferson
was
much
the
likeliest
candidate
for
it
both
by
inheritance
and
association
he
belonged
to
the
ruling
group
but
he
already
envisaged
a
more
rational
and
progressive
society
and
was
eager
to
move
toward
it
during
the
summer
of
he
was
deeply
concerned
lest
his
influence
in
virginia
would
be
weakened
by
his
absence
in
congress
he
had
been
elected
for
a
term
of
one
year
which
would
expire
in
august
and
by
the
middle
of
june
he
had
concluded
that
he
did
not
care
to
be
re
elected
he
was
already
a
strong
believer
in
the
principle
of
rotation
in
office
anyway
he
expressed
his
personal
wishes
to
his
neighbor
dr
george
gilmer
who
was
acting
in
his
stead
in
williamsburg
and
also
wrote
to
pendleton
the
president
of
the
convention
the
second
letter
had
not
been
received
when
the
ballot
for
delegates
in
congress
took
place
and
gilmer
was
absent
on
that
day
jefferson
s
plea
for
relief
was
presented
by
edmund
randolph
but
the
convention
re
elected
him
nevertheless
he
might
have
viewed
this
disregard
of
his
wishes
as
a
compliment
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
greatly
disturbed
by
the
bald
report
of
the
vote
which
he
got
in
philadelphia
about
july
he
learned
that
the
delegation
had
been
reduced
from
seven
to
five
that
benjamin
harrison
and
carter
braxton
who
were
in
congress
with
him
had
been
dropped
entirely
and
that
his
own
name
stood
next
to
last
on
the
list
he
naturally
presumed
that
the
existing
delegation
had
been
discredited
it
is
a
painful
situation
to
be
miles
from
one
s
country
and
thereby
opened
to
secret
assassination
without
a
possibility
of
self
defence
he
wrote
to
his
friend
william
fleming
i
am
willing
to
hope
nothing
of
this
kind
has
been
done
in
my
case
but
yet
i
cannot
be
easy
afterwards
he
learned
that
the
reduction
in
the
size
of
the
delegation
was
owing
chiefly
to
patrick
henry
and
that
the
political
maneuvers
were
not
directed
against
him
his
friend
fleming
assured
him
that
the
decline
in
his
vote
was
attributable
solely
to
the
report
of
his
letter
to
gilmer
that
otherwise
scarcely
anybody
would
have
voted
against
him
and
that
he
was
as
high
in
the
estimation
of
his
countrymen
as
ever
numerous
stories
had
been
circulated
about
braxton
and
harrison
and
some
may
also
have
been
told
about
jefferson
but
fleming
s
statement
in
regard
to
his
standing
is
convincing
there
was
considerable
intrigue
at
the
convention
but
he
was
definitely
aligned
with
no
faction
he
dwelt
in
the
lofty
realm
of
ideas
and
was
on
the
best
of
personal
terms
with
leaders
of
every
complexion
the
election
of
delegates
to
congress
took
place
before
his
proposed
constitution
for
virginia
had
been
presented
but
that
document
was
probably
not
regarded
by
many
people
as
dangerously
radical
he
had
not
aroused
the
serious
disquietude
of
the
conservatives
he
did
not
want
his
vote
reduced
if
he
was
voted
for
at
all
nobody
would
have
and
he
was
more
sensitive
than
most
men
his
chief
immediate
concern
however
was
to
get
out
of
congress
the
reasons
which
he
gave
to
edmund
pendleton
were
personal
not
political
and
they
were
generally
regarded
as
sufficient
though
no
formal
action
was
taken
on
them
until
the
assembly
met
in
the
fall
this
is
what
he
said
i
am
sorry
the
situation
of
my
domestic
affairs
renders
it
indispensably
necessary
that
i
should
solicit
the
substitution
of
some
other
person
here
in
my
room
the
delicacy
of
the
house
will
not
require
me
to
enter
minutely
into
the
private
causes
which
render
this
necessary
i
trust
they
will
be
satisfied
i
would
not
urge
it
again
were
it
not
unavoidable
i
shall
with
cheerfulness
continue
my
duty
here
till
the
expiration
of
our
year
by
which
time
i
hope
it
will
be
convenient
for
my
successor
to
attend
his
friends
were
in
no
doubt
about
the
private
causes
his
wife
was
staying
with
francis
and
elizabeth
eppes
at
the
forest
until
he
could
return
home
he
did
not
get
as
many
letters
from
that
quarter
as
he
wanted
but
every
one
he
did
get
brought
him
such
an
account
of
her
health
that
he
found
it
painful
to
remain
in
philadelphia
he
had
promised
to
stay
until
august
and
he
actually
stayed
about
three
weeks
longer
the
reason
was
that
neither
braxton
nor
harrison
had
the
legal
right
to
start
another
term
as
he
had
and
they
did
not
hesitate
to
go
home
when
they
wanted
to
he
had
to
wait
until
richard
henry
lee
arrived
for
otherwise
virginia
would
have
been
without
a
quorum
meanwhile
he
was
busy
enough
throughout
his
service
as
a
delegate
he
gave
close
attention
to
queries
and
commissions
which
came
from
his
country
these
included
such
diverse
matters
as
the
supply
of
salt
about
which
he
could
do
little
or
nothing
the
new
state
seal
for
which
he
sent
suggestions
and
the
disputed
boundary
with
pennsylvania
on
which
the
virginia
delegates
vainly
invited
conference
for
congress
he
helped
draw
up
rules
of
procedure
anticipating
in
some
degree
his
important
service
as
a
parliamentarian
twenty
years
later
he
received
and
recorded
numerous
depositions
dealing
with
the
sad
course
of
events
in
canada
and
he
shared
with
his
congenial
colleague
john
adams
the
thankless
task
of
proposing
a
revision
of
the
articles
of
war
most
of
this
was
tedious
business
but
it
was
conscientiously
attended
to
the
collaboration
of
the
famous
trio
of
the
declaration
of
independence
was
continued
in
another
matter
which
had
no
immediate
public
results
but
is
of
considerable
interest
in
itself
on
july
franklin
jefferson
and
adams
were
appointed
as
a
committee
to
bring
in
a
device
for
the
seal
of
the
united
states
and
from
their
deliberations
that
summer
two
historic
mottoes
emerged
the
design
recommended
by
them
in
august
was
by
pierre
eugene
du
simitiere
a
swiss
artist
living
in
philadelphia
from
whom
jefferson
also
procured
a
design
for
virginia
but
all
three
of
the
committeemen
made
suggestions
and
they
approved
a
modified
version
of
franklin
s
for
the
other
side
of
the
seal
of
all
the
states
the
motto
rebellion
to
tyrants
is
obedience
to
god
was
in
franklin
s
proposals
jefferson
liked
it
so
much
that
he
added
it
to
du
simitiere
s
design
for
virginia
and
as
has
already
been
said
adopted
it
at
some
time
himself
stamping
it
on
the
wax
with
which
he
sealed
his
own
letters
he
had
no
doubt
of
the
appropriateness
of
the
saying
at
that
hour
the
over
elaborate
design
of
du
simitiere
which
fortunately
was
not
accepted
by
congress
contained
an
even
more
famous
motto
e
pluribus
unum
and
this
was
adopted
at
a
later
time
it
was
taken
presumably
by
the
artist
from
the
motto
of
the
gentleman
s
magazine
as
used
by
the
london
periodical
during
the
generation
before
the
revolution
it
meant
that
one
magazine
was
made
up
from
many
newspapers
and
the
thought
of
applying
it
to
the
american
federation
of
states
was
an
inspiration
as
a
member
of
the
committee
jefferson
shares
the
credit
of
sponsorship
and
both
mottoes
reflected
his
sentiments
but
at
this
time
and
place
he
and
his
colleagues
were
stressing
rebellion
to
tyrants
more
this
was
a
period
of
unpropitious
military
events
but
jefferson
expected
a
brief
war
shortly
before
the
adoption
of
the
declaration
he
said
that
the
opinion
was
universal
that
the
trial
would
be
severe
only
during
the
next
three
months
from
george
wythe
and
others
he
learned
of
the
movements
of
lord
dunmore
who
was
still
hovering
off
the
virginia
coast
but
he
had
nothing
but
contempt
for
the
governor
and
was
confident
that
the
americans
could
never
be
conquered
though
they
probably
would
have
to
give
up
places
lying
on
the
water
s
edge
he
was
less
hopeful
about
the
working
out
of
an
acceptable
framework
of
government
for
the
federation
which
was
a
far
more
difficult
undertaking
than
framing
the
constitution
of
a
single
state
he
kept
notes
on
part
of
the
debate
on
the
articles
of
confederation
these
dealt
particularly
with
the
crucial
questions
of
quotas
of
contribution
and
the
manner
of
voting
in
congress
it
was
proposed
that
state
contributions
should
be
based
on
population
and
the
question
arose
whether
or
not
slaves
should
be
counted
on
this
issue
northern
delegates
voted
in
the
affirmative
and
southern
in
the
negative
the
latter
being
outvoted
jefferson
did
not
enter
into
the
debate
on
the
other
question
the
clash
was
between
the
large
and
small
states
the
former
favoring
a
vote
based
on
population
and
the
latter
an
equal
voice
for
every
state
in
this
dilemma
jefferson
proposed
a
plan
privately
to
john
adams
and
he
recalled
it
to
the
latter
several
months
later
when
the
confederation
was
again
on
the
carpet
and
the
situation
seemed
desperate
it
was
that
any
proposition
might
be
negatived
by
the
representatives
of
a
majority
of
the
people
of
america
or
by
a
majority
of
the
colonies
of
america
and
he
believed
that
this
plan
would
safeguard
the
interests
of
both
large
states
and
small
at
the
time
however
his
contribution
to
the
cause
of
union
seemed
to
be
negative
for
as
a
spokesman
of
virginia
he
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
his
state
would
not
now
agree
that
the
confederation
should
dispose
of
lands
that
virginia
claimed
it
was
this
question
of
western
lands
more
than
anything
else
which
afterwards
delayed
the
ratification
of
the
articles
of
confederation
and
jefferson
himself
manifested
no
spirit
of
narrow
provincialism
in
later
years
when
he
formulated
policies
of
western
expansion
for
both
of
these
reasons
the
attitude
he
took
in
is
a
matter
of
considerable
historical
interest
the
best
clue
to
it
is
probably
to
be
found
not
in
his
local
patriotism
nor
in
any
abstract
doctrines
of
state
rights
but
in
the
actualities
of
the
land
question
itself
in
his
mind
this
was
not
primarily
a
question
of
rivalry
between
one
state
and
another
for
he
claimed
that
he
was
indifferent
to
that
and
at
a
later
time
the
vast
extent
of
virginia
s
domain
made
it
relatively
easy
for
him
to
be
generous
in
spirit
his
major
concern
was
not
for
the
land
but
for
the
people
who
settled
on
it
and
at
this
time
he
believed
that
the
interests
of
the
pioneers
could
be
better
safeguarded
by
states
than
by
congress
which
seemed
more
susceptible
to
the
pressure
of
speculative
land
companies
he
was
deeply
sympathetic
with
squatters
but
had
little
patience
with
absentee
groups
who
came
seeking
special
favors
what
he
most
relied
on
for
the
protection
of
individuals
was
local
self
government
and
he
was
already
on
record
as
favoring
the
early
development
of
it
in
virginia
s
outlying
lands
but
until
he
could
be
reassured
about
the
attitude
of
congress
toward
the
small
landholders
he
preferred
to
depend
on
the
states
to
protect
them
particularly
on
his
own
state
for
he
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
he
could
be
influential
there
at
this
stage
he
did
not
stand
out
as
specially
local
or
particularistic
almost
all
his
colleagues
were
that
to
a
considerable
degree
he
was
willing
to
concede
much
to
the
cause
of
union
and
if
he
minimized
the
military
dangers
so
did
practically
everybody
else
but
it
was
characteristic
of
him
to
lay
major
stress
on
human
values
and
to
think
in
long
range
terms
he
had
no
doubt
that
in
the
states
not
in
congress
one
could
do
most
for
men
as
men
this
was
the
most
important
public
reason
why
he
himself
was
so
anxious
to
go
home
while
he
waited
impatiently
for
richard
henry
lee
to
arrive
he
discussed
with
wythe
and
pendleton
the
problem
of
developing
the
legal
institutions
of
his
commonwealth
the
latter
suggested
that
he
become
a
judge
and
was
unwilling
to
accept
all
the
reasons
jefferson
assigned
for
declining
pendleton
could
not
assent
to
his
being
considered
unqualified
but
as
he
added
i
readily
do
to
your
usefulness
in
the
representative
body
where
having
the
pleasure
of
mrs
jefferson
s
company
i
hope
you
ll
get
cured
of
your
wish
to
retire
so
early
in
life
from
the
memory
of
man
and
exercise
your
talents
for
the
nurture
of
our
new
constitution
this
was
precisely
what
jefferson
purposed
to
do
he
would
not
withdraw
from
the
public
service
but
he
would
enjoy
his
wife
s
company
he
would
enter
the
house
of
delegates
and
he
would
nurture
the
new
constitution
his
ideas
on
the
latter
subject
however
were
more
advanced
and
more
constructive
than
those
of
pendleton
or
anybody
else
in
late
august
he
wound
up
his
affairs
in
the
quaker
city
he
reimbursed
mrs
nelson
wife
of
his
fellow
delegate
for
sundry
articles
bought
by
her
for
mrs
jefferson
he
settled
accounts
for
his
two
horses
and
bought
guitar
strings
he
purchased
a
hat
for
himself
and
another
for
colonel
thomas
mann
randolph
he
paid
mrs
graff
in
full
for
his
lodgings
on
september
he
left
philadelphia
and
proceeding
by
lancaster
frederick
and
leesburg
he
arrived
six
days
later
at
monticello
about
a
month
after
that
he
received
notice
from
john
hancock
that
he
had
been
appointed
a
commissioner
to
the
court
of
france
to
serve
with
benjamin
franklin
and
silas
deane
under
other
circumstances
he
would
have
been
strongly
tempted
to
accept
this
confidential
appointment
he
had
previously
told
franklin
he
would
like
to
go
with
him
and
franklin
afterwards
very
much
wished
he
had
had
jefferson
s
companionship
instead
of
that
of
his
colleague
arthur
lee
but
as
jefferson
wrote
to
the
president
of
congress
circumstances
peculiar
to
the
situation
of
his
family
compelled
him
to
decline
an
alluring
mission
the
trouble
was
that
he
could
neither
leave
them
behind
nor
take
them
with
him
europe
would
have
to
wait
public
service
could
be
adjusted
to
the
exigencies
of
domestic
life
far
more
easily
in
virginia
than
in
france
or
pennsylvania
when
the
assembly
met
in
october
george
wythe
who
was
now
attending
congress
and
had
his
own
wife
with
him
made
available
to
the
jeffersons
his
house
in
williamsburg
accordingly
the
senior
delegate
from
albemarle
took
his
lady
with
him
to
the
place
which
he
had
so
often
visited
in
student
days
judging
by
the
doctor
s
bills
he
paid
for
her
that
fall
she
was
not
wholly
recovered
but
at
least
she
was
near
him
never
again
during
her
lifetime
did
he
go
so
far
away
as
philadelphia
he
was
not
sacrificing
his
career
on
the
altar
of
domestic
necessity
however
the
local
role
he
had
chosen
was
admirably
suited
to
his
talents
and
in
playing
it
he
performed
some
of
the
most
significant
of
all
his
public
services
xviii
the
way
of
a
legislator
freeing
the
land
the
years
during
which
jefferson
was
a
legislator
in
his
own
commonwealth
comprised
his
most
creative
period
as
a
statesman
during
the
american
revolution
and
there
was
no
part
of
his
entire
career
that
he
afterwards
looked
back
upon
with
greater
satisfaction
the
incomplete
autobiography
he
wrote
in
old
age
is
a
generally
modest
and
unpretentious
document
but
deep
pr
de
shines
through
his
account
of
his
services
to
virginia
during
the
critical
early
years
of
independence
when
as
he
reflected
he
was
striving
to
eradicate
every
fiber
of
aristocracy
and
to
lay
the
foundation
for
a
truly
republican
government
never
were
his
purposes
clearer
nor
his
motives
purer
and
at
no
other
time
perhaps
was
the
essence
of
his
philosophy
and
statesmanship
so
unmistakably
revealed
no
wonder
he
looked
back
on
this
period
with
the
emotions
of
nostalgia
his
own
pride
was
in
his
program
as
a
whole
rather
than
his
immediate
accomplishments
but
some
distinction
must
be
made
between
them
strictly
speaking
his
period
of
legislative
activity
in
the
state
of
virginia
lasted
less
than
three
years
from
the
time
that
he
took
his
seat
in
the
house
of
delegates
in
october
until
he
became
governor
at
the
beginning
of
june
most
of
his
most
important
proposals
were
still
pending
at
the
latter
date
some
of
them
were
afterwards
adopted
through
the
agency
of
other
men
when
he
himself
was
viewing
other
scenes
and
some
of
them
were
never
adopted
at
all
he
was
pre
eminently
a
political
architect
looking
to
the
future
not
a
short
range
reformer
and
the
plans
that
were
still
in
the
blueprint
stage
when
he
left
the
house
of
delegates
have
contributed
far
more
to
his
immortal
renown
than
the
specific
measures
of
his
that
were
adopted
in
the
triennium
this
is
certainly
not
to
say
that
in
the
years
the
deputy
from
albemarle
was
a
prophet
without
honor
in
his
own
commonwealth
a
mere
list
of
the
motions
he
made
the
bills
he
drafted
and
the
committees
he
served
on
in
his
first
session
is
an
index
of
his
prominence
it
would
be
too
much
to
claim
as
often
has
been
claimed
by
his
later
admirers
that
he
dominated
the
legislative
scene
but
unquestionably
he
assumed
a
position
of
great
influence
at
the
outset
and
largely
maintained
it
during
the
sessions
that
followed
this
he
was
able
to
do
because
he
had
effected
in
his
own
person
a
rare
blend
of
the
qualities
of
a
prophet
and
those
of
a
practical
statesman
the
prophetic
role
appears
the
greater
in
the
perspective
of
history
and
his
contemporaries
could
hardly
have
failed
to
glimpse
it
to
them
however
he
also
appeared
and
appeared
much
more
frequently
as
one
who
was
engaged
in
the
humdrum
tasks
of
legislation
to
the
outward
eye
he
was
far
from
being
an
impractical
visionary
he
was
ceaselessly
industrious
and
bore
his
full
share
of
legislative
routine
the
details
of
such
activities
as
drawing
bills
for
the
raising
of
additional
battalions
of
infantry
and
for
changing
the
value
of
copper
coin
and
of
such
services
as
reviewing
the
action
of
a
county
committee
which
had
fined
an
unintentional
violator
of
the
continental
association
need
not
concern
us
here
it
is
important
however
to
note
his
prominence
in
these
day
to
day
affairs
and
his
recognized
leadership
in
matters
of
legislative
prerogative
and
procedure
he
generally
managed
to
steer
clear
of
factional
quarrels
in
which
issues
were
chiefly
personal
the
line
between
progressives
and
conservatives
in
the
virginia
government
frequently
shifted
and
often
was
indistinct
he
was
more
consistently
on
the
progressive
side
than
any
other
prominent
leader
and
in
fundamental
thinking
he
stood
farthest
to
the
left
to
a
notable
degree
nonetheless
he
continued
to
maintain
cordial
personal
relations
with
all
groups
and
to
retain
their
confidence
thus
in
when
it
was
alleged
that
the
conservative
harrison
faction
was
trying
to
legislate
the
more
progressive
richard
henry
lee
out
of
the
continental
congress
by
limiting
length
of
service
there
it
was
jefferson
who
was
asked
to
draw
the
bill
in
doing
so
he
followed
his
own
previously
expressed
convictions
about
the
desirability
of
rotation
in
office
and
he
appears
not
to
have
offended
lee
an
even
better
illustration
of
his
amiability
can
be
drawn
from
the
continuing
cordiality
of
his
personal
relations
with
pendleton
whom
he
sharply
opposed
on
important
questions
of
policy
pendleton
himself
deserves
much
of
the
credit
for
this
however
he
never
ceased
to
be
a
gentleman
the
strength
of
jefferson
s
position
at
this
stage
did
not
lie
in
political
organization
it
lay
in
his
personal
effectiveness
his
conciliatory
manners
his
enduring
friendships
his
disinterested
patriotism
and
the
intrinsic
forcefulness
of
his
ideas
he
carried
with
him
to
the
house
of
delegates
a
more
definite
and
comprehensive
program
of
reform
than
anyone
else
had
formulated
but
he
realized
that
certain
desirable
ends
could
not
be
immediately
attained
and
was
willing
to
be
patient
it
seems
unlikely
that
he
was
as
deeply
disturbed
about
the
defects
of
the
constitution
while
a
member
of
the
dominating
legislative
department
as
he
was
during
and
after
his
governorship
but
even
if
he
had
been
he
was
convinced
that
a
specially
chosen
convention
was
necessary
for
a
revision
of
the
frame
of
government
the
prospect
of
such
a
convention
became
more
not
less
remote
as
the
war
went
on
accordingly
he
had
to
content
himself
with
operating
within
the
existing
framework
he
judged
however
that
the
general
spirit
of
the
times
was
more
favorable
to
political
change
than
it
was
likely
to
be
after
the
military
conflict
was
over
and
he
tried
to
take
full
advantage
of
every
opportunity
to
translate
human
rights
into
legal
forms
he
was
a
long
range
optimist
and
had
a
high
degree
of
general
confidence
in
human
nature
but
he
was
never
disposed
to
leave
human
rights
to
chance
in
regard
to
political
rulers
he
was
a
consistent
pessimist
for
he
was
convinced
that
if
left
to
themselves
they
would
become
tyrannical
and
corrupt
also
he
was
convinced
that
rebellions
and
convulsions
were
inevitable
if
crying
abuses
were
not
corrected
this
was
not
pessimism
precisely
but
it
reflected
a
more
acute
consciousness
of
wrong
and
injustice
than
is
common
among
men
particularly
among
men
who
themselves
are
privileged
most
of
his
local
contemporaries
were
more
complacent
and
unlike
him
some
of
them
were
greedy
but
it
was
not
because
of
conspicuous
lack
of
integrity
or
patriotism
on
their
part
that
he
raised
and
bore
forward
the
standard
of
enlightened
liberalism
during
these
years
in
general
he
thought
well
of
his
colleagues
but
he
was
acutely
aware
of
the
dangers
of
apathy
and
he
believed
in
striking
while
the
iron
is
hot
somewhat
later
in
his
notes
on
virginia
he
said
it
can
never
be
too
often
repeated
that
the
time
for
fixing
every
essential
right
on
a
legal
basis
is
while
our
rulers
are
honest
and
ourselves
united
from
the
conclusion
of
this
war
we
shall
be
going
down
hill
it
will
not
then
be
necessary
to
resort
every
moment
to
the
people
for
support
they
will
be
forgotten
therefore
and
their
rights
disregarded
they
will
forget
themselves
but
in
the
sole
faculty
of
making
money
and
will
never
think
of
uniting
to
effect
a
due
respect
for
their
rights
the
shackles
therefore
which
shall
not
be
knocked
off
at
the
conclusion
of
this
war
will
remain
on
us
long
will
be
made
heavier
and
heavier
till
our
rights
shall
revive
or
expire
in
convulsion
as
a
political
strategist
jefferson
sought
to
take
advantage
of
the
general
spirit
of
a
time
when
conservatives
had
not
become
deeply
alarmed
and
when
lip
service
at
least
was
rendered
the
liberal
and
humane
ideas
of
the
enlightenment
also
as
a
legislative
tactician
he
recognized
the
importance
of
seizing
the
initiative
this
is
one
reason
why
his
first
session
was
such
a
busy
one
his
earliest
recorded
action
could
hardly
have
been
termed
radical
though
it
was
typical
of
him
in
its
emphasis
on
legal
regularity
he
asked
leave
to
bring
in
a
bill
for
the
establishment
of
courts
of
justice
a
measure
of
this
sort
might
have
been
expected
to
appeal
to
men
of
conservative
temper
concerned
to
restore
orderly
processes
but
the
immediate
opening
of
all
the
courts
was
opposed
by
landed
gentlemen
on
other
grounds
numerous
planters
were
included
among
the
debtors
who
feared
legal
action
at
a
time
when
tobacco
was
almost
valueless
as
a
commodity
jefferson
himself
was
aware
of
the
difficulty
and
became
reconciled
to
the
enforced
delay
he
had
to
wait
for
the
opening
of
most
of
the
courts
he
also
had
to
wait
for
the
removal
of
the
seat
of
government
from
williamsburg
to
a
more
central
place
his
bill
calling
for
this
was
ostensibly
designed
for
the
convenience
of
the
members
and
citizens
but
it
bore
a
progressive
stamp
for
it
was
primarily
a
move
against
tidewater
dominance
interest
combined
with
inertia
to
defeat
it
a
month
after
he
introduced
it
during
the
first
week
of
his
first
session
however
the
stage
was
set
for
the
most
important
of
his
immediate
activities
as
a
legislator
and
reformer
the
date
october
was
significant
in
his
history
for
on
that
day
the
house
of
delegates
gave
leave
for
the
preparation
of
two
bills
one
of
these
was
to
enable
tenants
in
fee
tail
to
convey
their
lands
in
fee
simple
while
the
other
called
for
the
general
revision
of
the
laws
of
the
two
actions
the
latter
was
the
more
important
as
a
result
of
it
he
was
enabled
to
set
forth
in
due
course
a
long
range
program
emphasizing
humane
criminal
laws
complete
religious
freedom
and
the
diffusion
of
education
and
thus
to
appear
on
the
page
of
history
as
a
major
prophet
of
intellectual
liberty
and
human
enlightenment
but
it
was
his
bill
against
entails
introduced
on
october
that
he
afterwards
described
as
the
first
blow
against
the
entrenched
aristocracy
he
regarded
it
as
a
radical
action
and
always
prided
himself
on
being
the
wielder
of
the
ax
his
primary
objection
to
the
continuance
of
the
old
ruling
group
in
power
was
not
that
it
had
ruled
badly
for
as
contemporary
governments
went
it
had
not
what
he
most
disliked
about
the
existing
system
was
its
essential
irrationality
and
injustice
in
the
light
of
history
the
virginia
aristocracy
was
notable
for
its
sense
of
responsibility
but
jefferson
believed
that
it
could
not
long
maintain
its
high
sense
of
public
obligation
on
its
existing
foundation
the
trouble
was
that
it
was
based
not
on
merit
but
on
inherited
privilege
it
was
this
basic
privilege
that
he
sought
to
undermine
for
the
benefit
of
the
future
he
had
no
desire
to
reduce
government
to
the
dull
level
of
mediocrity
but
he
did
try
to
restore
what
he
called
the
natural
order
of
freedom
and
to
give
talent
and
virtue
which
were
scattered
through
all
ranks
of
society
a
chance
to
rise
his
purposes
may
now
be
regarded
as
democratic
and
he
himself
described
them
in
current
terms
of
natural
philosophy
but
they
may
also
be
thought
of
as
the
purposes
of
a
man
who
joined
faith
in
human
beings
with
common
sense
he
had
already
manifested
deep
interest
in
the
fundamental
question
of
the
distribution
and
tenure
of
land
he
was
thoroughly
aware
that
the
granting
of
large
tracts
to
influential
men
during
colonial
times
had
furthered
the
development
of
great
estates
and
that
the
power
of
the
ruling
group
was
based
on
these
he
was
opposed
to
the
granting
of
more
acres
to
persons
who
already
had
them
in
abundance
he
wanted
land
for
the
landless
he
had
proposed
to
the
convention
of
that
men
who
did
not
own
fifty
acres
should
receive
grants
enabling
them
to
attain
that
acreage
and
that
nobody
else
be
entitled
to
a
free
grant
he
had
shown
great
sympathy
for
the
squatters
in
outlying
districts
he
was
sure
they
would
settle
the
land
in
spite
of
everybody
he
favored
making
grants
to
them
in
small
quantities
rather
than
sales
he
wanted
them
to
hold
their
lands
without
having
to
make
even
a
token
payment
to
the
state
like
the
old
quit
rent
to
the
king
he
had
already
recommended
the
prevention
of
irresponsible
purchases
from
the
indians
such
as
had
been
made
by
western
land
companies
he
himself
was
not
appreciably
involved
in
western
speculation
he
had
inherited
from
his
father
a
share
in
the
loyal
company
in
which
his
neighbor
dr
thomas
walker
was
the
moving
spirit
but
nothing
came
of
it
he
afterwards
said
that
with
trivial
exceptions
he
never
was
interested
in
a
foot
of
land
off
the
waters
of
the
james
river
many
of
his
contemporaries
saw
in
the
vast
unallotted
domain
of
the
commonwealth
an
opportunity
to
build
up
and
perpetuate
individual
fortunes
but
he
saw
in
it
the
opportunity
to
create
a
stronger
society
of
small
farmers
in
the
course
of
his
legislative
career
he
concerned
himself
with
the
land
question
in
all
its
more
important
phases
and
he
viewed
all
phases
with
the
same
eyes
but
the
victories
over
landed
privilege
that
he
remembered
most
vividly
in
other
years
were
the
abolition
of
entails
and
primogeniture
the
two
reforms
were
widely
separated
in
time
since
one
of
them
was
effected
immediately
and
the
other
was
not
finally
brought
about
until
nearly
ten
years
later
but
he
coupled
them
in
his
own
mind
the
terms
themselves
are
relatively
unfamiliar
in
the
twentieth
century
and
jefferson
thought
them
already
archaic
in
the
last
quarter
of
the
eighteenth
they
signified
artificial
methods
of
restricting
inheritance
and
were
objectionable
to
him
on
rational
no
less
than
social
grounds
it
must
not
be
assumed
that
all
virginia
estates
were
entailed
peter
jefferson
s
was
not
and
even
in
tidewater
the
practice
was
by
no
means
universal
nor
should
it
be
supposed
that
they
descended
necessarily
to
the
eldest
son
for
this
they
did
only
in
the
absence
of
a
will
and
it
was
unusual
for
a
man
of
large
property
to
die
intestate
randolph
jefferson
had
been
provided
for
as
well
as
thomas
however
the
entailing
of
land
was
permitted
by
the
english
law
which
was
extended
to
the
colony
and
by
virginia
law
it
was
further
extended
to
the
slaves
annexed
to
the
land
thus
a
wealthy
planter
could
bequeath
all
or
any
part
of
his
estate
to
his
son
and
the
heirs
of
the
latter
s
body
begotten
or
to
the
heirs
begotten
by
a
particular
marriage
or
he
could
restrict
its
transmission
in
some
other
special
way
such
an
entail
once
made
was
protected
by
law
and
could
be
defeated
only
by
an
act
of
assembly
numerous
petitions
for
the
docking
of
entails
were
presented
at
sessions
of
the
house
of
burgesses
before
the
revolution
jefferson
himself
presented
one
on
behalf
of
his
wife
asking
permission
to
sell
certain
entailed
lands
and
to
entail
others
instead
such
petitions
were
commonly
granted
but
the
procedure
was
troublesome
and
wealthy
planters
had
frequent
occasion
to
regret
the
restrictions
on
the
disposition
of
property
which
dead
hands
had
imposed
this
was
probably
one
of
the
reasons
why
jefferson
s
bill
for
the
abolition
of
entails
was
passed
so
promptly
only
those
who
clung
most
tenaciously
to
ancient
establishments
strongly
objected
to
the
removal
of
this
relic
of
mediaevalism
after
it
was
seriously
proposed
by
a
forward
looking
man
among
these
traditionalists
he
named
pendleton
as
his
chief
opponent
according
to
his
later
account
this
adroit
parliamentarian
finding
that
he
could
not
maintain
the
general
principle
of
entails
proposed
and
almost
carried
an
amendment
which
would
have
left
to
the
landholder
himself
the
choice
whether
he
should
convey
his
lands
in
fee
simple
or
fee
tail
the
important
clash
was
probably
between
him
and
pendleton
on
this
issue
as
he
remembered
but
the
contemporary
record
shows
that
he
himself
introduced
a
moderate
proposal
much
like
the
one
he
afterwards
attributed
to
pendleton
then
apparently
growing
bolder
as
he
felt
out
the
opposition
he
proposed
and
carried
amendments
which
abolished
entails
altogether
thus
jefferson
not
only
simplified
an
exceedingly
complicated
situation
by
the
same
stroke
he
facilitated
economic
change
and
furthered
social
mobility
he
made
his
successful
attack
on
primogeniture
later
in
connection
with
the
general
revision
of
the
laws
when
he
drew
a
bill
directing
the
course
of
descents
he
was
elsewhere
when
this
was
finally
adopted
so
his
struggle
can
only
have
been
in
the
committee
he
said
that
pendleton
again
opposed
him
yielding
ground
amiably
when
forced
to
and
finally
urging
that
at
least
a
double
portion
be
allowed
the
eldest
son
even
after
the
passage
of
jefferson
s
bill
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
anyone
from
making
just
that
provision
by
will
and
he
may
have
exaggerated
the
effects
of
this
particular
reform
a
famous
foreign
commentator
on
american
democracy
alexis
de
tocqueville
afterwards
pointed
out
that
the
very
existence
of
a
law
of
partible
inheritance
deprived
fathers
of
the
inclination
to
discriminate
unfairly
between
children
even
in
this
region
of
plantation
seats
however
such
inclination
had
been
far
from
general
jefferson
did
not
destroy
the
country
gentry
as
a
group
with
the
blows
of
his
mighty
ax
and
there
is
insufficient
reason
to
believe
that
he
wanted
to
but
he
did
remove
legal
vestiges
of
old
world
aristocracy
the
abolition
of
entails
unlike
that
of
primogeniture
occurred
immediately
but
it
appears
to
have
aroused
relatively
little
resentment
one
arch
conservative
landon
carter
expressed
himself
about
it
violently
in
a
contemporary
letter
to
george
washington
which
is
noteworthy
in
another
respect
in
the
course
of
it
the
westmoreland
planter
addressed
the
general
as
my
dear
george
few
people
were
ever
that
familiar
with
the
stately
commander
and
few
people
then
were
equally
alarmed
this
embittered
proprietor
interpreted
the
movement
against
entails
as
an
attack
on
the
right
to
do
as
we
please
with
our
own
property
which
he
regarded
as
the
very
basis
of
the
american
contest
that
was
to
reduce
the
causes
of
the
revolt
to
a
narrow
compass
indeed
the
bill
was
then
pending
in
the
senate
after
having
passed
the
house
and
carter
s
prayer
that
at
least
ten
persons
could
be
found
to
reprobate
and
detest
such
a
crying
injustice
shows
that
he
regarded
the
continuing
opposition
to
it
as
slight
then
he
vehemently
exclaimed
it
is
called
docking
all
entails
but
is
it
not
entailing
one
they
cannot
docks
the
curses
of
posterity
on
them
who
must
in
that
very
contest
for
liberty
entail
a
load
of
debts
upon
those
who
are
to
come
after
they
have
robbed
them
of
their
very
estates
to
pay
that
debt
from
by
overturning
the
very
principles
of
justice
on
which
they
built
their
very
claim
of
freedom
this
is
what
i
call
sowing
the
seeds
of
contention
which
must
spring
up
sooner
or
later
and
all
from
the
poisoned
soil
of
popularity
as
this
observer
saw
it
the
greatest
danger
lay
in
the
craving
of
political
leaders
for
popularity
and
he
heaped
his
most
unflattering
comments
on
patrick
henry
speaking
of
him
ironically
as
this
great
man
in
connection
with
the
cursed
bill
however
he
specifically
mentioned
jefferson
and
obviously
he
found
that
propertied
gentleman
quite
incomprehensible
except
on
the
ground
that
he
was
a
midday
drunkard
thus
he
wrote
to
washington
was
any
man
in
your
camp
to
say
who
is
the
greatest
drunkard
and
most
pernicious
to
society
he
who
only
drinks
at
night
and
is
perhaps
ashamed
of
it
in
the
morning
or
he
who
gets
drunk
sub
die
at
mid
day
as
old
bacchus
used
to
say
i
dare
say
the
midnight
drunkard
would
be
the
most
to
be
respected
it
is
not
usual
for
those
who
are
against
a
bill
to
be
the
bearers
of
it
and
this
bill
as
cursed
in
its
nature
as
the
removal
of
a
neighbor
s
landmark
his
will
and
pleasure
in
giving
his
own
property
away
borne
about
by
the
famous
t
j
n
the
bearer
of
the
bill
against
entails
was
no
sort
of
drunkard
and
he
doubtless
included
landon
carter
among
the
half
dozen
aristocratical
gentlemen
agonizing
under
the
loss
of
pre
eminence
who
had
ventured
sarcasms
on
the
otherwise
peaceful
transition
from
a
monarchy
to
a
republic
in
the
summer
of
it
seemed
to
jefferson
that
the
people
in
general
had
simply
taken
off
an
old
suit
of
clothes
and
put
on
a
new
one
he
wrote
benjamin
franklin
not
a
single
throe
has
attended
this
important
transformation
long
afterwards
one
of
his
implacable
foes
said
that
the
bill
for
cutting
off
entails
was
of
obvious
necessity
from
the
form
of
our
new
institutions
and
the
prevailing
temper
of
the
people
and
had
only
to
be
proposed
by
any
member
in
order
to
be
adopted
by
a
large
majority
as
it
was
in
others
of
the
states
this
was
an
understatement
designed
to
belittle
jefferson
just
as
his
own
contemporary
remark
to
franklin
was
too
sanguine
he
had
aroused
some
fears
and
eventually
he
raised
up
a
host
of
bitter
enemies
but
he
does
not
appear
to
have
angered
many
people
before
his
governorship
of
virginia
this
was
partly
because
of
the
temper
of
the
times
it
was
also
because
his
own
program
had
not
yet
fully
unfolded
never
during
this
period
did
it
become
a
clear
issue
in
itself
his
land
reforms
were
part
and
parcel
of
a
movement
which
swept
through
the
other
states
and
resulted
in
the
abolition
of
primogeniture
and
entail
in
practically
all
of
them
within
ten
years
of
the
declaration
of
independence
it
would
be
too
much
to
claim
that
he
was
the
initiator
of
a
general
movement
which
was
actually
the
resultant
of
many
forces
but
he
undoubtedly
took
the
lead
in
the
large
and
influential
commonwealth
of
virginia
there
he
attempted
to
set
an
aristocratic
society
in
the
current
of
democracy
by
broadening
its
economic
base
in
the
next
decade
no
less
a
person
than
george
washington
observed
that
the
distinction
of
classes
had
begun
to
disappear
in
the
old
dominion
and
there
were
later
laments
because
historic
plantation
seats
had
passed
into
alien
hands
the
decline
in
the
fortunes
and
power
of
the
prerevolutionary
land
barons
may
be
attributed
to
deeper
causes
than
formal
legislation
however
and
the
blame
that
was
laid
on
jefferson
by
disgruntled
aristocrats
was
consider
ably
greater
at
a
later
time
than
during
the
early
years
of
the
revolution
it
is
doubtful
if
many
then
viewed
this
landed
gentleman
as
a
traitor
to
his
class
because
he
had
effected
the
abolition
of
entails
the
danger
really
lay
in
his
implacable
hostility
to
artificial
privilege
of
every
sort
that
was
sure
to
cause
him
trouble
sooner
or
later
because
he
was
certain
to
tread
on
the
toes
of
many
sorts
of
men
the
whole
record
of
his
thought
until
this
time
shows
that
his
policies
were
motivated
by
philosophical
rather
than
narrowly
political
considerations
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
was
ambitiously
courting
favor
with
the
multitude
nevertheless
in
actions
like
these
he
laid
the
firm
foundation
of
his
great
popularity
in
later
days
he
was
not
one
to
crack
jokes
around
a
campfire
like
patrick
henry
but
he
had
ideas
that
were
sure
to
appeal
to
common
men
his
conception
of
the
free
movement
of
property
was
quite
in
accord
with
the
philosophy
which
was
fated
to
become
dominant
among
ordinary
americans
the
expression
three
generations
from
shirtsleeves
to
shirtsleeves
sums
it
up
roughly
jefferson
did
not
say
this
so
far
as
is
known
but
in
any
age
he
would
have
disliked
any
and
all
schemes
designed
to
perpetuate
wealth
without
regard
to
the
capabilities
of
the
possessor
he
believed
in
freedom
to
acquire
property
which
to
him
was
largely
identified
with
land
and
for
all
his
generosity
he
was
tenacious
of
his
own
but
he
also
believed
in
the
freedom
to
lose
it
the
way
must
be
left
open
for
the
fit
to
rise
and
by
unavoidable
implication
for
the
unfit
to
fall
in
such
a
philosophy
there
is
relatively
little
comfort
for
the
sentimentalist
or
the
paternalist
but
to
americans
of
enterprise
it
has
sounded
like
fair
play
and
common
sense
jefferson
contributed
directly
to
the
development
of
representative
government
in
virginia
s
western
country
during
his
first
session
as
a
delegate
thus
aiding
the
small
settlers
in
the
way
he
regarded
as
most
fundamental
he
strongly
supported
the
movement
to
set
up
kentucky
as
a
new
county
which
succeeded
late
in
also
he
played
a
characteristic
part
in
the
continuing
conflict
over
the
granting
of
western
lands
though
he
did
not
afterwards
mention
this
among
the
important
services
that
he
rendered
his
state
his
silence
on
this
subject
may
have
been
partly
protective
for
the
implementation
of
his
progressive
ideas
was
faulty
and
the
results
of
the
policy
he
finally
approved
were
disappointing
in
the
perspective
of
history
however
his
concern
for
the
squatters
and
his
hostility
to
the
speculators
is
probably
more
significant
than
his
attitude
toward
outmoded
primogeniture
and
entail
this
was
a
more
controversial
question
and
being
also
more
confused
it
required
greater
vision
the
complex
problem
was
in
essence
twofold
settlers
had
filtered
into
the
unoccupied
lands
and
remained
there
without
title
and
various
land
companies
were
making
vast
claims
in
the
region
beyond
the
mountains
jefferson
s
fear
that
the
latter
would
be
supported
by
congress
was
a
major
reason
for
his
insistence
at
this
stage
that
virginia
maintain
her
western
claims
in
his
own
legislature
he
and
george
mason
tried
to
bring
order
out
of
chaos
to
safeguard
the
small
holders
and
to
defeat
the
excessive
claims
of
the
speculative
companies
they
may
have
differed
somewhat
in
emphasis
but
they
collaborated
in
bills
which
were
presented
in
january
and
were
the
undisputed
leaders
of
the
liberal
faction
by
this
time
they
were
forced
to
regard
the
western
lands
not
merely
as
a
seat
of
settlement
but
also
as
a
source
of
revenue
for
the
currency
was
rapidly
depreciating
and
there
was
need
to
support
the
credit
of
the
state
by
proceeds
from
sales
as
we
have
seen
jefferson
preferred
to
give
lands
in
small
portions
they
were
specially
anxious
to
defeat
the
purposes
of
outside
speculators
though
jefferson
s
policy
was
not
dictated
primarily
by
motives
of
local
self
interest
nor
even
by
theories
of
state
rights
it
was
based
fundamentally
on
human
grounds
in
mason
and
jefferson
were
defeated
by
the
conservatives
whom
pendleton
and
benjamin
harrison
led
the
latter
were
not
disposed
to
expedite
the
influx
of
small
settlers
into
the
west
for
they
feared
that
the
value
of
eastern
property
would
be
thereby
reduced
george
washington
agreed
with
them
that
soldiers
or
prospective
soldiers
would
be
drawn
off
and
for
this
reason
opposed
the
measure
the
conservative
leaders
also
had
a
tender
feeling
for
the
land
companies
in
which
they
were
personally
interested
in
varying
degree
to
use
modern
terms
they
upheld
private
business
interests
for
business
with
them
centered
in
land
on
the
other
hand
mason
and
jefferson
especially
jefferson
stood
primarily
for
the
public
interest
sought
to
further
actual
settlement
and
supported
unprivileged
common
men
in
consultation
with
jefferson
mason
redrew
the
bills
establishing
a
land
office
and
settling
the
western
claims
these
were
passed
in
june
after
jefferson
became
governor
they
took
care
of
persons
who
had
actually
moved
in
before
january
by
granting
them
four
hundred
acres
at
a
nominal
price
along
with
a
pre
emption
of
one
thousand
more
at
the
regular
price
of
forty
pounds
per
hundred
acres
provision
was
made
for
those
who
had
moved
in
since
that
date
by
granting
them
pre
emption
to
four
hundred
acres
at
the
regular
price
but
unhappily
nothing
was
done
for
future
settlers
what
amounted
to
a
compromise
was
worked
out
with
the
most
virginian
of
the
land
companies
and
provision
was
made
for
the
future
sale
of
the
remaining
lands
at
the
regular
price
without
limit
of
acreage
some
degree
of
order
was
thus
brought
out
of
chaos
but
events
proved
that
the
solution
as
a
whole
was
more
favorable
to
men
of
means
than
to
small
settlers
and
that
the
opportunity
to
establish
a
genuinely
democratic
land
policy
for
virginia
had
been
lost
absentee
owners
gobbled
up
huge
tracts
paying
for
them
in
depreciated
currency
and
poorer
farmers
soon
began
to
complain
certain
of
jefferson
s
long
range
purposes
had
been
sacrificed
to
the
attainment
of
immediate
results
but
to
him
doubtless
the
future
prospects
did
not
seem
unpromising
at
the
time
it
looked
as
though
there
was
plenty
of
land
for
everybody
poor
men
as
well
as
rich
could
take
advantage
of
the
depreciation
of
the
currency
and
if
large
estates
were
not
buttressed
by
artificial
laws
of
inheritance
nature
might
be
expected
to
set
centrifugal
forces
to
work
such
forces
were
actually
operating
among
the
aristocrats
of
virginia
already
for
other
than
legislative
reasons
war
and
debt
threatened
to
exact
a
toll
which
jefferson
himself
did
not
regard
as
just
or
desirable
his
efforts
to
solve
the
problem
of
the
outstanding
obligations
of
virginians
to
british
merchants
proved
as
futile
as
any
human
attempt
to
stay
a
storm
and
in
his
own
case
they
were
positively
harmful
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
his
honorable
intentions
in
his
first
session
when
his
plans
for
the
immediate
reopening
of
the
courts
were
blocked
by
fears
of
executions
for
debt
he
had
drafted
a
compromise
proposal
which
would
have
suspended
such
executions
whenever
suitable
security
should
be
given
for
the
eventual
payment
of
the
money
even
this
was
too
much
for
the
debtors
the
matter
was
deferred
and
not
until
january
did
jefferson
return
to
it
the
bill
he
then
presented
was
regarded
as
part
of
the
liberal
program
just
as
the
land
office
bill
of
that
session
was
but
it
would
have
been
better
for
him
if
it
had
been
defeated
his
bill
provided
for
the
sequestration
of
the
property
of
british
subjects
in
virginia
which
was
proper
enough
in
principle
it
also
provided
that
suits
between
british
subjects
and
citizens
of
virginia
should
be
continued
in
the
same
condition
as
they
were
before
the
courts
were
closed
and
to
this
no
valid
objection
could
have
been
raised
during
the
war
the
unfortunate
provision
was
for
the
discharge
of
debts
to
british
subjects
through
deposits
in
the
loan
office
which
was
set
up
a
debtor
could
make
payment
in
the
lawful
money
of
the
commonwealth
the
supposition
being
that
the
state
would
assume
responsibility
from
that
point
and
settle
accounts
with
the
british
after
the
war
the
trouble
was
that
eventually
the
depreciated
currency
of
virginia
as
jefferson
said
had
no
more
value
than
oak
leaves
without
going
into
the
tangled
story
of
the
postwar
period
when
these
obligations
were
adjudged
to
be
still
binding
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
jefferson
availed
himself
of
this
law
he
had
received
bonds
notes
we
should
say
from
the
purchasers
of
the
wayles
lands
he
had
sold
and
his
own
british
creditors
had
declined
to
take
these
if
they
had
accepted
them
events
proved
that
they
would
have
been
protected
by
the
treaty
of
peace
but
at
the
time
they
preferred
to
have
jefferson
continue
in
their
debt
he
was
afterwards
paid
for
these
bonds
in
virginia
currency
and
he
says
that
he
took
this
very
currency
to
the
loan
office
he
had
what
satisfaction
there
was
in
the
thought
that
it
was
used
by
the
state
in
the
conduct
of
the
war
but
he
had
to
pay
his
own
debts
all
over
again
the
full
effects
of
this
error
of
judgment
on
his
part
both
as
a
statesman
and
as
the
manager
of
his
own
affairs
did
not
burst
upon
him
until
after
the
war
was
over
he
then
bore
them
like
the
philosopher
he
was
his
other
important
activities
in
this
legislative
period
can
be
discussed
best
in
connection
with
the
general
revision
of
the
laws
which
occupied
a
large
part
of
his
attention
during
nearly
the
whole
of
it
in
that
great
task
he
showed
himself
to
be
a
statesman
in
the
best
sense
of
the
term
but
he
was
freed
from
the
necessity
of
adjusting
himself
to
the
exigencies
of
the
day
in
the
house
of
delegates
this
notable
work
of
legal
draftsmanship
provides
a
surer
index
of
his
intelligence
and
prophetic
vision
than
any
he
gave
as
a
leader
on
the
floor
also
by
means
of
it
he
commended
himself
far
more
to
distant
generations
xix
architect
of
laws
slavery
and
crime
it
is
doubtful
if
many
of
jefferson
s
colleagues
in
the
virginia
assembly
when
they
passed
the
bill
calling
for
a
revision
of
the
laws
had
any
such
far
reaching
and
philosophical
purposes
in
mind
as
he
did
now
that
the
king
and
his
minions
no
longer
stood
in
the
way
he
believed
that
the
code
should
be
corrected
with
a
single
eye
to
reason
and
the
good
of
those
for
whose
government
it
was
framed
the
legislators
were
prompt
however
and
they
showed
their
willingness
to
give
him
the
lead
by
naming
him
first
on
the
committee
of
five
to
make
recommendations
it
was
a
distinguished
list
after
him
came
pendleton
and
wythe
the
learned
george
mason
and
the
liberal
minded
thomas
ludwell
lee
george
wythe
resigned
from
congress
in
order
to
accept
what
he
regarded
as
a
more
important
appointment
they
met
for
a
preliminary
conference
in
fredericksburg
in
january
and
the
final
report
was
submitted
two
and
a
half
years
later
after
both
pendleton
and
wythe
had
become
judges
and
jefferson
had
begun
his
term
as
governor
the
best
account
of
the
procedure
has
been
given
by
him
himself
and
it
shows
that
he
intended
to
be
practical
in
action
despite
his
larger
philosophical
purposes
at
the
first
and
only
meeting
of
the
whole
committee
of
five
persons
the
question
was
discussed
whether
we
would
attempt
to
reduce
the
whole
body
of
the
law
into
a
code
the
text
of
which
should
become
the
law
of
the
land
we
decided
against
that
because
every
word
and
phrase
in
that
text
would
become
a
new
subject
of
criticism
and
litigation
until
its
sense
should
have
been
settled
by
numerous
decisions
and
that
in
the
meantime
the
rights
of
property
would
be
in
the
air
we
concluded
not
to
meddle
with
the
common
law
i
e
the
law
ing
the
existence
of
the
statutes
further
than
to
accommodate
it
to
our
new
principles
and
circumstances
but
to
take
up
the
whole
body
of
statutes
and
virginia
laws
to
leave
out
everything
obsolete
or
improper
insert
what
was
wanting
and
reduce
the
whole
within
as
moderate
a
compass
as
it
would
bear
and
to
the
plain
language
of
common
sense
divested
of
the
verbiage
the
barbarous
tautologies
and
redundancies
which
render
the
british
statutes
unintelligible
from
this
however
were
excepted
the
ancient
statutes
particularly
those
commented
on
by
lord
coke
the
language
of
which
is
simple
and
the
meaning
of
every
word
so
well
settled
by
decisions
as
to
make
it
safest
not
to
change
words
where
the
sense
was
to
be
retained
oddly
enough
pendleton
who
generally
supported
ancient
things
favored
the
preparation
of
a
new
and
complete
institute
on
the
model
of
blackstone
he
was
backed
by
lee
but
the
other
three
members
opposed
for
the
reason
already
mentioned
and
the
further
reason
that
such
an
undertaking
would
have
been
too
arduous
and
bold
even
the
more
limited
task
which
was
agreed
upon
seemed
too
arduous
for
mason
who
claimed
that
he
was
not
well
enough
read
in
the
law
and
asked
to
be
relieved
soon
thereafter
lee
died
so
the
work
was
distributed
among
the
remaining
three
jefferson
s
assignment
consisted
of
the
common
law
insofar
as
they
thought
of
altering
it
and
the
statutes
to
the
legal
beginning
of
the
colony
the
remainder
of
the
english
statutes
were
committed
to
wythe
and
the
virginia
laws
to
pendleton
the
division
threw
into
jefferson
s
part
the
laws
concerning
crimes
and
punishments
descents
and
religion
he
also
considered
the
question
of
public
education
and
ventured
far
into
the
domain
of
f
the
virginia
laws
though
these
were
specifically
assigned
to
pendleton
one
reason
for
this
was
that
he
did
a
good
deal
of
editing
in
connection
with
pendleton
s
portion
the
revisors
worked
separately
but
in
the
spring
of
they
met
in
williamsburg
and
went
over
the
first
two
sections
weighing
and
correcting
every
word
and
reducing
them
to
the
form
in
which
they
were
afterwards
reported
when
they
got
to
the
third
part
however
they
found
that
pendleton
instead
of
simplifying
the
language
of
the
virginia
laws
had
copied
the
acts
verbatim
only
omitting
what
was
disapproved
being
called
home
by
a
family
matter
he
asked
the
two
others
to
put
his
draft
in
the
form
they
desired
and
authorized
them
to
report
him
as
concurring
the
report
finally
submitted
to
the
general
assembly
included
one
hundred
and
twenty
six
bills
a
few
of
these
which
were
of
immediate
importance
were
translated
into
law
at
that
very
session
but
amid
the
exigencies
of
war
the
report
as
a
whole
was
deferred
it
languished
for
five
years
longer
then
when
jefferson
was
back
in
the
continental
congress
for
a
spell
it
was
printed
at
the
instance
of
james
madison
certain
conservatives
at
that
time
opposed
the
code
on
general
principles
but
madison
found
it
more
popular
in
the
assembly
than
he
had
expected
and
during
the
next
two
years
as
the
result
of
persistent
pressure
on
his
part
approximately
half
the
bills
became
law
without
serious
amendment
the
remainder
were
referred
to
a
new
committee
and
in
the
course
of
time
approximately
as
many
more
were
enacted
in
substance
jefferson
himself
was
in
france
while
his
friend
madison
was
struggling
so
valiantly
he
was
secretary
of
state
in
george
washington
s
first
administration
before
the
last
of
the
british
laws
had
been
repealed
and
the
legal
transition
from
colony
to
commonwealth
had
been
completed
after
he
went
to
europe
and
began
to
circulate
in
philosophical
circles
there
jefferson
remarked
to
a
friend
that
only
three
or
four
bills
in
the
revisal
would
strike
the
attention
of
foreigners
the
bulk
of
it
was
indeed
local
in
its
nature
he
could
hardly
expect
european
savants
and
illuminati
to
be
interested
in
measures
dealing
with
the
organization
of
the
militia
the
prevention
of
the
infection
of
horned
cattle
the
improvement
of
the
breed
of
horses
and
the
apprehension
of
horse
stealers
insofar
as
jefferson
himself
dealt
with
such
matters
he
was
the
philosopher
come
to
earth
and
performing
a
useful
mundane
function
the
three
or
four
bills
that
he
deemed
generally
interesting
however
were
broadly
philosophical
in
concept
and
still
command
attention
after
a
century
and
a
half
they
can
be
easily
singled
out
as
the
ones
dealing
with
citizenship
crime
and
punishment
religion
and
education
and
the
credit
for
all
of
these
belongs
to
him
before
considering
them
however
we
must
first
mention
the
important
question
of
slavery
jefferson
would
not
have
placed
on
any
select
list
the
bill
on
this
subject
for
it
was
merely
a
digest
of
existing
laws
by
the
time
that
the
revisors
submitted
their
formal
report
they
did
not
need
to
recommend
that
the
importation
of
slaves
be
prohibited
the
assembly
had
already
seen
to
that
and
according
to
jefferson
s
later
account
the
action
was
taken
on
his
motion
in
this
instance
he
seems
to
have
fallen
into
the
not
unnatural
error
of
confusing
the
general
with
the
particular
he
favored
the
discontinuance
of
the
slave
trade
before
the
revolution
and
definitely
proposed
it
as
early
as
but
the
successful
measure
of
was
introduced
by
another
at
a
time
when
he
was
not
present
in
the
house
however
there
can
be
no
possible
question
that
he
favored
the
bill
and
his
general
attitude
was
so
well
known
that
even
a
bitter
enemy
attributed
this
salutary
reform
to
him
in
later
years
also
he
strongly
favored
emancipation
the
revisors
had
a
plan
he
said
and
had
embodied
it
in
an
amendment
which
was
to
be
presented
whenever
the
bill
on
slaves
was
taken
up
it
was
not
taken
up
until
after
he
had
gone
away
and
those
who
were
then
on
the
ground
concluded
that
the
public
mind
would
not
bear
the
proposition
he
himself
was
acutely
aware
of
the
difficulties
of
the
situation
but
he
abundantly
revealed
the
depth
of
his
own
feeling
on
this
dark
subject
in
certain
passages
in
his
notes
on
virginia
he
wrote
these
before
the
revisors
report
had
been
printed
and
without
knowing
that
they
would
ever
meet
the
public
eye
he
had
perceived
an
encouraging
change
in
attitude
since
the
beginning
of
the
revolution
he
said
the
harshness
of
masters
was
abating
the
spirit
of
the
slaves
was
rising
from
the
dust
and
the
condition
of
the
latter
was
being
mollified
but
no
one
could
find
in
his
words
any
ground
whatsoever
for
the
opinion
that
slavery
in
eighteenth
century
virginia
was
or
would
ever
become
a
beneficent
institution
he
regarded
it
as
fundamentally
cruel
and
was
in
no
possible
doubt
that
it
undermined
the
morals
and
destroyed
the
industry
of
the
masters
while
degrading
the
victims
worst
of
all
it
sapped
the
foundation
of
all
liberties
by
denying
that
freedom
was
the
gift
of
god
and
the
birthright
of
all
men
regardless
of
their
color
or
condition
all
this
he
said
much
better
than
anyone
can
paraphrase
it
in
a
passage
which
became
deservedly
famous
there
must
doubtless
be
an
unhappy
influence
on
the
manners
of
our
people
produced
by
the
existence
of
slavery
among
us
the
whole
commerce
between
master
and
slave
is
a
perpetual
exercise
of
the
most
boisterous
passions
the
most
unremitting
despotism
on
the
one
part
and
degrading
submissions
on
the
other
our
children
see
this
and
learn
to
imitate
it
for
man
is
an
imitative
animal
if
a
parent
could
find
no
motive
either
in
his
philanthropy
or
his
self
love
for
restraining
the
intemperance
of
passion
towards
his
slave
it
should
always
be
a
sufficient
one
that
his
child
is
present
but
generally
it
is
not
sufficient
the
parent
storms
the
child
looks
on
catches
the
liniments
of
wrath
puts
on
the
same
airs
in
the
circle
of
smaller
slaves
gives
a
loose
to
the
worst
of
passions
and
thus
nursed
educated
and
daily
exercised
in
tyranny
cannot
but
be
stamped
by
it
with
odious
peculiarities
the
man
must
be
a
prodigy
who
can
retain
his
manners
and
morals
undepraved
by
such
circumstances
and
with
what
execrations
should
the
statesman
be
loaded
who
permitting
one
half
the
citizens
thus
to
trample
on
the
rights
of
the
other
transforms
those
into
despots
and
these
into
enemies
destroys
the
morals
of
the
one
part
and
the
amor
patriae
of
the
other
with
the
morals
of
the
people
their
industry
also
is
destroyed
for
in
a
warm
climate
no
man
will
labour
for
himself
who
can
make
another
labour
for
him
this
is
so
true
that
of
the
proprietors
of
slaves
a
very
small
proportion
indeed
are
ever
seen
to
labour
and
can
the
liberties
of
a
nation
be
thought
secure
when
we
have
removed
their
only
firm
basis
a
conviction
in
the
minds
of
the
people
that
these
liberties
are
of
the
gift
of
gods
that
they
are
not
to
be
violated
but
with
his
wraths
indeed
i
tremble
for
my
country
when
i
reflect
that
god
is
just
that
his
justice
cannot
sleep
forever
that
considering
numbers
nature
and
natural
means
only
a
revolution
of
the
wheel
of
fortune
an
exchange
of
situation
is
among
possible
events
that
it
may
become
probable
by
supernatural
interference
the
almighty
has
no
attribute
which
can
take
side
with
us
in
such
a
contest
the
accuracy
of
his
startling
picture
of
the
actual
operations
of
slavery
was
afterwards
questioned
by
reputable
observers
he
must
have
witnessed
such
scenes
of
fury
as
he
described
but
passionate
despots
were
probably
less
common
than
he
implied
especially
in
the
household
john
taylor
of
caroline
for
one
thought
that
safaris
called
forth
feelings
of
benevolence
far
more
often
than
angry
violence
but
jefferson
s
opposition
to
slavery
was
primarily
on
moral
grounds
and
he
combined
compassion
for
the
victims
with
an
even
deeper
concern
for
the
character
of
the
masters
and
the
dignity
of
human
nature
in
his
notes
on
virginia
he
also
gave
currency
to
the
plan
of
gradual
emancipation
which
was
drawn
by
the
revisors
to
remedy
the
highly
undesirable
situation
this
provided
that
all
slaves
born
after
the
passing
of
the
act
should
be
freed
that
they
should
remain
with
their
parents
for
a
time
that
they
should
be
trained
at
public
expense
for
useful
employment
and
that
they
should
be
colonized
as
soon
as
they
reached
maturity
he
purposed
to
send
them
somewhere
probably
into
the
vast
interior
of
the
continent
and
to
aid
them
in
the
establishment
of
a
free
and
independent
society
they
were
to
remain
in
alliance
with
the
white
man
s
state
however
until
they
should
be
strong
enough
to
stand
alone
meanwhile
an
equal
number
of
white
settlers
should
be
brought
from
europe
to
replace
them
it
was
a
humane
plan
and
he
regarded
it
as
realistic
according
to
his
own
estimate
there
were
considerably
more
than
two
hundred
thousand
slaves
in
virginia
at
this
time
comprising
almost
half
of
the
total
population
the
immediate
removal
of
that
many
inhabitants
comprising
the
bulk
of
the
laborers
would
have
disrupted
the
economy
and
jefferson
himself
did
not
regard
it
as
either
feasible
or
desirable
even
the
colonization
of
an
annual
crop
and
the
bringing
of
white
replacements
from
abroad
was
an
undertaking
which
would
have
staggered
a
more
timid
mind
it
was
much
simpler
to
leave
well
enough
alone
and
to
retain
the
laborers
virginia
already
had
he
did
not
want
them
kept
as
slaves
however
so
he
had
to
face
the
alternative
of
incorporating
them
into
the
state
after
they
had
been
freed
this
he
rejected
for
reasons
which
to
him
seemed
sufficient
deep
rooted
prejudices
entertained
by
the
whites
ten
thousand
recollections
by
the
blacks
of
the
injuries
they
have
sustained
new
provocations
the
real
distinction
which
nature
has
made
and
many
other
circumstances
will
divide
us
into
parties
and
produce
convulsions
which
will
probably
never
end
but
in
the
extermination
of
one
or
the
other
race
his
humane
mind
could
not
contemplate
such
a
prospect
with
composure
and
he
never
ceased
to
favor
a
policy
of
colonization
because
of
the
vividness
of
his
contemporary
comments
on
the
negroes
and
even
more
because
of
his
historic
eminence
they
have
been
frequently
drawn
upon
for
quotation
detached
from
their
context
however
they
can
easily
give
a
false
impression
in
comparing
the
blacks
and
whites
to
the
great
disadvantage
of
the
former
as
he
did
in
his
notes
on
virginia
he
was
not
endeavoring
to
sum
up
the
common
talk
of
the
countryside
he
provided
unquestionably
a
valuable
index
to
local
opinion
and
to
this
opinion
in
its
most
enlightened
form
if
his
judgment
on
the
negroes
was
unfavorable
that
of
his
local
contemporaries
generally
was
probably
far
more
so
his
observations
were
less
notable
in
themselves
however
than
in
the
spirit
in
which
he
made
them
his
comments
on
the
race
were
those
of
a
scientific
mind
softened
by
humanitarianism
or
to
put
it
more
precisely
they
represented
the
tentative
judgment
of
a
kindly
and
scientifically
minded
man
who
deplored
the
absence
of
sufficient
data
and
adequate
criteria
there
were
more
distinct
traces
of
sentimentalism
in
his
attitude
toward
the
indians
whose
native
eloquence
he
extolled
extravagantly
but
he
felt
the
need
of
a
more
scientific
procedure
in
both
cases
thus
he
commented
to
our
reproach
it
must
be
said
that
though
for
a
century
and
a
half
we
have
had
under
our
eyes
the
races
of
black
and
red
men
they
have
never
yet
been
viewed
by
us
as
subjects
of
natural
history
furthermore
he
thought
it
a
circumstance
of
great
tenderness
that
an
unfavorable
conclusion
about
the
negroes
might
degrade
a
whole
race
of
men
from
the
rank
in
the
scale
of
beings
which
their
creator
may
perhaps
have
given
them
though
he
expressed
his
own
judgment
frankly
he
did
so
with
great
diffidence
i
advance
it
therefore
as
a
suspicion
only
that
the
blacks
whether
originally
a
distinct
race
or
made
distinct
by
time
and
circumstances
are
inferior
to
the
whites
in
the
endowments
both
of
mind
and
body
it
is
not
against
experience
to
suppose
that
different
species
of
the
same
genus
or
varieties
of
the
same
species
may
possess
different
qualifications
will
not
a
lover
of
natural
history
then
one
who
views
the
gradations
in
all
the
races
of
animals
with
the
eye
of
philosophy
excuse
an
effort
to
keep
those
in
the
department
of
man
as
distinct
as
nature
has
formed
them
this
unfortunate
difference
of
color
and
perhaps
of
faculty
is
a
powerful
obstacle
to
the
emancipation
of
these
people
many
of
their
advocates
while
they
wish
to
vindicate
the
liberty
of
human
nature
are
anxious
also
to
preserve
its
dignity
and
beauty
some
of
these
embarrassed
by
the
question
what
further
is
to
be
done
with
them
join
themselves
in
opposition
with
those
who
are
actuated
by
sordid
avarice
only
among
the
romans
emancipation
required
but
one
effort
the
slave
when
made
free
might
mix
with
without
staining
the
blood
of
his
master
but
with
us
a
second
is
necessary
unknown
to
history
when
freed
he
is
to
be
removed
beyond
the
reach
of
mixture
he
was
not
talking
to
the
unlettered
and
inarticulate
slaves
nor
to
their
distant
descendants
thousands
of
whom
now
bear
the
marks
of
physical
mixture
it
would
have
been
truly
a
circumstance
of
great
tenderness
if
he
had
been
he
was
not
even
addressing
his
countrymen
who
were
obviously
not
ready
for
the
dose
of
emancipation
and
personal
restraint
he
would
have
prescribed
he
was
thinking
aloud
in
the
invisible
presence
of
the
world
s
humane
philosophers
propounding
the
gravest
of
social
questions
and
giving
his
own
answers
with
tentativeness
and
becoming
modesty
he
did
not
want
the
problem
to
go
by
default
but
there
was
little
he
could
do
then
and
there
except
think
about
it
as
an
observer
he
maintained
an
open
mind
about
the
abilities
and
potentialities
of
the
subject
race
years
later
he
learned
with
great
pleasure
that
there
was
in
the
united
states
a
very
respectable
negro
mathematician
on
receipt
of
some
of
his
work
jefferson
wrote
nobody
wishes
more
than
i
do
to
see
such
proofs
as
you
exhibit
that
nature
has
given
to
our
black
brethren
talents
equal
to
those
of
the
other
colors
of
men
and
that
the
appearance
of
a
want
of
them
is
owing
merely
to
the
degraded
condition
of
their
existence
both
in
africa
and
america
i
can
add
with
truth
that
nobody
wishes
more
ardently
to
see
a
good
system
commenced
for
raising
the
condition
both
of
their
body
and
mind
to
what
it
ought
to
be
as
fast
as
the
imbecility
of
their
present
existence
and
other
circumstances
which
cannot
be
neglected
will
admit
the
negro
mathematician
found
him
deeply
sympathetic
with
his
aspirations
but
jefferson
as
a
philosopher
and
statesman
never
veered
from
his
pessimism
with
respect
to
the
fundamental
problem
he
was
nearing
eighty
when
he
wrote
these
words
nothing
is
more
certainly
written
in
the
book
of
fate
than
that
these
people
are
to
be
free
nor
is
it
less
certain
that
the
two
races
equally
free
cannot
live
in
the
same
government
in
the
next
decade
after
that
the
judgment
was
echoed
by
alexis
de
tocqueville
a
volume
would
be
required
to
assess
it
in
the
light
of
later
history
hence
all
that
can
be
said
here
is
that
jefferson
intended
his
judgment
to
be
both
kindly
and
realistic
jefferson
s
bill
declaring
who
should
be
deemed
citizens
was
a
part
of
the
revisal
this
was
passed
soon
after
he
became
governor
and
it
did
not
include
freed
slaves
however
it
did
include
all
white
persons
who
should
afterwards
migrate
into
the
state
and
give
proof
of
intent
to
reside
there
it
contained
a
strong
assertion
of
the
natural
right
which
all
men
have
of
relinquishing
the
country
in
which
birth
or
other
accident
may
have
thrown
them
and
seeking
subsistence
and
happiness
wheresoever
they
may
be
able
or
may
hope
to
find
them
he
thought
it
important
and
when
he
was
combating
both
the
federalist
party
and
the
british
on
the
question
of
expatriation
he
listed
this
act
among
his
more
signal
achievements
liberal
provision
for
naturalization
was
quite
in
character
with
his
later
policy
and
his
pride
in
this
measure
was
wholly
justifiable
the
bill
for
proportioning
crimes
and
punishments
is
better
known
and
it
turned
out
to
be
much
more
controversial
it
was
not
considered
until
the
whole
report
was
brought
up
and
it
then
encountered
such
fierce
opposition
that
the
whole
revisal
was
endangered
the
hostility
to
it
had
not
subsided
a
year
later
when
despite
mollifying
amendments
it
was
defeated
by
a
single
vote
our
old
bloody
code
is
by
this
event
fully
restored
wrote
madison
to
him
in
france
jefferson
had
reason
to
be
disappointed
for
during
the
years
he
gave
more
time
to
this
bill
than
to
all
the
rest
together
it
required
him
to
go
through
the
saxon
period
of
the
law
consulting
authorities
like
bracton
and
to
study
the
chief
writers
on
criminal
law
such
as
beccaria
the
bill
he
drew
after
all
this
labor
is
notable
for
its
studied
simplicity
and
the
draft
he
submitted
in
advance
to
george
wythe
represents
probably
the
highest
point
he
had
yet
attained
in
craftsmanship
this
is
certainly
true
of
its
physical
form
for
it
is
an
extraordinarily
beautiful
document
for
the
benefit
of
his
own
memory
he
attached
notes
in
anglo
saxon
characters
in
latin
old
french
and
english
attesting
the
meticulous
carefulness
of
his
procedure
in
printed
versions
these
are
naturally
put
at
the
bottom
of
the
pages
but
jefferson
himself
placed
them
in
columns
parallel
with
the
text
after
the
manner
of
his
old
law
book
coke
upon
littleton
and
as
in
the
work
of
the
old
master
they
frequently
encroach
upon
the
text
the
penmanship
is
beautifully
clear
and
no
other
document
that
jefferson
ever
drew
better
exhibits
his
artistry
as
a
literary
drafts
man
the
main
significance
of
jefferson
s
proposals
lay
in
his
attempt
to
relax
the
severity
of
punishments
and
to
make
them
at
the
same
time
more
humane
and
more
rational
this
was
quite
in
the
spirit
of
the
enlightened
liberalism
of
the
age
which
he
so
well
embodied
his
purpose
had
been
formed
before
the
beginning
of
his
official
labors
as
a
revisor
and
had
aroused
some
forebodings
in
the
mind
of
pendleton
in
the
late
summer
of
that
realistic
observer
wrote
him
i
don
t
know
how
far
you
may
extend
your
reformation
as
to
our
criminal
system
of
laws
that
it
has
hitherto
been
too
sanguinary
punishing
too
many
crimes
with
death
i
confess
and
could
wish
to
see
that
changed
for
some
other
mode
of
punishment
in
most
cases
but
if
you
mean
to
relax
all
punishments
and
rely
on
virtue
and
the
public
good
as
sufficient
to
prompt
obedience
to
the
laws
you
must
find
a
new
race
of
men
to
be
the
subjects
of
it
but
this
i
dare
say
was
not
your
meaning
this
was
not
jefferson
s
meaning
and
when
the
time
came
all
of
the
revisors
agreed
with
him
that
capital
punishment
should
extend
only
to
treason
and
murder
as
reasonable
men
they
had
been
satisfied
by
the
writings
of
beccaria
and
others
that
extreme
punishments
were
neither
rightful
nor
effective
jefferson
s
summary
of
this
humane
and
rational
philosophy
in
section
i
of
his
bill
was
masterly
and
much
of
it
could
be
appropriately
quoted
in
the
twentieth
century
in
a
textbook
of
penology
it
is
no
longer
necessary
as
it
was
then
to
point
out
that
a
member
of
society
committing
an
inferior
injury
does
not
wholly
forfeit
the
protection
of
his
fellow
citizens
but
after
suffering
a
punishment
in
proportion
to
his
offense
is
entitled
to
their
protection
from
all
greater
pain
jefferson
aptly
described
capital
punishment
as
the
last
melancholy
resource
against
those
whose
existence
is
become
inconsistent
with
the
safety
of
their
fellow
citizens
and
he
called
attention
to
the
social
desirability
of
reforming
offenders
instead
of
exterminating
them
it
was
not
on
grounds
of
sentimental
humanitarianism
however
that
he
objected
to
extreme
severity
he
believed
the
experience
of
all
ages
and
countries
had
shown
that
cruel
and
sanguinary
laws
defeated
their
own
purpose
long
before
william
s
gilbert
had
conceived
the
comic
operatic
figure
of
the
mikado
he
sought
in
deep
seriousness
to
make
the
punishment
fit
the
crime
he
proposed
that
the
death
penalty
be
no
longer
exacted
except
in
cases
of
treason
and
murder
and
with
the
advice
of
the
committee
he
tried
to
set
up
a
scale
of
just
punishment
m
other
cases
he
was
notably
successful
in
attaining
his
purpose
to
frame
a
bill
that
would
be
comprehensible
to
laymen
he
wrote
george
wythe
about
it
in
it
s
style
i
have
aimed
at
accuracy
brevity
simplicity
preserving
however
the
very
words
of
the
established
law
wherever
their
meaning
has
been
sanctioned
by
judicial
decisions
or
rendered
technical
by
usage
indeed
i
wished
to
exhibit
a
sample
of
reformation
in
the
barbarous
style
into
which
modern
statutes
have
degenerated
from
their
antient
simplicity
and
i
must
pray
you
to
be
as
watchful
over
what
i
have
not
said
as
what
is
said
for
the
omissions
of
this
bill
have
all
their
positive
meaning
i
have
thought
it
better
to
drop
in
silence
the
laws
we
mean
to
discontinue
and
let
them
be
swept
away
by
the
general
negative
words
of
this
than
to
detail
them
in
clauses
of
express
repeal
his
bill
was
finally
rejected
in
his
own
country
largely
because
it
mitigated
penalties
in
advance
of
general
public
opinion
as
for
example
in
the
case
of
horse
stealing
from
the
point
of
view
of
contemporary
philosophers
and
from
that
of
enlightened
opinion
today
its
chief
weakness
lay
in
the
particular
penalties
he
substituted
for
death
he
had
recourse
to
the
lex
talionis
in
certain
cases
afterwards
he
said
that
he
could
not
remember
just
why
this
was
but
contemporary
records
show
that
it
was
partly
because
of
his
own
general
policy
of
going
back
to
simple
ancient
precedents
and
partly
because
of
the
judgment
of
his
fellow
revisors
thus
when
speaking
of
his
draft
to
wythe
he
said
i
have
strictly
observed
the
scale
of
punishments
settled
by
the
committee
without
being
entirely
satisfied
with
it
the
lex
talionis
altho
a
restitution
of
the
common
law
to
the
simplicity
of
which
we
have
generally
found
it
so
advantageous
to
return
will
be
revolting
to
the
humanised
feelings
of
modern
times
an
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
hand
for
a
hand
will
exhibit
spectacles
in
execution
whose
moral
effect
will
be
questionable
and
even
the
membrum
pro
membro
of
bracton
or
the
punishment
of
the
offending
member
altho
long
authorised
by
our
law
for
the
same
offense
in
a
slave
has
you
know
been
not
long
since
repealed
in
conformity
with
public
sentiment
this
needs
reconsideration
the
matter
may
have
been
reconsidered
but
the
scale
appears
to
have
been
left
without
material
change
at
all
events
the
following
section
appeared
ultimately
in
cold
print
sect
xiv
whosoever
shall
be
guilty
of
rape
or
sodomy
with
man
or
woman
shall
be
punished
if
a
man
by
castration
if
a
woman
by
boring
through
the
cartilage
of
her
nose
a
hole
of
one
half
inch
in
diameter
at
the
least
within
ten
years
when
he
was
in
paris
and
copies
of
the
revisal
had
been
circulated
among
the
intelligentsia
he
reported
that
the
principle
of
retaliation
was
much
criticized
and
that
in
the
case
of
rape
particularly
the
punishment
was
regarded
as
indecent
and
unjustifiable
he
himself
was
then
in
favor
of
altering
this
section
of
the
bill
though
for
another
reason
the
temptation
women
would
be
under
to
make
it
the
instrument
of
vengeance
against
an
inconstant
lord
and
of
disappointment
to
a
rival
he
was
willing
to
leave
the
more
unnatural
sex
crimes
largely
to
public
opinion
thus
in
his
own
mind
he
divided
the
genus
buggery
into
the
species
sodomy
and
bestiality
he
provided
a
severe
penalty
for
the
former
but
of
the
latter
he
said
in
a
note
bestiality
can
never
make
any
progress
it
cannot
therefore
be
injurious
to
society
in
any
great
degree
which
is
the
true
measure
of
criminality
in
foro
civili
and
will
ever
be
properly
and
severely
punished
by
universal
derision
it
may
therefore
be
omitted
it
was
anciently
punished
with
death
as
it
has
been
latterly
this
was
one
of
those
offenses
which
in
jefferson
s
opinion
should
be
pitied
rather
than
formally
punished
he
felt
much
the
same
way
about
excusable
homicide
and
suicide
in
the
effort
to
find
a
substitute
for
the
death
penalty
he
and
the
other
revisors
had
chief
recourse
not
to
retaliation
which
actually
was
invoked
in
relatively
few
cases
but
to
public
labor
this
was
to
be
performed
on
roads
canals
and
other
public
works
and
he
afterwards
concluded
that
it
would
not
have
reformed
the
offenders
when
tried
elsewhere
the
experiment
proved
unsuccessful
the
exhibition
of
criminals
as
a
public
spectacle
on
the
highroads
with
shaved
heads
and
mean
clothing
produced
in
them
an
abandonment
of
self
respect
which
plunged
them
into
the
most
desperate
and
hardened
depravity
before
the
virginia
assembly
got
around
to
passing
a
law
he
had
become
convinced
that
the
methods
of
confined
labor
being
tried
out
in
europe
as
they
were
later
in
philadelphia
constituted
an
improvement
and
he
himself
aided
his
countrymen
in
their
plans
for
a
prison
the
penitentiary
afterwards
built
in
virginia
was
hardly
an
ideal
institution
by
modern
standards
but
at
least
it
was
preferable
to
the
chain
gang
jefferson
expressed
only
mild
dissatisfaction
with
the
fresh
bill
that
was
adopted
by
the
assembly
in
by
then
the
legislators
were
willing
to
limit
capital
punishment
to
treason
and
murder
as
he
had
advocated
almost
twenty
years
earlier
instead
of
the
distinctions
of
murder
and
manslaughter
which
he
had
preserved
in
his
bill
they
introduced
the
new
terms
of
murder
in
the
first
and
second
degree
and
he
did
not
regard
himself
as
competent
no
judge
whether
or
not
this
constituted
an
improvement
he
continued
to
be
convinced
that
the
general
principles
he
had
enunciated
were
right
but
he
was
dubious
about
the
specific
penalties
he
had
prescribed
and
he
never
regarded
the
bill
on
which
he
labored
most
as
his
greatest
contribution
to
the
revisal
at
last
he
gave
that
honor
to
his
bill
for
establishing
religious
freedom
xx
church
and
school
of
all
the
contests
in
which
jefferson
engaged
as
a
member
of
the
assembly
of
virginia
the
one
on
the
subject
of
religion
was
the
most
bitter
he
himself
said
it
was
the
severest
of
his
entire
life
much
more
detailed
information
is
available
about
other
struggles
of
his
career
such
as
his
political
duel
with
alexander
hamilton
and
he
may
have
overestimated
the
rancor
that
persisted
in
his
own
state
after
the
disestablishment
of
the
church
by
championing
the
cause
of
freedom
he
probably
gained
more
friends
at
home
than
he
lost
for
the
dissenting
sects
were
grateful
most
of
the
attacks
from
which
he
suffered
in
later
years
when
he
was
a
more
conspicuous
target
originated
elsewhere
he
regarded
these
later
attacks
as
clerical
rather
than
religious
claiming
that
they
emanated
from
church
groups
closely
associated
with
state
governments
as
in
new
england
or
otherwise
moved
by
political
considerations
at
all
events
the
religious
controversy
persisted
in
some
form
to
the
end
of
his
life
and
even
pursued
him
beyond
the
grave
viewing
it
in
the
large
he
exaggerated
neither
its
intensity
nor
its
duration
as
a
member
of
the
committee
on
religion
he
was
in
the
thick
of
the
local
fight
from
the
outset
and
he
framed
his
famous
bill
for
religious
freedom
early
in
his
work
as
a
revisor
it
was
not
actually
introduced
until
after
he
had
become
governor
however
and
was
not
enacted
until
seven
more
years
had
passed
this
was
at
the
end
of
a
full
decade
of
legislative
conflict
in
which
many
men
were
engaged
and
importent
victories
had
already
been
won
for
freedom
the
credit
was
not
wholly
his
but
in
he
probably
was
the
foremost
advocate
of
the
entire
separation
of
church
and
state
in
virginia
and
unquestionably
he
became
the
major
symbol
of
complete
religious
liberty
in
connection
with
his
own
measure
such
he
remained
during
the
years
that
he
played
on
a
larger
stage
then
he
was
properly
acclaimed
as
a
prophet
correctly
judged
to
be
a
free
thinker
and
unjustly
charged
with
impiety
he
always
regarded
religion
as
a
strictly
private
affair
like
marriage
and
domestic
life
he
said
little
about
it
in
his
early
letters
and
he
undoubtedly
thought
in
as
he
did
in
that
his
personal
views
had
no
bearing
on
any
public
conflict
while
retaining
a
profound
belief
in
the
moral
foundation
of
the
universe
he
had
long
since
freed
his
mind
from
the
shackles
of
man
made
ecclesiasticism
and
doctrine
and
he
viewed
departures
from
orthodoxy
and
the
rise
of
dissenting
groups
with
complete
equanimity
indeed
his
respect
for
the
honest
opinions
of
all
men
caused
him
to
look
with
entire
tolerance
on
other
forms
of
religion
than
christianity
itself
when
asserting
that
the
legitimate
powers
of
government
extend
to
only
such
acts
as
are
injurious
he
said
but
it
does
me
no
injury
for
my
neighbor
to
say
that
there
are
twenty
gods
or
no
god
it
neither
picks
my
pocket
nor
breaks
my
leg
he
made
no
parade
of
his
own
free
thinking
he
neither
flouted
nor
derided
conventional
observances
and
he
was
a
scrupulously
moral
man
it
was
not
on
questions
of
private
morals
and
personal
beliefs
that
his
thought
centered
during
the
revolution
however
it
was
on
religious
freedom
and
the
relations
between
particular
groups
and
the
state
he
read
locke
and
shaftesbury
among
others
and
transcribed
notes
which
leave
no
doubt
about
the
trend
of
his
thinking
even
though
these
have
been
transmitted
to
us
in
scraps
he
was
convinced
that
complete
religious
freedom
should
be
recognized
by
human
law
because
of
the
very
nature
of
religion
the
care
of
every
man
s
soul
belongs
to
himself
no
one
can
prescribe
the
faith
of
another
god
himself
cannot
save
a
man
against
his
will
and
any
form
of
spiritual
compulsion
is
doomed
to
inevitable
failure
state
religion
therefore
was
to
him
a
contradiction
in
terms
the
state
should
neither
support
nor
oppose
any
particular
form
of
church
but
should
leave
all
of
them
strictly
alone
in
the
course
of
time
this
became
the
official
american
position
despite
the
musings
of
a
philosophical
statesman
the
position
of
the
established
church
in
virginia
would
not
have
been
seriously
challenged
but
for
the
rise
of
the
dissenting
sects
the
first
of
these
to
flourish
consisted
of
the
presbyterians
they
were
followed
by
the
baptists
who
were
the
most
severe
critics
of
the
establishment
and
by
the
methodists
who
had
a
low
opinion
of
the
spiritual
state
of
the
anglicans
but
still
regarded
themselves
as
part
of
the
mother
church
and
had
little
to
do
with
politics
the
complaint
that
the
parsons
of
the
establishment
were
cold
and
formal
which
was
made
by
the
fiery
evangelicals
did
not
impress
jefferson
for
he
made
a
point
of
keep
ing
his
own
emotions
under
strict
control
he
had
long
ago
observed
that
some
of
the
official
clergymen
were
immoral
and
slothful
and
he
did
not
condone
any
of
their
carnal
lapses
they
were
probably
as
good
as
most
of
the
clergymen
in
england
however
and
their
alleged
infidelity
was
not
alarming
to
a
disciple
of
the
enlightenment
who
did
not
even
admit
the
validity
of
the
term
jefferson
expressed
far
greater
bitterness
in
later
life
against
the
presbyterians
of
his
own
state
and
against
the
clergy
of
new
england
than
he
ever
did
against
the
colonial
anglicans
as
a
group
and
he
found
out
that
the
alliance
between
church
and
state
was
stricter
in
connecticut
and
massachusetts
he
wrote
john
adams
our
clergy
before
the
revolution
having
been
secured
against
rivalship
by
fixed
salaries
did
not
give
themselves
the
trouble
of
acquiring
influence
over
the
people
what
he
objected
to
on
rational
grounds
was
the
preferred
status
and
special
privileges
which
had
caused
them
to
become
an
artificial
aristocracy
and
enabled
them
to
exercise
an
unwarranted
degree
of
authority
he
believed
in
a
free
society
furthermore
he
noted
that
the
dissenters
now
outnumbered
the
anglicans
he
had
seen
plenty
of
them
in
albemarle
and
they
were
specially
strong
in
the
piedmont
country
generally
he
did
not
assert
that
they
were
persecuted
on
the
contrary
he
observed
that
after
a
century
of
dominance
the
spirit
of
the
anglicans
had
subsided
into
moderation
the
laws
remained
oppressive
however
and
the
spirit
of
the
dissenters
had
risen
to
a
degree
of
determination
which
commanded
respect
this
observation
suggests
at
the
same
time
his
own
attitude
his
friendships
continued
to
be
chiefly
among
the
anglicans
who
were
moderate
on
the
whole
and
he
had
respect
rather
than
regard
for
the
dissenters
but
he
was
unalterably
opposed
to
reserve
laws
he
regarded
uniformity
of
religious
opinion
as
no
more
desirable
than
that
of
face
and
stature
on
the
other
hand
he
saw
distinct
advantages
in
differences
of
opinion
for
the
various
sects
would
act
as
censors
of
one
another
he
rightly
concluded
that
in
this
matter
there
was
safety
in
numbers
the
assembly
of
did
much
to
relieve
the
dissenters
as
jefferson
himself
said
it
got
rid
of
statutory
oppressions
insofar
as
these
were
contained
in
acts
of
parliament
furthermore
it
exempted
dissenters
from
taxes
in
support
of
the
established
church
the
act
providing
a
fixed
salary
for
ministers
was
suspended
at
this
time
and
three
years
later
it
was
definitely
repealed
the
latter
action
was
taken
after
jefferson
had
framed
his
famous
bill
however
there
were
unsolved
problems
relating
to
the
power
of
vestries
and
some
questions
about
the
disposition
of
church
buildings
and
glebe
lands
were
not
finally
answered
for
a
generation
but
the
most
important
political
question
that
remained
was
one
of
policy
should
there
be
a
general
assessment
for
the
support
of
religion
or
should
the
churches
be
supported
wholly
by
voluntary
contributions
for
a
time
some
of
the
dissenters
favored
this
degree
of
connection
with
the
state
but
jefferson
believed
that
even
forcing
a
man
to
support
a
minister
of
his
own
persuasion
was
a
deprivation
of
liberty
and
it
was
in
reaction
against
the
movement
for
assessment
that
his
bill
was
finally
passed
at
the
common
law
he
said
heresy
was
still
a
capital
offense
and
by
act
of
assembly
denial
of
the
trinity
or
the
divine
authority
of
the
scriptures
was
punishable
by
disabilities
and
even
by
imprisonment
he
believed
that
the
public
was
still
secured
against
this
residue
of
tyrannical
laws
by
the
spirit
of
the
times
and
he
doubted
whether
the
people
would
suffer
an
execution
for
heresy
or
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
for
not
comprehending
the
mysteries
of
the
trinity
being
himself
unwilling
however
to
rely
on
a
temper
of
tolerance
which
might
prove
temporary
he
sought
to
sweep
away
all
such
laws
the
method
he
employed
was
not
one
of
detailed
specification
but
of
inclusive
statement
he
summed
up
everything
in
a
single
comprehensive
section
of
his
bill
sect
ii
we
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
do
enact
that
no
man
shall
be
compelled
to
frequent
or
support
any
religious
worship
place
or
ministry
whatsoever
nor
shall
be
enforced
restrained
molested
or
burthened
in
his
body
or
goods
or
shall
otherwise
suffer
on
account
of
his
religious
opinions
or
belief
but
that
all
men
shall
be
free
to
profess
and
by
argument
to
maintain
their
opinions
in
matters
of
religion
and
that
the
same
shall
in
no
wise
diminish
enlarge
or
affect
their
civil
capacities
he
went
the
whole
way
he
did
not
limit
liberty
to
protestant
sects
or
to
christian
groups
but
extended
it
to
all
without
any
qualification
whatsoever
also
he
sought
to
give
to
this
act
the
quality
of
eternity
in
the
third
and
final
section
after
admitting
that
no
assembly
could
pass
an
irrevocable
law
he
included
a
declaration
that
the
rights
which
had
been
asserted
were
of
the
natural
rights
of
mankind
in
the
philosophical
preamble
he
expressed
the
same
sort
of
thoughts
that
he
had
already
jotted
down
in
the
course
of
his
reading
his
sharp
condemnation
of
past
rulers
civil
and
ecclesiastical
who
in
impious
presumption
had
assumed
dominion
over
the
faith
of
others
and
thus
had
established
and
maintained
false
religions
throughout
all
time
over
most
of
the
world
represented
his
historical
judgment
and
his
objections
to
enforced
contributions
to
any
church
were
directed
particularly
against
the
assessment
bill
to
him
however
it
seemed
that
practically
everything
he
said
was
timeless
he
was
not
merely
expressing
thoughts
or
even
convictions
but
what
he
regarded
as
eternal
truths
nor
were
these
limited
to
the
subject
of
religion
they
constituted
an
assertion
of
complete
intellectual
liberty
the
mind
is
by
nature
free
and
altogether
insusceptible
of
coercion
the
opinions
of
men
are
not
under
the
jurisdiction
of
civil
government
truth
will
prevail
if
left
to
herself
errors
cease
to
be
dangerous
when
one
is
permitted
freely
to
contradict
them
some
of
these
maxims
of
his
own
faith
did
not
appear
in
the
final
act
his
bill
was
first
introduced
soon
after
he
became
governor
and
enough
people
then
regarded
it
as
a
diabolical
scheme
to
prevent
its
passage
sentiment
had
changed
by
the
end
of
the
year
after
he
had
crossed
the
atlantic
and
james
madison
had
persuaded
the
legislators
to
give
belated
attention
to
the
recommendations
of
the
revisors
they
were
then
ready
to
go
as
far
as
jefferson
desired
in
statutory
enactment
but
a
considerable
number
of
them
demurred
at
his
philosophical
preamble
it
was
then
proposed
that
a
brief
statement
from
the
declaration
of
rights
be
substituted
for
it
this
amendment
defeated
by
a
large
majority
in
the
house
of
delegates
but
it
up
again
in
the
senate
and
would
not
down
in
the
end
madison
to
the
deletion
of
some
of
the
more
sweeping
statements
about
the
supremacy
and
illimitability
of
reason
and
as
a
result
the
statute
did
not
rest
on
quite
so
broad
a
base
as
the
one
its
author
had
designed
nevertheless
madison
dared
believe
that
in
virginia
the
ambitious
hope
of
making
laws
for
the
human
mind
had
been
forever
extinguished
the
assembly
did
not
weaken
the
bill
enough
to
mar
jefferson
s
pride
in
authorship
and
before
a
year
was
out
he
was
rejoicing
over
the
favorable
notice
of
it
in
the
old
world
he
naturally
wrote
to
madison
who
had
presided
as
midwife
at
its
legislative
birth
the
virginia
act
for
religious
freedom
has
been
received
with
infinite
approbation
in
europe
propagated
with
enthusiasm
i
do
not
mean
by
the
governments
but
by
the
individuals
which
compose
them
it
has
been
translated
into
french
italian
has
been
sent
to
most
of
the
courts
of
europe
has
been
the
best
evidence
of
the
falsehood
of
those
reports
which
stated
us
to
be
in
anarchy
it
is
inserted
in
the
new
encyclopedie
is
appearing
in
most
of
the
publications
respecting
america
in
fact
it
is
comfortable
to
see
the
standard
of
reason
at
length
erected
after
so
many
ages
during
which
the
human
mind
has
been
held
in
vassal
age
by
kings
priests
nobles
and
it
is
honorable
for
us
to
have
produced
the
first
legislature
who
had
the
courage
to
declare
that
the
reason
of
man
may
be
trusted
with
the
formation
of
his
own
opinions
the
immediate
attention
this
statute
received
abroad
may
be
attributed
partly
to
jefferson
s
own
activities
for
he
promptly
had
it
printed
and
he
circulated
it
as
widely
as
he
could
its
importance
in
his
own
story
is
owing
partly
to
the
emphasis
he
himself
always
gave
it
he
rated
it
as
second
in
importance
only
to
the
declaration
of
independence
in
such
lists
of
his
own
achievements
as
he
afterwards
drew
up
as
an
official
pronouncement
it
emanated
from
a
single
common
wealth
not
from
the
federal
union
but
he
undoubtedly
believed
that
he
had
spoken
for
the
human
race
despite
the
deletions
made
by
the
assembly
it
was
a
proclamation
of
both
the
intellectual
and
the
religious
independence
of
the
individual
and
as
such
it
deserves
to
be
ranked
with
the
declaration
of
the
political
independence
of
a
group
of
states
its
fame
was
not
fortuitous
after
more
than
a
century
entail
a
half
it
remains
an
ineffaceable
landmark
of
human
liberty
and
men
in
any
land
would
do
well
to
turn
to
it
at
any
time
that
persecution
for
opinion
may
raise
its
ugly
head
before
he
knew
what
the
fate
of
his
bill
for
the
more
general
diffusion
of
knowledge
would
be
jefferson
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
was
the
most
important
one
in
the
entire
report
of
the
revisors
he
did
not
quite
mean
that
but
if
it
had
been
enacted
as
he
drew
it
and
proved
effectual
in
practice
it
probably
would
have
been
listed
with
the
statute
for
religious
freedom
among
his
greatest
achievements
unfortunately
however
it
was
not
passed
until
almost
the
end
of
the
century
and
he
could
take
little
pride
in
the
truncated
statute
which
then
emerged
from
the
legislative
mill
the
most
constructive
part
of
his
program
of
reform
remained
in
the
blue
print
stage
and
for
long
years
it
looked
as
though
his
efforts
to
illuminate
the
minds
of
the
people
generally
had
been
crowned
with
futility
in
the
light
of
history
however
nothing
else
that
he
did
or
proposed
during
his
entire
career
showed
him
more
clearly
to
be
a
major
american
prophet
by
the
time
that
the
report
of
the
revisors
was
submitted
when
he
was
thirty
six
he
had
ceased
to
be
a
mere
disciple
of
enlightenment
he
had
become
an
apostle
even
though
his
full
stature
was
not
yet
perceived
everywhere
in
long
retrospect
americans
have
come
to
regard
him
as
the
chief
prophet
of
public
education
in
the
first
half
century
of
the
union
and
it
is
doubtful
if
another
american
name
has
been
so
often
cited
in
popular
addresses
and
writings
on
this
perennially
interesting
subject
this
is
owing
in
part
to
the
political
eminence
he
attained
and
partly
to
the
apt
sayings
that
are
scattered
through
his
collected
writings
some
of
the
most
familiarize
of
these
quotations
are
from
private
letters
as
one
to
george
wythe
from
paris
in
which
he
said
preach
my
dear
sir
a
crusade
against
ignorance
establish
and
improve
the
law
for
educating
the
common
people
not
until
after
his
death
could
such
sayings
as
these
gain
wide
currency
and
they
might
have
remained
forever
unknown
if
he
had
been
politically
obscure
the
most
important
reason
for
the
recognition
of
his
importance
as
an
educational
prophet
however
is
that
his
fundamental
ideas
have
withstood
the
test
of
time
some
of
them
became
so
generally
accepted
that
they
can
almost
be
taken
for
granted
and
one
is
tempted
to
believe
that
they
were
indigenous
to
the
american
soil
they
found
fertile
ground
on
the
new
continent
beyond
a
doubt
but
before
they
took
root
they
had
to
be
seminated
jefferson
started
sowing
his
seed
in
the
early
morning
of
the
republic
there
have
been
other
conspicuous
crusaders
against
ignorance
but
he
anticipated
the
great
american
doctrine
in
the
bills
he
drew
in
virginia
also
he
added
refinements
and
qualifications
that
were
distinctive
of
his
own
discriminating
philosophy
and
even
now
the
larger
public
is
not
fully
aware
of
these
his
greatest
services
were
rendered
to
posterity
but
his
immediate
activities
stand
out
in
sharp
relief
against
their
specific
background
of
place
and
time
in
colonial
and
revolutionary
virginia
formal
education
was
largely
a
private
matter
and
its
benefits
were
almost
wholly
restricted
to
the
gentry
judging
from
its
fruits
including
jefferson
himself
the
system
was
better
than
he
thought
it
its
chief
merit
was
that
it
produced
capable
leaders
and
he
was
concerned
that
it
should
continue
to
do
this
on
the
basis
of
a
more
rational
plan
he
was
unquestionably
correct
in
concluding
that
the
existing
system
rested
on
a
dangerously
narrow
base
the
preamble
to
his
historic
bill
does
not
lend
itself
to
detached
quotation
as
the
sayings
in
his
letters
do
but
it
contains
a
clear
statement
of
purposes
he
continued
to
cherish
throughout
his
life
his
emphasis
was
on
public
purposes
the
most
important
of
these
was
to
guard
the
freedom
and
happiness
of
individual
members
of
society
but
he
did
not
describe
education
here
in
terms
of
personal
refinement
and
culture
fear
of
tyranny
even
though
this
was
only
incipient
tyranny
was
prominent
if
not
predominant
in
his
thought
he
saw
the
most
effective
preventive
in
the
illumination
of
the
mind
of
the
people
at
large
he
was
particularly
anxious
to
give
them
knowledge
of
the
facts
of
history
in
order
that
they
would
recognize
dangerous
political
ambition
in
any
shape
second
only
to
his
purpose
to
prevent
tyranny
and
safeguard
freedom
was
the
desire
to
assure
wise
and
honest
government
this
necessitated
the
training
of
leaders
nothing
in
his
plans
called
for
the
diminution
of
the
educational
opportunities
of
those
whose
parents
were
able
to
pay
for
them
however
he
expected
that
some
of
these
fortunate
persons
would
prove
unworthy
to
receive
and
unable
to
guard
the
sacred
deposit
of
the
rights
and
liberties
of
their
fellow
citizens
and
he
was
convinced
that
it
was
folly
to
leave
the
public
welfare
dependent
on
the
accidental
circumstances
of
wealth
or
birth
accordingly
he
sought
to
make
higher
schooling
available
without
charge
to
selected
youths
of
marked
native
ability
who
would
emerge
from
the
unprivileged
groups
from
our
point
of
view
jefferson
s
specific
proposals
represented
a
modest
compromise
between
public
and
private
education
but
in
contemporary
virginia
they
seemed
both
comprehensive
and
revolutionary
by
means
of
this
bill
for
the
diffusion
of
knowledge
he
sought
to
establish
throughout
the
state
schools
of
two
levels
the
hundred
schools
which
we
should
call
primary
were
to
serve
relatively
small
districts
or
hundreds
and
were
designed
to
effect
his
purposes
of
general
public
enlightenment
three
years
of
education
were
to
be
given
gratis
to
all
white
children
male
and
female
however
these
schools
were
not
to
be
wholly
public
for
any
child
whose
parents
could
pay
for
him
might
stay
longer
if
he
liked
on
the
next
level
there
were
to
be
grammar
schools
set
up
in
districts
including
several
counties
provision
was
made
for
the
lodging
and
boarding
of
the
students
the
state
was
to
own
the
grounds
and
buildings
but
most
of
the
running
expenses
were
to
be
met
by
the
parents
and
to
a
much
greater
extent
than
the
hundred
schools
these
were
to
be
private
only
the
youths
of
great
native
ability
raked
from
the
rubbish
annually
and
subjected
thereafter
to
specified
processes
of
elimination
were
to
be
supported
by
the
state
a
final
survivor
of
the
competition
was
to
be
sent
annually
to
the
college
of
william
and
mary
at
the
charge
of
the
commonwealth
not
very
long
after
he
drew
the
bill
jefferson
summarized
his
own
expectations
from
it
the
ultimate
result
of
the
whole
scheme
of
education
would
be
the
teaching
all
the
children
of
the
state
reading
writing
and
common
arithmetic
turning
out
ten
annually
of
superior
genius
well
taught
in
greek
latin
geography
and
the
higher
branches
of
arithmetic
turning
out
ten
others
annually
of
still
superior
parts
who
to
those
branches
of
learning
shall
have
added
such
of
the
sciences
as
their
genius
shall
have
led
them
to
the
furnishing
to
the
wealthier
part
of
the
people
convenient
skillets
at
which
their
children
may
be
educated
at
their
own
expence
these
proposals
reveal
him
as
a
realistic
and
discriminating
democrat
or
as
an
informed
and
critical
aristocrat
whichever
term
may
be
preferred
his
concern
was
to
broaden
the
educational
base
of
society
and
at
the
same
time
to
search
out
and
utilize
for
the
public
good
the
aristocracy
of
worth
and
genius
which
he
afterwards
described
as
the
most
precious
gift
of
nature
he
tried
to
frame
a
comprehensive
program
the
general
objects
of
this
law
he
said
are
to
provide
an
education
adapted
to
the
years
to
the
capacity
and
the
condition
of
every
one
and
directed
to
their
freedom
and
happiness
he
expected
no
utopia
overnight
but
he
was
convinced
that
he
was
on
the
right
track
in
later
years
his
american
countrymen
had
no
doubt
he
was
though
they
were
more
disposed
than
he
to
emphasize
quantity
for
its
own
sake
and
more
reluctant
to
apply
selective
standards
at
any
stage
of
the
educational
process
according
to
madison
the
assembly
gave
jefferson
s
bill
indulgent
consideration
when
they
took
it
up
in
but
they
deferred
it
barcaroles
they
regarded
the
financial
requirements
as
beyond
the
powers
of
the
state
the
author
himself
believed
that
the
necessary
tax
would
be
only
the
thousandth
part
of
what
would
be
paid
to
the
kings
priests
and
nobles
who
would
rise
up
if
the
people
were
left
in
ignorance
he
afterwards
said
that
wealthy
men
were
reluctant
to
assume
the
burden
of
educating
the
children
of
the
poor
but
other
practical
difficulties
may
be
recognized
which
reflect
less
on
human
nature
the
geographical
problem
was
particularly
difficult
naturally
and
properly
jefferson
devised
a
system
for
the
entire
state
but
this
was
relay
an
imperial
domain
including
a
vast
and
sparsely
settled
region
beyond
the
mountains
virginia
was
not
like
massachusetts
and
the
setting
up
of
primary
schools
which
would
be
within
walking
distance
of
every
house
would
have
been
difficult
and
costly
even
in
tidewater
jefferson
himself
stated
that
it
would
not
have
been
proper
for
him
to
specify
details
of
organization
but
actually
he
did
devise
and
incorporate
a
rather
complicated
general
plan
certain
features
of
this
came
in
for
valid
criticism
and
amendments
of
some
sort
were
necessary
after
he
had
finally
emerged
from
the
shackles
of
public
life
he
amended
his
own
plan
but
that
is
another
story
the
only
part
of
his
bill
that
became
law
in
the
eighteenth
century
was
the
portion
dealing
with
the
primary
schools
and
the
establishment
of
these
was
left
to
the
will
of
the
localities
as
things
turned
out
the
will
proved
lacking
all
he
was
able
to
do
therefore
was
to
set
up
a
guidepost
for
the
future
he
already
envisaged
a
system
of
public
education
which
had
as
its
apex
an
institution
of
the
highest
learning
but
his
legislative
efforts
to
transform
the
college
of
william
and
mary
were
unavailing
in
the
bill
he
drew
he
was
sharply
critical
of
his
alma
mater
baldly
asserting
bill
that
it
had
not
answered
expectations
he
regarded
it
as
subject
to
public
direction
however
and
believed
that
its
charters
could
and
should
be
so
altered
and
amended
as
to
render
the
institution
publicly
advantageous
in
proportion
as
it
was
publicly
expensive
furthermore
he
thought
it
the
peculiar
duty
of
the
legislature
at
this
crucial
time
to
aid
the
seminary
where
the
future
guardians
of
the
rights
and
liberties
of
their
country
might
be
endowed
with
science
and
virtue
to
watch
and
preserve
the
sacred
deposit
the
specific
amendments
proposed
by
him
looked
toward
the
much
closer
identification
of
the
college
with
the
state
and
the
enlargement
of
its
services
until
it
should
deal
with
all
the
useful
sciences
without
saying
so
precisely
what
he
really
anticipated
at
this
early
date
was
a
state
university
the
tie
with
the
state
was
to
be
tightened
by
causing
the
reduced
governing
board
to
be
elected
annually
by
the
assembly
and
by
providing
for
more
stable
support
from
public
funds
a
unique
administrative
provision
was
for
three
chancellors
to
be
chosen
from
the
judges
of
the
high
court
of
chancery
or
of
the
general
court
who
were
to
constitute
a
judiciary
in
all
disputes
relating
to
faculty
or
students
in
view
of
jefferson
s
later
role
as
the
founder
of
a
university
however
none
of
his
recommendations
are
quite
so
interesting
as
those
relating
to
the
enlargement
of
the
faculty
and
the
designation
of
fields
of
service
he
wanted
to
increase
the
professors
from
six
to
eight
to
get
rid
of
the
two
chairs
of
divinity
and
the
indian
school
and
to
introduce
the
study
of
law
medicine
history
and
modern
languages
there
being
no
longer
real
need
for
an
indian
school
he
thought
that
a
missionary
to
the
indians
might
be
appointed
instead
but
this
missionary
was
also
to
perform
a
scholarly
service
he
was
to
investigate
their
laws
customs
and
most
of
all
their
languages
on
half
a
dozen
counts
jefferson
showed
himself
in
this
bill
to
be
an
american
prophet
in
the
field
of
higher
education
he
himself
believed
that
it
was
defeated
by
the
dissenting
sects
they
still
looked
with
disfavor
upon
an
institution
which
had
been
historically
anglican
and
their
fears
were
not
allayed
by
his
amendments
he
was
not
permitted
to
transform
the
college
into
a
genuinely
public
institution
or
to
enlarge
its
faculty
during
his
governorship
however
when
he
served
as
a
member
of
the
board
of
visitors
he
was
able
to
change
the
professorships
to
some
degree
and
thus
to
become
a
pioneer
as
well
as
a
prophet
he
did
introduce
professorships
of
law
medicine
and
modern
languages
and
if
these
were
not
the
first
of
the
sort
in
the
united
states
the
people
in
williamsburg
have
been
many
years
in
error
law
and
medicine
were
committed
to
his
old
friends
george
wythe
and
james
mcclurg
while
modern
languages
were
entrusted
to
an
italian
charles
bellini
the
gratitude
and
affection
of
the
latter
for
jefferson
were
excessive
he
is
perhaps
the
only
man
in
history
known
to
have
addressed
the
philosopher
as
my
dearest
thomas
jefferson
took
special
pride
in
the
work
of
wythe
and
before
he
went
to
france
he
was
ambitious
to
add
other
professorships
on
the
ancient
languages
and
literature
of
the
north
for
example
also
he
still
wanted
to
find
somebody
to
deal
with
the
customs
and
languages
of
the
indians
not
for
long
years
did
he
return
to
a
detailed
consideration
of
the
needs
of
higher
education
but
in
one
fundamental
respect
he
showed
himself
in
his
late
thirties
to
be
qualified
to
found
a
university
his
scholarly
interest
was
universal
this
learned
and
extraordinarily
farseeing
architect
of
laws
and
institutions
also
sought
to
further
a
high
educational
purpose
by
establishing
a
public
library
in
richmond
his
bill
for
this
was
not
enacted
but
by
his
personal
activities
as
a
collector
of
books
during
these
revolutionary
years
he
amply
demonstrated
his
own
conviction
that
they
were
of
supreme
importance
no
american
of
his
generation
did
more
by
precept
and
example
if
anybody
did
so
much
to
emphasize
the
sacred
freedom
of
the
human
spirit
and
the
necessary
nourishment
of
the
mind
xxi
the
amenities
of
war
as
a
member
of
the
house
of
delegates
jefferson
did
not
have
a
full
time
position
it
is
true
that
the
sessions
were
longer
than
they
had
been
in
the
old
house
of
burgesses
once
he
was
seventy
nine
days
in
unbroken
attendance
but
even
in
these
war
years
this
was
unusual
and
despite
his
being
an
important
public
character
he
could
spend
most
of
his
time
at
home
his
work
as
a
revisor
of
the
laws
he
did
almost
entirely
at
monticello
since
that
was
much
the
best
place
to
do
it
his
library
there
was
growing
by
leaps
and
bounds
after
the
deaths
of
peyton
randolph
and
richard
bland
he
had
purchased
the
books
these
distinguished
kinsmen
had
left
including
some
rare
volumes
of
virginia
manuscripts
the
books
he
got
from
the
reverend
samuel
henley
after
that
philosophical
professor
left
the
college
of
william
and
mary
were
of
a
somewhat
different
character
but
everything
was
grist
for
his
mill
he
was
also
collecting

newspapers
and
laws
finding
that
many
of
the
latter
had
disappeared
he
set
out
to
assemble
all
that
remained
in
manuscript
in
fugitive
printed
sheets
or
in
any
other
form
while
acquiring
and
preserving
these
perishable
materials
of
local
history
he
was
thinking
of
posterity
but
he
was
also
facilitating
his
own
immediate
task
he
had
other
public
responsibilities
besides
those
of
a
delegate
and
revisor
but
most
of
these
were
local
in
their
setting
as
county
tenant
colonel
jefferson
had
to
do
much
paper
work
in
connection
with
the
militia
and
in
the
spring
of
his
name
was
added
to
the
list
of
albemarle
magistrates
as
a
justice
of
the
peace
he
kept
in
intimate
touch
with
the
affairs
of
the
commonwealth
whose
future
he
was
seeking
to
chart
and
through
letters
from
members
of
congress
he
whacks
informed
of
the
affairs
of
the
continent
he
showed
no
such
diligence
in
correspondence
however
as
he
did
later
much
of
his
time
was
given
to
the
public
councils
and
most
of
it
to
public
matters
but
he
could
continue
to
be
a
diligent
legal
scholar
an
enthusiastic
observer
of
nature
a
generous
country
gentleman
and
a
solicitous
pater
familias
this
was
a
combination
of
roles
he
greatly
liked
he
had
his
wife
with
him
briefly
in
george
wythe
s
house
on
the
palace
green
during
his
first
session
in
the
assembly
but
she
was
not
in
williamsburg
when
the
delegates
next
met
in
may
that
was
the
major
reason
why
he
himself
was
there
for
only
sixteen
days
in
a
session
of
eight
weeks
he
was
given
a
leave
of
absence
because
of
impending
domestic
events
at
ten
in
the
evening
on
may
after
he
got
back
to
monticello
their
first
and
only
son
was
born
this
short
lived
infant
appears
in
the
record
merely
as
our
son
for
a
time
they
probably
thought
of
him
as
another
thomas
but
presumably
he
was
never
christened
and
in
his
third
week
soon
after
ten
in
the
evening
he
died
for
more
than
a
year
longer
little
patsy
remained
the
only
child
she
was
nearing
six
when
her
precise
father
made
another
entry
in
his
notebook
our
third
daughter
born
he
recorded
on
august
giving
the
hour
as
a
m
undoubtedly
he
was
disappointed
not
to
get
a
boy
but
he
loved
children
even
girls
this
one
was
named
mary
it
may
not
have
been
wholly
on
her
account
that
he
remained
in
albemarle
until
the
fall
session
of
the
assembly
had
almost
run
its
course
but
by
that
time
the
persistence
of
this
young
life
seemed
relatively
sure
she
did
not
live
as
long
as
he
did
but
she
grew
up
being
afterwards
known
as
maria
and
more
familiarly
as
polly
she
became
a
pretty
lady
like
her
mother
as
the
servants
said
the
year
of
polly
s
birth
was
one
of
much
building
and
planting
at
monticello
in
february
the
master
contracted
for
three
stone
claimants
and
recorded
that
good
bricks
had
been
made
in
one
month
in
midsummer
he
said
that
were
laid
in
the
spring
among
other
acts
of
husbandry
he
added
numerous
grafted
trees
to
his
orchard
cherries
apples
pears
quinces
plums
apricots
and
bitter
almonds
in
the
fall
he
got
from
philip
mazzei
s
neighboring
place
colle
the
shoot
of
an
olive
tree
sprung
from
italian
stock
reflecting
as
he
planted
it
that
it
would
take
ten
years
to
bear
he
measured
with
exactitude
the
circumference
of
the
roundabout
walk
encompassing
his
mountaintop
and
the
distance
to
the
place
where
his
millhouse
should
stand
now
as
always
his
activities
were
unceasing
but
they
had
domestic
flavor
and
the
constructive
quality
that
he
most
liked
he
was
not
unaware
that
a
war
was
going
on
and
not
uninformed
about
its
dirty
side
his
friend
thomas
nelson
junior
who
was
closer
to
the
scene
of
military
action
wrote
him
luridly
about
the
conduct
of
the
damned
invaders
who
played
the
very
devil
with
the
girls
to
satisfy
their
lewd
appetites
and
left
few
virgins
behind
them
this
correspondent
and
others
repeated
the
sad
story
of
the
general
apathy
and
selfishness
of
the
people
rely
on
it
our
confederacy
is
not
founded
on
brotherly
love
wrote
his
friend
john
harvie
who
was
briefly
a
congressman
when
washington
was
at
forge
valley
and
congress
was
at
york
pennsylvania
harvie
said
in
great
discouragement
the
avarice
of
individuals
will
be
more
fatal
to
the
liberties
of
america
than
the
sword
of
the
enemy
he
was
sure
his
fellow
virginians
would
execrate
the
states
of
pennsylvania
and
delaware
if
he
were
there
however
he
reported
burgoyne
s
surrender
and
news
of
the
french
alliance
came
after
that
this
turn
of
events
reassured
the
naturally
optimistic
jefferson
by
the
summer
of
he
was
saying
that
all
doubt
of
the
favorable
outcome
of
the
war
was
removed
by
the
interposition
of
france
accordingly
he
thought
it
not
improper
to
employ
what
leisure
he
had
from
public
duties
in
the
philosophical
pursuits
of
which
he
was
so
fond
he
used
the
term
philosophy
in
no
technical
academic
sense
but
gave
it
the
generalized
meaning
that
was
current
in
his
age
its
closest
modern
analogy
is
science
but
there
was
a
sweeping
universality
about
it
for
by
observing
the
diverse
manifestations
of
nature
he
and
his
contemporaries
hoped
also
to
discover
the
divine
plan
for
man
philosophy
included
many
things
among
them
the
study
of
climate
and
temperature
he
was
then
carrying
on
at
monticello
and
continued
all
his
life
i
make
my
daily
observations
as
early
as
possible
in
the
morning
and
again
about
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
he
said
the
theodolite
he
had
bought
at
the
first
of
the
year
he
regarded
as
a
philosophical
instrument
by
means
of
it
he
calculated
the
angle
of
intersection
of
distant
mountains
with
the
horizon
his
mind
was
also
much
on
music
which
was
not
philosophy
precisely
but
was
one
of
the
good
things
to
be
found
in
the
vast
harmony
of
nature
he
wrote
to
a
young
italian
friend
of
mazzei
s
then
in
paris
that
music
was
the
favorite
passion
of
his
soul
though
unhappily
it
was
in
a
barbaric
state
in
america
he
was
now
longing
for
a
band
of
domestic
musicians
but
his
fortune
was
not
equal
to
that
he
had
a
gardener
a
weaver
and
a
stone
cutter
however
and
hoped
to
secure
a
vigneron
he
believed
that
in
cultivated
italy
or
france
his
correspondent
might
find
for
him
men
of
these
useful
trades
who
could
also
perform
on
the
french
horn
the
clarinet
the
hautboy
or
the
bassoon
this
letter
was
actually
captured
by
the
british
and
he
did
not
get
musical
workmen
from
europe
but
it
is
noteworthy
that
he
wanted
an
orchestra
of
this
homely
and
useful
sort
meanwhile
he
was
giving
thought
to
celestial
mechanics
in
june
there
was
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
which
john
page
and
the
reverend
james
madison
observed
at
williamsburg
with
indifferent
success
because
of
atmospheric
conditions
these
were
somewhat
better
at
monticello
where
jefferson
stood
watch
but
he
was
at
a
disadvantage
because
he
lacked
a
thoroughly
dependable
timepiece
accordingly
he
wrote
the
ingenious
david
rittenhouse
in
philadelphia
reminding
him
of
the
promise
to
make
him
an
accurate
clock
solely
for
astronomical
purposes
he
spoke
admiringly
of
that
mathematician
s
noted
representation
of
the
solar
system
known
as
an
orrery
also
he
expressed
the
personal
opinion
that
the
governing
of
a
commonwealth
did
not
require
the
first
order
of
ability
and
that
higher
and
better
things
were
expected
of
a
philosopher
rittenhouse
had
been
principally
employed
of
late
in
the
civil
government
of
pennsylvania
and
jefferson
with
the
zeal
of
a
true
whig
in
science
was
mildly
upbraiding
him
as
he
put
it
nobody
can
conceive
that
nature
ever
intended
to
throw
away
a
newton
upon
the
occupations
of
a
crown
the
geniuses
of
men
he
believed
should
be
employed
according
to
their
orders
and
degrees
i
doubt
not
he
said
there
are
in
your
country
many
persons
equal
to
the
task
of
conducting
government
but
you
should
consider
that
the
world
has
but
one
ryttenhouse
sic
and
that
it
never
had
one
before
are
those
powers
then
which
are
like
air
and
light
the
world
s
common
property
to
be
taken
from
their
proper
pursuit
to
do
the
commonplace
drudgery
of
governing
a
single
state
a
work
which
may
be
executed
by
men
of
an
ordinary
stature
such
as
are
always
and
ever
where
to
be
found
he
had
made
no
scientific
contributions
that
would
have
warranted
his
comparing
himself
with
rittenhouse
and
franklin
and
he
made
no
such
comparison
nor
did
he
claim
for
himself
the
exemption
from
ordinary
civil
obligations
that
he
believed
they
were
entitled
to
he
could
hardly
have
failed
to
see
that
his
major
public
employment
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
had
closely
accorded
with
his
special
talents
and
his
training
in
the
spring
of
nevertheless
he
talked
to
his
friend
edmund
pendleton
about
retiring
this
collaborator
of
his
who
knew
so
well
where
his
demonstrated
talent
lay
answered
him
with
neat
finality
you
are
too
young
to
ask
that
happy
quietus
from
the
public
and
should
at
least
postpone
it
till
you
have
taught
the
rising
generation
the
forms
as
well
as
the
substantial
principles
of
legislation
if
george
washington
had
been
consulted
at
this
juncture
he
would
have
been
less
sympathetic
and
would
have
laid
the
emphasis
elsewhere
than
on
the
rising
generation
and
local
legislation
he
was
forced
to
think
of
immediate
necessities
and
to
view
the
whole
continental
stage
in
the
winter
of
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
common
interests
of
america
were
moldering
and
would
sink
into
irretrievable
ruin
if
better
men
were
not
soon
sent
to
congress
writing
to
benjamin
harrison
then
speaker
of
the
house
of
delegates
he
asked
where
is
mason
wythe
jefferson
nicholas
pendleton
nelson
and
another
i
could
name
the
harassed
commander
expressed
the
same
idea
a
few
months
later
to
george
mason
when
he
again
inquired
where
the
men
of
ability
were
let
this
voice
call
upon
you
jefferson
and
others
he
said
in
his
opinion
these
patriotic
leaders
were
much
too
absorbed
in
their
own
affairs
and
those
of
their
commonwealth
the
county
lieutenant
and
first
citizen
of
albemarle
was
not
resting
his
own
vine
and
fig
tree
but
he
was
considerably
engaged
in
long
range
tasks
with
little
direct
bearing
on
the
winning
of
the
war
furthermore
to
some
people
he
appeared
to
be
indulging
his
personal
tastes
too
complacently
in
these
perilous
times
there
was
more
than
a
joke
in
the
remark
of
edward
rutledge
of
south
carolina
about
his
condescending
to
come
down
from
above
and
interesting
himself
in
human
affairs
but
his
contemporaries
did
not
blame
him
for
not
being
in
the
continental
army
entirely
apart
from
his
family
obligations
his
greater
usefulness
in
the
public
councils
was
obvious
how
good
a
soldier
he
would
have
been
if
circumstances
had
caused
him
to
become
one
is
a
matter
of
sheer
speculation
being
a
skillful
horseman
and
a
ready
writer
he
could
have
been
an
effective
military
aide
especially
if
he
had
been
as
young
as
alexander
hamilton
or
james
monroe
but
he
was
somewhat
too
old
and
rather
too
prominent
for
that
sort
of
post
he
had
had
no
experience
commanding
troops
in
the
field
he
always
preferred
persuasion
to
command
anyway
and
he
had
no
ambitions
whatever
for
military
glory
there
is
significance
in
the
fact
that
he
was
rarely
called
colonel
though
many
of
his
fellows
often
were
designated
thus
without
having
any
better
claim
to
the
title
than
he
had
quite
clearly
his
contemporaries
thought
of
him
as
a
civilian
type
no
one
who
did
as
much
as
he
to
bring
about
this
war
could
be
termed
a
pacifist
nor
was
he
unique
in
being
too
sanguine
at
this
stage
about
the
larger
military
situation
most
people
underestimated
the
difficulties
as
washington
often
lamented
but
unquestionably
his
temperament
and
philosophy
tended
to
make
him
err
on
the
side
of
optimism
he
not
only
thought
the
war
more
nearly
won
than
it
actually
was
he
also
kept
on
regarding
it
as
more
civilized
than
it
turned
out
to
be
he
overestimated
both
the
reasonableness
and
the
politeness
of
men
and
he
believed
that
even
in
the
midst
of
conflict
the
amenities
should
and
could
be
generally
observed
while
still
in
congress
he
wrote
these
words
when
necessity
compelled
us
to
take
up
arms
against
great
britain
in
defense
of
our
just
rights
we
thought
it
a
circumstance
of
comfort
that
our
enemy
was
brave
and
civilized
it
is
the
happiness
of
modern
times
that
the
evils
of
necessary
war
are
softened
by
the
refinement
of
manners
sentiments
and
that
an
enemy
is
an
object
of
vengeance
in
arms
in
the
field
only
this
was
preliminary
to
his
burning
indictment
of
the
british
for
violating
the
rights
of
nations
in
the
case
of
ethan
allen
who
had
been
captured
in
canada
and
as
he
thought
badly
treated
the
measure
of
his
indignation
was
also
the
measure
of
his
sense
of
propriety
a
no
time
had
his
resolution
wavered
but
he
assumed
that
men
would
generally
wage
war
like
gentlemen
he
even
invested
a
letter
of
introduction
of
a
young
soldier
with
a
sort
of
idyllic
charm
in
these
words
he
commended
a
recruit
to
the
patronage
of
a
high
officer
in
the
school
of
honor
the
bearer
hereof
mr
strother
jones
son
of
a
friend
of
mine
gabriel
jones
is
now
setting
out
for
the
american
army
to
share
in
the
defense
of
his
country
he
is
from
nature
well
principled
for
war
bold
honorable
modest
but
he
is
young
also
will
need
the
fatherly
hand
of
some
one
to
lead
him
thro
the
mazes
of
military
delicacy
duty
on
so
large
a
scale
even
before
he
became
governor
the
aura
of
honor
and
humanitarianism
with
which
jefferson
had
surrounded
war
was
occasionally
dispelled
the
very
fact
that
he
was
so
humanitarian
in
spirit
made
him
the
more
relentless
whenever
he
believed
that
the
rights
of
humanity
had
been
violated
this
was
shown
not
only
in
his
threats
of
reprisal
against
the
british
for
their
reported
treatment
of
ethan
allen
it
was
also
shown
in
a
case
of
treason
when
one
josiah
phillips
was
spreading
terror
through
the
southeastern
counties
of
virginia
and
in
patrick
henry
s
words
was
warring
against
the
human
race
for
a
good
many
months
this
murderous
insurrectionist
was
public
enemy
number
one
treason
was
subject
to
the
penalty
of
death
in
jefferson
s
generally
humane
bill
for
proportioning
crimes
and
punishments
and
in
this
instance
treason
was
countered
by
a
bill
of
attainder
which
he
introduced
precipitately
in
the
house
of
delegates
the
later
description
of
this
action
by
edmund
randolph
as
a
striking
and
shocking
violation
of
the
declaration
of
rights
was
not
technically
correct
randolph
was
attorney
general
at
the
time
and
should
have
remembered
that
the
bill
of
attainder
was
not
actually
employed
the
outlawed
phillips
was
tried
and
condemned
by
regular
legal
process
probably
on
the
suggestion
of
the
judges
and
there
seems
no
doubt
that
he
richly
deserved
his
fate
nor
can
there
be
any
doubt
that
jefferson
was
normally
a
stickler
for
legality
and
dreaded
any
sort
of
arbitrary
power
he
expressed
no
regret
about
his
attitude
in
this
extreme
case
however
in
the
pursuit
of
such
objects
as
winning
the
war
and
preventing
the
suffering
of
the
innocent
he
could
be
ruthless
before
he
became
governor
however
he
was
relatively
free
to
indulge
his
fondness
not
only
for
philosophical
inquiry
but
also
for
the
amenities
his
relation
with
the
convention
prisoners
which
is
interesting
in
itself
is
a
case
in
point
in
january
some
four
thousand
of
the
troops
english
and
hessian
who
were
surrendered
by
burgoyne
at
saratoga
marched
nearly
seven
hundred
miles
from
boston
to
albemarle
county
according
to
the
convention
they
were
to
be
sent
to
england
and
when
congress
demurred
burgoyne
said
the
public
faith
is
broke
they
were
known
as
the
convention
troops
notwithstanding
conditions
for
which
jefferson
was
in
no
way
responsible
were
bad
when
they
arrived
in
his
neighborhood
the
barracks
on
a
high
hill
a
few
miles
northwest
of
charlottesville
were
unfinished
the
weather
was
unspeakable
and
the
meat
provided
for
them
was
largely
spoiled
because
of
slovenly
butchering
and
lack
of
salt
within
a
few
weeks
the
rumor
spread
that
the
prisoners
would
be
moved
elsewhere
and
jefferson
soon
after
he
had
brought
his
family
back
from
a
visit
to
the
forest
took
the
matter
up
he
discussed
it
at
length
with
governor
patrick
henry
addressing
some
arguments
to
the
self
interest
of
the
county
and
the
state
but
concerning
himself
to
a
notable
degree
with
the
interests
of
the
troops
themselves
they
were
now
living
in
completed
barracks
with
gardens
and
poultry
of
their
own
they
were
in
excellent
health
and
in
his
opinion
they
had
rendered
captivity
comfortable
i
would
not
endeavor
to
show
that
their
lives
are
valuable
to
us
he
said
because
it
would
suppose
a
possibility
that
humanity
was
kicked
out
of
doors
in
america
and
interest
only
attended
to
but
is
an
enemy
so
execrable
that
though
in
captivity
his
wishes
and
comforts
are
to
be
disregarded
and
even
crossed
i
think
not
it
is
for
the
benefit
of
mankind
to
mitigate
the
horrors
of
war
as
much
as
possible
the
practice
therefore
of
modern
nations
of
treating
captive
enemies
with
politeness
and
generosity
is
not
only
delightful
in
contemplation
but
really
interesting
to
all
the
world
friends
foes
and
neutrals
for
humane
reasons
no
less
than
for
local
pride
he
wanted
the
convention
prisoners
to
stay
and
probably
he
would
have
argued
thus
in
any
case
the
fact
was
however
that
he
also
had
a
deep
personal
interest
and
liked
to
have
them
near
bashfully
because
of
the
officer
who
added
greatly
to
the
joy
and
charm
of
life
the
highest
ones
had
become
near
neighbors
of
his
the
ranking
british
officer
major
general
william
phillips
formerly
second
in
command
to
burgoyne
rented
colonel
carter
s
place
blenheim
the
ranking
hessian
major
general
baron
de
riedesel
took
philip
mazzei
s
place
colle
and
about
the
middle
of
february
his
vivacious
wife
and
three
young
daughters
joined
him
there
the
italian
was
going
to
europe
on
a
financial
mission
for
the
state
of
virginia
which
jefferson
and
others
had
contrived
jefferson
had
hastened
to
rent
colle
to
four
young
officers
one
of
them
a
german
who
played
the
violin
but
the
necessities
of
the
riedesels
seemed
greater
and
they
got
the
place
mazzei
with
his
wife
and
stepdaughter
remained
about
three
weeks
under
circumstances
of
vast
confusion
the
general
had
his
revenge
however
within
a
week
his
horses
destroyed
mazzei
s
vineyard
and
brought
the
latter
s
experiment
in
vine
culture
in
virginia
to
a
decisive
end
jefferson
regretted
this
and
probably
would
have
preferred
the
young
officers
as
neighbors
but
the
riedesels
were
a
good
exchange
for
the
mazzeis
the
exuberant
florentine
had
worn
jefferson
down
and
his
wife
was
a
person
of
unpleasing
manners
though
the
stepdaughter
was
a
favorite
of
mrs
jefferson
s
the
baron
made
numerous
and
expensive
improvements
at
colle
and
his
family
settled
down
in
relative
comfort
though
the
baroness
complained
a
good
deal
she
was
fearful
of
rattlesnakes
and
terrified
by
thunderstorms
and
as
the
season
wore
on
she
loathed
the
heat
the
baron
himself
suffered
a
sunstroke
before
they
left
they
could
hardly
have
been
expected
to
like
this
country
but
things
were
made
easier
for
them
by
their
kind
and
cultivated
neighbor
and
his
amiable
wife
jefferson
sedulously
avoided
discussion
of
public
matters
with
the
officers
but
he
recognized
no
bar
to
the
exchange
of
hospitalities
preserved
in
his
papers
are
invitations
to
and
from
the
chief
britisher
one
of
which
we
shall
cite
major
general
phillips
sends
his
compliments
to
mr
and
mrs
jefferson
requests
the
favour
of
their
company
at
dinner
on
thursday
next
at
two
oclock
to
meet
general
and
madame
de
riedesel
major
general
phillips
hopes
miss
jefferson
will
be
permitted
to
be
of
the
party
to
meet
the
young
ladies
from
colle
the
baron
afterwards
said
that
jefferson
showed
him
marks
of
friendship
from
the
first
moment
of
their
acquaintance
the
virginian
s
relations
with
general
phillips
were
friendly
upon
the
surface
and
he
impressed
that
proud
officer
with
the
liberality
of
his
sentiments
but
he
preferred
the
hessians
to
the
british
as
a
group
and
it
was
they
chiefly
who
enriched
his
life
the
baroness
who
was
stout
and
handsome
created
consternation
in
albemarle
by
wearing
riding
boots
but
according
to
her
own
account
she
charmed
the
rustics
with
her
singing
jefferson
could
hardly
have
failed
to
hear
her
he
showed
generous
hospitality
to
the
riedesels
at
monticello
the
two
ladies
became
real
friends
and
the
little
german
girls
became
particularly
attached
to
mrs
jefferson
the
circle
was
wider
than
the
two
families
it
included
other
german
officers
among
them
captain
baron
de
geismar
who
played
the
violin
there
were
special
reasons
why
he
wanted
to
be
exchanged
and
jefferson
exercised
his
good
effloresces
for
him
almost
immediately
geismar
left
all
his
music
for
his
former
host
when
he
finally
went
away
the
two
men
corresponded
afterwards
and
they
met
again
in
europe
jefferson
lightened
the
heavy
hours
of
another
young
hessian
who
was
deeply
interested
in
philosophy
john
lewis
de
unger
wrote
jefferson
that
his
greatest
loss
in
leaving
virginia
was
the
satisfaction
of
conversing
with
a
person
in
whom
i
find
all
the
qualities
which
can
arouse
esteem
and
affection
and
that
he
hoped
he
might
find
another
such
benefactor
elsewhere
the
lord
of
monticello
was
not
a
recognized
sage
as
yet
but
already
he
had
begun
to
exert
the
lure
upon
the
young
which
gained
him
so
many
disciples
in
later
years
no
small
part
of
this
attraction
was
owing
to
his
sincere
interest
in
them
and
in
their
future
course
in
reply
to
this
young
man
he
said
n
when
the
course
of
events
shall
have
removed
you
to
distant
scenes
of
action
where
laurels
not
tarnished
with
the
blood
of
my
country
may
be
gathered
i
shall
urge
sincere
prayers
for
your
obtaining
every
honor
preferment
which
may
gladden
the
heart
of
a
souldier
on
the
other
hand
should
your
fondness
for
philosophy
resume
it
s
merited
ascendancy
is
it
impossible
to
hope
that
this
unexplored
country
may
tempt
your
residence
by
holding
out
materials
wherewith
to
build
a
fame
founded
on
the
happiness
not
the
calamities
of
human
nature
another
german
officer
writing
to
someone
else
after
jefferson
became
governor
gave
a
bit
of
description
that
is
worthy
of
special
note
because
comments
of
this
early
date
on
monticello
and
its
residents
are
so
rare
my
only
occupation
at
present
said
the
unnamed
officer
is
to
learn
the
english
language
it
is
the
easier
for
me
as
i
have
free
access
to
a
copious
well
chosen
library
of
colo
jefferson
s
governor
of
virginia
the
governor
possesses
a
noble
spirit
of
building
he
is
now
finishing
an
elegant
building
projected
according
to
his
own
fancy
in
his
parlour
he
is
creating
on
the
cieling
sic
a
compass
of
his
own
invention
by
wich
sic
he
can
know
the
strength
as
well
as
direction
of
the
winds
i
have
promised
to
paint
the
compass
for
it
he
was
much
pleased
with
a
fancy
painting
of
mine
as
all
virginians
are
fond
of
music
he
is
particularly
so
you
will
find
in
his
house
an
elegant
harpsichord
pianoforte
some
violins
the
latter
he
performs
well
upon
himself
the
former
his
lady
touches
very
skillfully
who
is
in
all
respects
a
very
agreeable
sensible
accomplished
lady
in
the
midst
of
war
jefferson
conversed
with
former
enemies
in
the
international
language
of
art
music
and
philosophy
as
well
as
the
universal
speech
of
human
kindness
one
of
his
regrets
about
becoming
governor
was
that
his
friendly
intercourse
with
these
cultivated
prisoners
was
interrupted
he
was
distinctly
helpful
to
them
however
as
an
executive
when
riedesel
still
suffering
from
his
sunstroke
wanted
to
take
advantage
of
certain
medicinal
springs
in
the
summer
the
governor
provided
the
necessary
passports
and
granted
him
all
possible
freedom
of
movement
he
lent
his
aid
to
the
efforts
of
riedesel
and
others
to
secure
exchange
and
carried
on
with
the
baron
a
correspondence
marked
by
mutual
affection
and
touched
with
humor
madame
at
length
had
another
child
and
jefferson
sent
condolences
on
the
birth
of
another
daughter
also
when
the
baron
congratulated
him
on
his
election
as
governor
he
said
that
condolences
were
really
in
order
this
time
he
was
sparking
in
grim
seriousness
his
new
office
was
no
bar
to
continued
friendliness
toward
the
hessians
but
the
convention
troops
eventually
became
one
of
his
serious
problems
and
the
later
course
of
events
was
not
favorable
to
amicable
relations
with
general
phillips
jefferson
soon
had
a
more
notorious
british
prisoner
to
deal
with
than
any
he
had
known
in
albemarle
general
hamilton
recently
of
detroit
did
not
wage
civilized
warfare
and
toward
him
jefferson
was
relentless
if
he
did
not
know
it
already
he
learned
in
the
next
two
years
that
this
war
involved
exceedingly
bitter
business
the
ordeal
of
a
war
governor
xxii
the
limitations
of
executive
power
jefferson
was
thirty
six
years
old
and
a
member
of
the
assembly
on
june
when
the
two
houses
on
joint
ballot
elected
him
governor
of
virginia
he
was
gratified
that
his
public
conduct
was
thus
approved
but
he
soon
remarked
that
the
appointment
was
unlikely
to
add
to
his
personal
happiness
replying
to
one
letter
of
congratulation
he
said
in
a
virtuous
government
and
more
especially
in
tailless
like
these
public
offices
are
what
they
should
be
burdens
to
those
appointed
to
them
which
it
would
be
wrong
to
decline
though
foreseen
to
bring
with
them
intense
labour
and
great
private
loss
he
had
not
been
in
office
a
month
when
he
said
the
hour
of
private
retirement
to
which
i
am
drawn
by
my
nature
with
a
propensity
almost
irresistible
will
be
the
most
welcome
of
my
life
that
hour
did
not
come
until
two
painful
years
had
passed
at
the
time
of
his
election
his
wife
and
two
daughters
were
not
with
him
they
were
at
the
forest
making
one
of
their
frequent
visits
to
the
hospitable
eppes
family
and
the
lady
did
not
intend
to
come
to
williamsburg
soon
he
himself
was
compelled
to
spend
most
of
his
time
at
the
seat
of
government
however
and
he
found
it
necessary
to
put
a
steward
in
full
charge
at
monticello
williamsburg
was
still
the
capital
and
the
governor
was
expected
to
reside
at
the
palace
where
patrick
henry
had
followed
truculent
dunmore
gracious
botetourt
anal
brilliant
fauquier
jefferson
had
well
known
this
former
seat
of
royal
prerogative
since
his
student
days
and
at
some
time
before
he
occupied
it
he
drew
plans
for
alterations
which
appear
to
have
been
partially
carried
out
probably
his
family
did
not
move
in
until
fall
and
he
managed
to
spend
most
of
august
and
september
in
albemarle
but
during
nearly
all
the
rest
of
his
governorship
he
was
chained
to
his
post
he
established
a
home
in
a
rented
house
in
richmond
when
the
government
moved
there
in
the
spring
of
and
took
a
considerable
retinue
of
domestics
with
him
the
house
belonged
to
his
uncle
by
marriage
thomas
turpin
and
it
had
a
garden
he
was
more
fortunate
than
some
of
the
other
war
governors
of
the
era
in
being
able
to
keep
his
family
near
him
and
no
doubt
he
was
physically
comfortable
but
neither
in
the
old
capital
nor
the
new
one
could
he
reproduce
the
free
and
elevated
life
of
monticello
and
he
soon
came
to
regard
himself
not
as
a
public
servant
but
as
a
public
slave
his
fellow
executives
in
other
states
felt
much
the
same
for
they
were
all
engaged
in
an
onerous
and
thankless
task
but
it
is
doubtful
if
any
of
them
regretted
so
much
the
loss
of
liberty
on
personal
as
well
as
on
philosophical
grounds
the
political
implications
of
his
election
are
not
wholly
clear
the
bare
facts
are
that
on
the
first
ballot
he
had
a
plurality
but
not
a
majority
the
other
votes
being
divided
between
two
intimate
friends
of
his
youth
and
young
manhood
john
page
and
thomas
nelson
junior
on
the
second
ballot
page
got
most
of
nelson
s
votes
but
jefferson
got
enough
of
them
to
be
elected
the
final
tally
being
to
this
unnatural
competition
of
persons
caused
momentary
embarrassment
on
both
sides
page
who
was
already
president
of
the
council
of
state
and
lieutenant
governor
could
not
see
the
new
governor
at
once
and
soon
had
to
leave
town
therefore
he
wrote
a
little
note
which
called
for
a
reply
and
thus
left
a
pleasant
record
he
wanted
to
leave
no
shadow
of
suspicion
that
he
had
low
dirty
feelings
and
was
avoiding
his
old
friend
in
order
to
hide
embarrassment
jefferson
was
not
to
be
outdone
in
politeness
or
expressions
of
affection
it
had
given
me
much
pain
he
wrote
that
the
zeal
of
our
respective
friends
should
ever
have
placed
you
and
me
in
the
situation
of
competitors
i
was
comforted
however
with
the
reflection
that
it
was
their
competition
not
ours
and
that
the
difference
of
the
numbers
which
decided
between
us
was
too
insignificant
to
give
you
a
pain
or
me
a
pleasure
had
our
dispositions
toward
each
other
been
such
as
to
admit
those
sensations
as
for
the
constructions
of
the
world
the
world
might
go
to
the
devil
the
rivalry
caused
no
rift
in
ancient
friendship
page
remained
in
office
for
almost
a
year
and
when
he
did
leave
the
government
he
regretted
that
he
had
to
do
so
in
jefferson
s
administration
the
political
differences
between
them
soon
ceased
to
seem
important
but
in
june
their
respective
friends
divided
roughly
into
the
progressive
and
conservative
groups
which
have
been
described
already
the
former
were
more
expansionist
in
western
policy
less
associated
with
mercantile
interests
and
more
liberal
on
questions
of
human
rights
having
served
three
successive
terms
of
a
year
patrick
henry
was
no
longer
eligible
jefferson
was
chairman
of
the
committee
of
the
house
of
delegates
which
had
notified
him
of
his
unopposed
re
election
the
year
before
he
himself
was
generally
regarded
as
being
with
henry
rather
than
against
him
and
his
own
political
support
came
chiefly
from
the
back
counties
while
page
and
nelson
were
favored
by
tidewater
but
jefferson
had
not
created
anything
deserving
the
name
of
an
organization
if
anybody
had
a
personal
organization
patrick
henry
did
and
it
was
probably
a
relief
to
his
successor
when
demosthenes
retired
to
his
place
leatherwood
in
the
forests
of
henry
county
there
as
he
wrote
jefferson
he
heard
scarcely
a
word
of
public
matters
and
he
believed
that
his
health
would
never
again
permit
him
to
apply
himself
closely
to
sedentary
business
he
took
a
seat
in
the
assembly
however
before
a
year
had
passed
and
he
followed
a
legislative
course
which
did
not
meet
the
governor
s
full
approval
by
the
summer
of
at
least
jefferson
became
aware
that
the
influence
of
his
predecessor
was
something
of
a
hindrance
and
at
the
session
of
the
assembly
in
the
following
fall
so
another
observer
said
the
majority
party
was
headed
by
henry
who
carried
everything
in
the
house
of
delegates
as
he
pleased
he
not
jefferson
was
the
most
popular
political
leader
of
the
commonwealth
the
new
governor
s
disinterested
devotion
to
the
state
and
the
revolutionary
cause
not
his
political
skill
had
most
impressed
his
associates
richard
henry
lee
who
was
often
involved
in
intrigue
wrote
him
every
good
whig
will
wish
success
to
a
governor
whose
principles
of
action
are
not
the
incentives
of
whim
or
the
suggestions
of
partiality
but
who
is
influenced
by
motives
of
sound
whiggism
which
i
take
to
be
those
of
genuine
philanthropy
another
contemporary
said
privately
i
wish
his
excellency
s
activity
may
be
equal
to
the
abilities
he
possesses
in
so
eminent
a
degree
in
that
case
we
may
boast
of
having
the
greatest
man
on
the
continent
at
the
helm
but
if
he
should
tread
in
the
footsteps
of
his
predecessor
there
is
not
much
to
be
expected
from
the
brightest
talents
the
reference
was
not
to
a
program
of
domestic
reform
for
patrick
henry
had
none
jefferson
s
own
long
range
program
as
embodied
in
the
report
of
the
revisors
was
presented
soon
after
this
and
the
spirit
and
needs
of
the
hour
were
such
that
it
was
left
lying
on
the
legislative
table
the
immediate
kitchen
was
the
prosecution
of
the
war
on
virginia
s
part
and
as
this
observer
saw
it
never
was
a
country
in
a
more
shabby
situation
it
was
practically
defenseless
he
said
at
such
a
time
oratory
and
personal
politics
promised
little
unfortunately
the
same
might
have
been
said
of
high
intellectual
attainments
and
prophetic
insight
into
the
distant
prospects
of
a
republican
society
jefferson
s
own
statement
when
accepting
the
election
that
he
was
fearful
lest
his
poor
endeavors
should
fall
short
of
the
kind
expectations
of
his
country
was
something
more
than
a
polite
expression
fundamentally
he
was
modest
and
his
major
services
up
to
this
point
had
been
rendered
in
the
legislative
rather
than
the
executive
department
however
there
was
no
reason
for
anybody
to
suppose
that
he
lacked
administrative
qualifications
in
the
narrow
sense
in
which
they
were
then
understood
this
industrious
and
systematic
man
who
had
shown
such
diligence
in
details
might
have
been
expected
to
be
more
efficient
than
his
predecessor
in
daily
business
but
jefferson
could
not
have
been
a
high
powered
modern
executive
even
if
he
had
wanted
to
be
one
the
constitution
of
the
state
and
the
spirit
of
the
times
made
that
quite
impossible
his
scrupulous
observance
of
the
constitutional
limitations
upon
the
executive
might
have
been
anticipated
by
anyone
familiar
with
the
workings
of
his
mind
to
him
fundamental
law
was
not
so
sacred
that
it
could
not
be
changed
quite
the
contrary
but
until
it
was
changed
it
stood
as
an
expression
of
the
public
will
and
could
not
be
challenged
by
a
particular
official
fear
of
governmental
authority
and
its
tendency
to
aggrandizement
was
thoroughly
characteristic
of
him
most
of
the
patriots
believed
in
what
he
called
a
free
and
mild
government
but
no
one
did
so
more
firmly
than
he
and
few
were
more
reluctant
to
yield
it
to
the
exigencies
of
immediate
circumstances
it
may
have
been
his
weakness
but
unquestionably
it
was
his
genius
to
take
a
long
range
new
of
things
he
did
not
fully
share
the
jealousy
of
executive
power
as
compared
with
legislative
which
was
so
rampant
in
that
period
and
which
had
left
its
negative
impress
on
the
constitution
of
his
state
he
never
approved
of
legislative
omnipotence
and
became
bitter
about
it
before
the
revolution
was
over
but
he
was
even
more
bitter
about
the
alleged
proposals
to
establish
a
dictatorship
in
virginia
in
and
again
at
tie
close
of
his
administration
in
he
was
passionately
hostile
to
autocracy
at
the
end
of
his
own
executive
experience
just
as
he
was
before
it
began
he
was
determined
that
the
outcome
of
this
war
should
not
be
the
loss
of
the
freedom
men
were
fighting
for
he
was
no
advocate
of
anarchy
or
irresponsibility
but
both
as
an
executive
and
a
legislator
he
was
a
champion
of
liberty
under
law
at
the
beginning
of
his
governorship
he
had
no
choice
or
at
least
he
saw
no
choice
but
to
be
an
executive
in
the
restricted
sense
and
carry
out
the
expressed
will
of
the
assembly
that
body
had
elected
him
for
a
term
of
one
year
and
he
could
not
lawfully
serve
more
than
three
he
was
directly
responsible
to
it
and
he
had
no
veto
with
which
to
check
it
his
contemporary
governor
george
clinton
of
new
york
occupied
a
much
stronger
constitutional
position
and
it
would
have
been
surprising
if
clinton
had
not
been
considerably
the
more
effective
of
the
two
the
major
formulation
of
public
policy
was
not
expected
of
the
governor
of
virginia
in
during
the
administration
of
patrick
henry
some
leaders
had
questioned
the
ability
of
a
popular
assembly
to
carry
on
the
business
of
war
but
such
opinions
were
not
general
and
jefferson
like
george
washington
had
to
make
the
best
of
legislative
dilatoriness
and
incompetence
the
only
real
question
is
whether
he
did
all
that
he
could
have
done
to
correct
this
weak
situation
he
undoubtedly
exerted
influence
through
reports
recommendations
and
private
representations
but
he
did
not
do
so
to
the
same
degree
as
governor
william
livingston
of
new
jersey
who
remained
in
office
longer
but
whose
constitutional
position
was
only
a
little
stronger
than
his
own
in
part
the
difference
lay
in
the
relative
aggressiveness
of
the
two
men
as
danger
drew
nearer
the
assembly
made
temporary
grants
of
considerable
authority
to
the
executive
but
these
were
belated
whether
they
would
have
been
wielded
more
effectively
by
a
clinton
or
a
livingston
is
a
matter
of
sheer
speculation
jefferson
as
governor
was
not
only
the
creature
of
the
assembly
supposedly
he
was
guided
by
the
council
of
state
a
body
of
eight
men
elected
periodically
by
the
legislature
on
the
few
occasions
when
he
used
the
pronoun
i
instead
of
we
in
official
papers
he
said
he
was
acting
by
and
with
the
advice
of
the
council
he
did
not
believe
that
the
governor
should
merely
act
as
the
clerk
and
authenticator
of
the
votes
of
the
councilors
but
he
did
believe
that
their
advice
should
control
whenever
it
was
unmistakable
only
in
the
case
of
a
divided
vote
or
in
an
emergency
when
there
was
no
vote
at
all
was
the
governor
to
act
on
his
own
responsibility
jefferson
s
first
formal
statement
should
not
be
taken
literally
but
he
expressed
confidence
only
in
his
own
impartiality
assiduous
attention
to
duty
and
sincere
devotion
to
the
great
american
cause
beyond
that
he
said
he
must
rely
on
the
wise
counsels
of
the
assembly
and
of
those
who
had
been
appointed
to
aid
him
one
gains
no
impression
of
irresolution
or
personal
weakness
from
his
official
utterances
but
quite
clearly
he
was
more
concerned
to
be
reasonable
than
to
dominate
the
council
or
anybody
else
his
group
of
special
advisers
during
the
first
months
of
his
governorship
included
john
page
james
madison
and
john
walker
his
still
affectionate
friend
from
albemarle
he
worked
harmoniously
with
these
men
and
had
their
full
confidence
this
association
marks
the
beginning
of
his
intimate
friendship
with
madison
whom
he
had
previously
served
with
in
the
house
of
delegates
but
had
not
known
well
this
serious
little
man
was
another
enlightened
liberal
and
scholar
in
politics
in
the
time
of
greatest
emergency
unfortunately
these
particular
friends
of
jefferson
were
off
the
council
during
his
second
year
ironically
enough
one
of
his
constitutional
advisers
was
his
former
rival
jacquelin
ambler
husband
of
the
belinda
of
his
romantic
youth
and
afterwards
the
father
in
law
of
john
marshall
it
is
also
ironical
that
the
records
of
the
council
during
three
fourths
of
his
governorship
were
lost
at
the
time
of
benedict
arnold
s
raid
on
richmond
which
some
people
thought
he
should
have
prevented
from
those
which
remain
it
appears
that
he
was
diligence
itself
in
official
business
he
and
his
board
met
practically
every
day
at
ten
o
clock
and
even
when
the
exigencies
of
war
prevented
a
quorum
he
himself
went
through
the
forms
and
left
records
that
he
had
attempted
to
hold
a
meeting
the
rest
of
the
executive
machinery
was
cumbersome
the
assembly
had
accepted
the
recommendation
of
the
revisors
by
establishing
a
board
of
war
and
a
board
of
trade
these
were
subject
to
the
direction
and
control
of
the
governor
and
council
but
neither
was
effective
and
both
were
abolished
within
a
year
jefferson
had
played
an
important
part
in
creating
these
boards
but
his
relations
with
them
were
not
wholly
harmonious
and
he
shed
no
tears
when
they
were
dissolved
throughout
his
administration
he
gave
the
impression
of
unfailing
zeal
and
incessant
labor
he
had
clerks
to
copy
official
papers
but
from
the
outset
he
was
enmeshed
in
details
and
swamped
by
paper
work
as
the
war
governors
generally
were
even
during
his
first
year
there
were
vexations
enough
and
serious
difficulties
were
to
be
expected
unless
the
war
should
end
jefferson
could
not
have
avoided
trouble
if
he
had
had
far
greater
power
and
wisdom
and
it
is
hard
to
see
how
anyone
could
have
been
genuinely
effective
in
the
larger
sense
with
the
instruments
which
were
available
to
his
hand
also
this
was
a
period
of
growing
public
apathy
and
discouragement
and
at
times
there
was
actual
disaffection
opinion
about
the
war
was
more
uniform
in
virginia
than
in
most
of
the
states
but
the
work
of
the
revolution
was
done
by
a
relatively
small
group
jefferson
had
come
down
from
the
rarefied
atmosphere
of
thought
and
legal
scholarship
in
order
to
participate
continuously
in
the
conflict
this
action
gratified
george
washington
who
needed
help
from
civilian
officials
but
before
the
war
was
over
it
caused
thomas
jefferson
to
suffer
far
beyond
his
just
deserts
deep
disappointment
did
not
come
immediately
but
this
polite
and
thoughtful
man
found
out
all
too
soon
that
war
played
havoc
with
philosophy
and
the
amenities
the
reception
of
henry
hamilton
former
lieutenant
governor
of
detroit
and
notorious
on
the
frontier
as
the
scalp
buyer
was
definitely
an
executive
matter
and
although
not
the
greatest
of
jefferson
s
problems
it
was
almost
the
first
in
the
february
before
his
accession
hamilton
had
been
captured
at
vincennes
in
virginia
s
northwestern
county
of
illinois
the
captor
was
another
native
of
albemarle
george
rogers
clark
and
his
letter
announcing
the
capitulation
though
addressed
to
patrick
henry
was
actually
received
by
jefferson
the
news
was
specially
pleasing
to
the
new
governor
because
he
had
been
associated
in
spirit
with
the
exploits
of
this
hardy
frontier
soldier
from
the
inception
of
his
bold
and
brilliantly
successful
plan
to
conquer
the
northwest
jefferson
was
probably
one
of
the
gentlemen
in
williamsburg
to
whom
late
in
clark
set
forth
his
plan
to
carry
the
war
from
kentucky
into
the
indians
own
country
and
who
communicated
this
plan
to
governor
patrick
henry
he
was
a
member
of
the
assembly
which
granted
the
governor
the
necessary
power
in
general
terms
and
patrick
henry
consulted
him
wythe
and
mason
about
future
rewards
to
the
members
of
the
expedition
as
a
result
clark
not
only
received
secret
instructions
from
henry
he
also
got
a
private
letter
from
these
three
gentlemen
assuring
him
that
if
he
and
his
associates
were
successful
they
might
rely
on
the
assembly
for
grants
from
the
conquered
lands
heartened
by
this
extralegal
act
lieutenant
colonel
clark
proceeded
to
capture
kaskaskia
and
overrun
the
illinois
country
thereby
writing
a
dramatic
and
heroic
chapter
in
the
history
of
the
american
revolution
also
he
greatly
strengthened
the
claim
of
virginia
to
the
region
beyond
the
ohio
which
was
soon
designated
a
county
by
legislative
act
it
was
largely
because
of
him
that
jefferson
as
governor
was
the
civil
chief
of
this
vast
domain
the
recapture
of
vincennes
by
hamilton
who
sallied
forth
from
detroit
was
a
serious
annoyance
but
clark
retaliated
with
another
brilliant
exploit
marching
across
the
drowned
lands
he
surprised
the
fort
and
captured
the
commandant
himself
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
with
this
troublesome
officer
he
sent
him
to
kentucky
to
be
conducted
thence
to
virginia
news
of
clark
s
triumph
reached
jefferson
before
the
prisoner
did
and
hamilton
constituted
as
it
were
the
dregs
in
the
cup
of
victory
the
governor
of
virginia
was
convinced
that
the
conduct
of
the
lieutenant
governor
of
detroit
had
been
barbarous
and
he
was
no
little
embarrassed
when
general
phillips
the
high
british
officer
with
whom
he
had
exchanged
hospitalities
interested
himself
in
hamilton
s
fate
the
scalp
buyer
was
not
brought
to
williamsburg
until
after
the
assembly
had
voted
george
rogers
clark
a
sword
in
the
middle
of
june
hamilton
and
captain
william
lamothe
arrived
from
chesterfield
county
in
handcuffs
according
to
his
own
story
which
must
be
accepted
with
considerable
reservation
they
were
conducted
to
the
palace
and
stood
at
the
governor
s
door
half
an
hour
weary
wet
and
hungry
they
were
then
carried
off
to
jail
accompanied
by
a
mob
there
they
found
philip
dejean
justice
of
peace
for
detroit
two
days
lighten
the
very
day
that
the
report
of
the
revisors
including
jefferson
s
bill
for
the
proportioning
of
crimes
and
punishments
was
presented
to
the
assembly
the
governor
and
council
decided
on
the
fate
of
these
three
whom
they
linked
in
common
barbarity
and
regarded
as
war
criminals
these
were
men
of
another
stripe
from
the
british
and
hessian
officers
with
whom
jefferson
had
consorted
so
pleasantly
in
recent
months
and
the
council
had
no
thought
of
honoring
them
with
gracious
treatment
on
the
contrary
they
advised
that
they
be
put
in
irons
and
confined
in
the
dungeon
of
the
public
jail
that
they
be
debarred
the
use
of
pen
ink
and
paper
and
be
excluded
from
all
conversation
except
with
the
keeper
the
latter
was
jefferson
s
organ
playing
friend
peter
pelham
the
specific
reasons
assigned
were
hamilton
s
incitation
of
the
indians
to
perpetrate
their
accustomed
cruelties
on
united
states
citizens
without
distinction
of
age
sex
or
condition
and
his
inhuman
treatment
of
american
captives
doggone
and
lamothe
were
regarded
as
his
willing
accomplices
a
more
general
reason
which
was
assigned
for
the
action
of
the
executive
was
the
savage
and
uncivilized
conduct
of
british
officers
in
the
war
and
their
foul
treatment
of
prisoners
whether
or
not
these
general
charges
were
too
sweeping
jefferson
had
facts
about
the
sufferings
of
virginians
and
from
personal
observation
he
knew
that
british
prisoners
in
american
hands
had
been
treated
with
humanity
and
consideration
general
phillips
himself
could
testify
to
that
jefferson
could
hardly
have
been
a
passive
auditor
during
the
session
of
the
council
and
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
he
hesitated
to
issue
the
official
order
putting
these
severe
penalties
into
effect
that
very
day
in
a
letter
about
hamilton
he
said
it
is
impossible
for
any
generous
man
to
disapprove
his
sentence
on
the
next
day
he
reported
that
the
justice
of
the
action
was
confirmed
by
the
general
sense
of
the
people
the
latter
observation
was
contained
in
a
letter
to
the
president
of
congress
which
he
dispatched
with
scrupulous
correctness
and
his
confidence
that
the
approval
of
the
members
might
be
expected
was
borne
out
by
the
event
thus
richard
henry
lee
wrote
him
the
reasons
assigned
for
hamilton
s
treatment
are
strongly
and
pointedly
set
forth
his
fate
is
well
merited
another
correspondent
said
that
the
proceedings
were
received
by
congress
with
the
utmost
applause
that
the
whole
matter
was
beautifully
stated
and
that
the
sentence
was
judicious
and
spirited
unquestionably
the
sentence
was
spirited
but
the
best
person
to
judge
whether
or
not
it
was
judicious
was
george
washington
jefferson
sent
him
a
copy
of
the
executive
order
while
reporting
clark
s
success
it
will
add
much
to
our
satisfaction
to
know
it
meets
with
your
approbation
he
said
he
was
much
pleased
therefore
to
learn
that
washington
had
no
doubt
of
the
propriety
of
the
proceedings
against
these
cruel
men
on
the
american
side
there
was
little
or
no
protest
against
the
severity
of
the
treatment
but
general
phillips
speaking
for
the
british
raised
a
troublesome
question
which
jefferson
passed
on
to
washington
and
congress
did
not
hamilton
s
formal
capitulation
forbid
confinement
of
this
sort
jefferson
did
not
think
it
did
being
legalistic
in
his
turn
hamilton
had
signed
an
agreement
but
it
contained
no
stipulation
about
the
treatment
of
prisoners
he
had
said
that
he
relied
on
the
generosity
of
his
enemies
but
jefferson
had
an
answer
for
that
generosity
on
a
large
and
comprehensive
scale
seems
to
dictate
the
making
a
signal
example
of
this
gentleman
he
wrote
to
washington
he
also
replied
to
the
british
talk
about
the
possibility
of
reprisals
when
we
are
desired
to
advert
to
the
possible
consequences
of
treating
prisoners
with
rigour
i
need
only
ask
when
did
these
rigours
begin
not
with
us
assuredly
in
his
opinion
it
was
high
time
to
teach
respect
for
the
dictates
of
humanity
and
in
such
a
case
retaliation
became
an
act
of
benevolence
the
murdering
of
innocent
women
and
children
and
the
unjustifiable
severities
on
american
captives
must
stop
he
was
sensitive
about
the
charge
of
violation
of
faith
however
and
sought
washington
s
advice
on
sober
second
thought
the
general
concluded
that
according
to
the
usage
of
war
hamilton
was
on
a
different
footing
from
a
mere
prisoner
at
discretion
though
he
certainly
merited
discrimination
and
might
be
confined
to
a
room
congress
did
not
intervene
holding
this
to
be
a
question
for
the
executive
power
of
virginia
jefferson
and
the
council
however
accepted
washington
s
counsel
as
decisive
it
was
received
in
williamsburg
during
the
governor
s
absence
in
albemarle
but
his
advisers
assumed
authority
for
taking
off
the
irons
after
he
returned
it
was
agreed
that
the
three
prisoners
should
be
at
large
within
certain
limits
taking
the
parole
in
the
usual
form
unfortunately
however
the
prisoners
objected
to
that
part
of
the
parole
which
restricted
them
from
saying
anything
to
the
prejudice
of
the
united
states
as
jefferson
informed
washington
they
were
then
remanded
to
confinement
in
jail
which
he
considered
as
voluntary
until
they
could
determine
to
be
inoffensive
in
word
as
well
as
deed
washington
agreed
that
the
objection
of
the
prisoners
to
the
customary
parole
was
unreasonable
but
he
was
pressed
by
the
british
who
had
already
begun
to
retaliate
pressure
was
also
brought
to
bear
on
the
governor
in
behalf
of
prisoners
from
virginia
the
threat
of
further
reprisals
he
said
was
shocking
beyond
expression
and
he
prayed
that
these
might
be
averted
nevertheless
though
perfectly
willing
to
extend
the
privileges
of
the
prisoners
as
soon
as
they
signed
the
parole
he
refused
to
be
bullied
in
every
event
i
shall
resign
myself
to
the
hard
necessity
under
which
i
shall
act
he
said
there
was
no
trace
of
sentimental
weakness
here
in
this
matter
he
was
hard
as
iron
not
until
after
another
year
was
the
matter
settled
following
a
discreet
suggestion
from
washington
that
the
prisoners
be
exchanged
jefferson
was
adamant
about
hamilton
at
first
because
of
fear
of
his
influence
over
the
indians
but
in
late
october
hoping
that
the
action
would
have
a
happy
effect
on
the
situation
of
the
virginia
prisoners
on
long
island
he
allowed
hamilton
to
go
to
new
york
under
these
circumstances
the
recalcitrant
britisher
was
willing
to
sign
the
parole
thus
he
passed
out
of
jefferson
s
hands
and
a
few
months
later
he
was
formally
exchanged
and
went
back
to
england
by
that
time
the
governor
was
involved
in
far
greater
difficulties
and
the
troublesome
hamilton
affair
had
receded
into
the
background
of
his
mind
it
involved
a
normally
humane
man
in
embarrassing
contradictions
while
it
lasted
and
it
sharply
illustrated
the
hard
necessities
of
war
as
part
of
his
executive
duty
jefferson
kept
in
touch
with
the
military
situation
in
the
region
whence
this
notorious
prisoner
had
come
he
continued
to
support
george
rogers
clark
as
fully
as
he
could
with
respect
to
kentucky
and
illinois
however
he
was
subject
to
the
same
limitations
as
at
home
namely
the
shortage
of
men
and
money
especially
money
the
depreciated
currency
of
virginia
could
not
be
circulated
in
the
illinois
country
and
he
had
to
advise
clark
to
withdraw
to
the
kentucky
side
of
the
ohio
he
interested
himself
minutely
in
the
building
of
a
fort
below
the
junction
of
that
river
with
the
mississippi
work
on
it
was
begun
during
his
first
year
as
governor
and
it
was
named
for
him
so
was
one
of
the
three
new
counties
which
were
set
up
in
kentucky
that
year
he
wanted
the
people
of
the
illinois
country
also
to
share
insofar
as
possible
the
benefits
of
the
free
and
mild
laws
and
government
of
virginia
and
cordially
approved
clark
s
mild
conduct
towards
the
inhabitants
of
the
french
villages
during
his
first
year
as
governor
however
he
concerned
himself
more
with
the
american
pioneers
south
of
the
ohio
as
was
natural
from
the
political
point
of
view
and
probably
inevitable
from
the
military
he
was
fully
aware
of
the
desirability
of
a
successful
attack
on
the
focal
center
of
british
power
at
detroit
and
was
willing
to
support
clark
in
such
an
expedition
if
this
commander
of
the
virginia
forces
should
think
it
feasible
but
at
this
stage
he
talked
more
about
building
the
fort
below
the
ohio
and
about
attacking
the
indians
who
were
immediately
menacing
not
until
his
second
year
in
the
fall
of
did
he
definitely
plan
a
movement
against
detroit
in
cooperation
with
the
continental
forces
and
even
then
the
plan
proved
abortive
he
did
not
render
his
greatest
services
to
the
northwest
as
the
chief
executive
of
virginia
but
as
a
member
of
congress
a
few
years
later
he
made
a
signal
contribution
to
the
political
development
of
the
region
after
his
state
had
formally
ceded
it
to
the
union
and
his
governorship
was
then
only
an
unpleasant
memory
xxiii
the
frustrations
of
a
war
governor
during
nearly
a
year
and
a
half
of
jefferson
s
governorship
his
state
was
spared
the
shock
of
actual
invasion
until
late
october
he
was
physically
safe
in
the
executive
chair
in
williamsburg
or
richmond
generally
engaged
in
unspectacular
paper
work
virginians
had
met
defeat
and
death
on
the
battlefields
of
south
carolina
before
then
but
the
enemy
had
not
yet
ascended
the
tidal
rivers
and
brought
terror
to
the
heart
of
his
own
country
for
him
this
was
predominantly
a
time
of
frustration
his
humor
was
not
robust
enough
to
laugh
away
all
the
vexations
and
the
period
was
deeply
colored
at
last
by
sorrow
the
major
difficulties
proved
to
be
beyond
his
control
and
feeling
unequal
to
the
burden
that
had
been
imposed
upon
him
he
tried
to
get
rid
of
it
only
to
find
that
escape
was
impossible
this
was
not
an
acutely
perilous
time
but
it
was
an
increasingly
disappointing
one
and
danger
kept
drawing
nearer
before
the
military
invasion
the
chief
problems
of
the
commonwealth
were
the
important
but
unexciting
ones
of
procuring
money
supplies
and
soldiers
in
his
first
days
as
an
executive
jefferson
had
some
hope
that
the
crucial
financial
question
could
be
answered
while
he
was
in
the
house
of
delegates
he
had
introduced
a
bill
for
the
forfeiture
and
sale
of
the
property
of
british
subjects
with
minor
amendments
this
was
passed
and
one
of
his
early
official
acts
was
to
issue
a
proclamation
carrying
it
into
effect
in
a
few
months
however
he
had
to
inform
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
delegates
that
the
proceeds
from
sales
could
not
be
immediately
relied
upon
the
chief
trouble
was
delay
in
the
courts
he
said
drily
that
the
matter
had
been
thrown
into
a
course
of
legal
contestation
which
may
not
be
terminated
in
the
present
age
following
his
suggestion
that
something
be
done
to
expedite
procedure
the
assembly
amended
the
law
and
in
anticipation
of
returns
they
made
a
large
appropriation
to
meet
the
requisitions
of
congress
the
delegates
and
senators
were
more
hopeful
than
jefferson
but
they
were
doomed
to
disappointment
the
returns
from
this
source
were
not
only
delayed
and
insufficient
upon
their
face
worse
still
they
were
rendered
practically
valueless
by
the
depreciation
of
the
currency
at
the
very
beginning
jefferson
foresaw
the
same
difficulty
in
connection
with
taxes
for
he
correctly
predicted
that
they
would
not
catch
up
with
depreciation
according
to
his
own
reckoning
the
ratio
of
virginia
currency
to
specie
about
the
time
of
his
inauguration
was
to
the
assembly
struggled
with
the
tax
question
in
the
fall
but
by
the
first
of
the
year
the
ratio
was
to
at
the
end
of
his
administration
it
was
to
then
he
paid
for
nine
chickens
and
for
pounds
of
brown
sugar
the
inflationary
process
was
reflected
in
his
own
salary
he
was
first
paid
at
the
rate
of
a
per
year
which
was
certainly
much
less
than
it
sounded
in
the
following
fall
the
figure
was
raised
to
and
in
may
in
order
to
put
matters
on
a
more
permanent
footing
the
assembly
changed
his
salary
to
pounds
of
tobacco
he
was
opposed
to
the
financing
of
the
war
by
the
reckless
use
of
the
printing
press
though
he
never
could
do
much
to
stop
it
in
his
first
month
as
governor
he
wrote
richard
henry
lee
it
is
a
cruel
thought
that
when
we
feel
ourselves
standing
on
the
firmest
ground
in
every
respect
the
cursed
arts
of
our
secret
enemies
combining
with
other
causes
should
effect
by
depreciating
our
money
what
the
open
arms
of
a
powerful
enemy
could
not
do
some
of
the
secret
enemies
must
have
been
in
the
current
assembly
for
that
body
provided
for
an
emission
of
jefferson
hoped
that
legionnaire
could
co
operate
with
other
states
in
reducing
the
vast
amount
of
paper
money
in
circulation
and
he
thought
every
other
remedy
nonsensical
quackery
soon
however
he
saw
no
sure
hope
except
in
an
early
peace
or
a
large
loan
of
hard
money
the
best
prospect
of
co
operation
appeared
within
a
year
congress
proposed
that
the
old
currency
both
state
and
continental
be
withdrawn
that
new
notes
be
substituted
at
the
rate
of
to
and
that
these
be
pledged
by
the
faith
of
the
united
states
as
a
whole
this
eleventh
hour
proposal
was
conspicuously
championed
in
the
house
of
delegates
by
george
mason
and
richard
henry
lee
with
jefferson
s
full
sympathy
patrick
henry
emerging
from
retirement
at
leatherwood
opposed
the
measure
with
temporary
success
it
was
agreed
to
after
the
orator
had
departed
but
execution
was
suspended
until
the
majority
of
the
states
should
approve
and
in
the
meantime
a
further
emission
of
paper
money
was
authorized
this
was
followed
during
the
next
year
by
others
in
a
dizzily
ascending
scale
the
initiative
in
fiscal
matters
was
not
with
the
executive
and
if
jefferson
had
had
it
he
could
have
done
little
to
check
the
roaring
torrent
of
inflation
that
engulfed
the
continent
it
is
easy
enough
to
say
that
the
taxing
power
should
have
been
employed
more
rigorously
and
that
the
executive
should
have
done
more
to
expedite
collections
but
many
people
thought
the
war
was
being
fought
against
taxation
and
there
had
long
been
a
serious
scarcity
of
specie
in
virginia
as
jefferson
s
committee
had
told
lord
dunmore
before
the
declaration
of
independence
money
was
not
a
plant
of
the
native
growth
of
this
agricultural
country
the
normal
way
in
which
the
state
would
have
procured
hard
money
or
its
equivalent
in
credits
was
by
shipping
tobacco
abroad
but
soon
after
his
accession
jefferson
said
that
the
trade
of
virginia
had
not
been
so
distressed
since
lord
dunmore
ravaged
the
coasts
a
parcel
of
trifling
privateers
supported
by
two
or
three
larger
british
vessels
had
completely
nullified
the
small
naval
force
of
the
commonwealth
he
was
annoyed
that
the
continental
navy
had
done
nothing
in
the
chesapeake
bay
region
but
he
had
not
lost
his
dry
humor
he
observed
that
the
same
bad
luck
had
attended
the
disposition
of
prizes
even
though
they
were
taken
by
the
virginia
navy
off
their
own
capes
it
always
seemed
expedient
to
carry
them
elsewhere
a
british
prize
would
be
a
more
rare
phenomenon
here
than
a
comet
he
said
because
the
one
has
been
seen
but
the
other
never
was
occasionally
supplies
did
slip
through
in
the
autumn
of
his
first
year
he
reported
that
three
vessels
had
arrived
loaded
with
ordnance
and
other
necessities
and
the
frenchman
who
had
procured
these
invaluable
articles
was
rewarded
with
a
generous
grant
of
land
and
the
commission
of
lieutenant
colonel
in
his
second
summer
as
governor
however
he
wrote
to
the
french
minister
our
own
efforts
to
establish
a
force
on
the
water
have
been
very
unsuccessful
and
our
trade
has
been
almost
annihilated
by
the
most
contemptible
part
of
the
enemy
s
force
on
that
element
by
that
time
for
reasons
of
economy
the
assembly
had
reduced
the
navy
to
even
more
trivial
proportions
and
a
french
fleet
was
in
american
waters
jefferson
asked
no
special
favors
from
it
the
interest
of
this
state
he
said
is
intimately
blended
so
perfectly
the
same
with
that
of
the
others
of
the
confederacy
that
the
most
effectual
aid
it
can
at
any
time
receive
is
where
the
general
cause
most
needs
it
nevertheless
he
hoped
something
might
be
done
to
free
chesapeake
bay
the
channel
of
virginia
s
commerce
from
the
beginning
he
realized
that
the
state
could
not
depend
on
arms
carried
across
the
ocean
for
the
enemy
still
reigned
there
after
five
years
of
war
the
supply
remained
inadequate
because
of
the
lack
of
arms
the
council
during
his
temporary
absence
in
albemarle
in
august
acted
in
a
way
which
caused
him
considerable
embarrassment
at
a
time
when
the
magazines
of
the
state
had
been
reduced
to
about
three
thousand
stands
of
arms
lieutenant
governor
john
page
and
his
associates
detained
five
thousand
that
were
intended
for
the
use
of
the
united
states
and
had
providentially
come
into
a
virginia
harbor
the
action
gave
offense
to
congress
and
jefferson
who
was
not
responsible
was
called
upon
to
explain
it
this
he
did
on
the
ground
that
the
arms
were
justly
due
the
state
because
of
previous
gifts
to
the
continent
there
was
a
confusion
of
accounts
to
be
sure
and
he
described
this
with
genial
irony
it
is
a
fact
which
we
are
to
lament
that
in
the
earlier
part
of
our
struggles
we
were
so
wholly
occupied
by
the
great
object
of
establishing
our
rights
that
we
attended
not
at
all
to
those
little
circumstances
of
taking
receipts
and
vouchers
keeping
regular
accounts
and
preparing
subjects
for
future
disputes
with
our
friends
if
we
could
have
supported
the
whole
continent
i
believe
we
should
have
done
it
and
never
dishonored
our
exertions
by
producing
accounts
the
case
he
made
was
all
the
more
appealing
because
generosity
of
spirit
toward
the
common
cause
breathed
through
his
entire
letter
the
governor
urged
the
development
of
local
manufacturing
saying
that
the
making
of
war
implements
in
virginia
was
as
necessary
as
that
of
bread
the
state
had
established
a
foundry
near
westham
and
had
made
a
special
contract
with
one
john
ballendine
for
the
erection
of
a
furnace
in
buckingham
but
he
proved
less
a
help
than
a
hindrance
the
most
promising
prospect
during
jefferson
s
administration
was
that
of
a
factory
and
foundry
on
the
james
to
be
built
by
a
french
company
messrs
penet
windel
co
following
a
legislative
resolution
jefferson
drew
a
contract
with
them
this
company
was
also
to
have
the
right
to
construct
a
canal
from
westham
to
richmond
thus
avoiding
the
falls
and
the
whole
matter
became
entangled
with
the
claims
of
the
same
john
ballendine
who
had
begun
a
canal
four
years
before
and
completed
about
one
twentieth
of
it
jefferson
became
a
lawyer
again
when
he
discussed
the
latter
s
rights
in
detail
and
he
showed
that
he
had
not
lost
his
youthful
interest
in
the
navigation
of
the
james
his
summary
of
the
situation
was
amusing
and
far
from
legalistic
a
very
simple
calculation
then
will
inform
us
that
in
his
hands
the
completion
of
this
work
will
require
near
a
century
and
then
a
question
arises
whether
mr
ballendine
will
live
so
long
it
is
right
that
in
cases
of
such
general
importance
the
interests
of
a
few
individuals
should
give
way
to
the
general
good
full
compensation
being
made
them
in
this
matter
as
in
that
of
the
estates
of
british
subjects
he
tried
to
cut
the
cords
of
legal
procedure
and
urged
prompt
legislative
action
it
was
the
chairman
of
the
legislative
committee
who
declared
that
the
assembly
could
not
assume
judicial
powers
and
it
was
general
nelson
afterwards
regarded
as
a
more
forthright
man
than
his
learned
friend
jefferson
who
recommended
in
december
that
the
contract
with
the
french
company
be
referred
to
the
next
assembly
the
postponement
defeated
the
purpose
of
the
contract
and
in
the
end
nothing
came
of
the
plan
on
which
jefferson
had
spent
so
much
labor
this
was
another
case
of
frustration
even
though
too
little
was
done
about
the
manufacture
of
arms
even
though
foreign
trade
was
almost
annihilated
and
the
value
of
the
currency
was
approaching
that
of
oak
leaves
he
could
have
reasonably
expected
that
an
agricultural
province
like
virginia
would
be
blessed
with
an
abundance
of
foodstuffs
ordinarily
the
state
sold
flour
to
lowland
and
pennsylvania
but
crops
failed
disastrously
in
and
by
fall
virginia
had
to
purchase
from
her
neighbors
salt
which
was
so
necessary
in
preserving
beef
and
pork
had
long
been
wanting
and
there
was
little
more
wheat
than
was
needed
for
the
next
year
s
sowing
the
result
was
an
embarrassing
situation
with
respect
to
the
convention
prisoners
jefferson
had
assured
patrick
henry
that
they
could
be
more
easily
fed
in
albemarle
county
than
anywhere
else
but
he
now
had
to
write
the
president
of
congress
that
these
troops
could
not
be
supplied
with
flour
according
to
the
agreement
and
that
it
must
be
sent
from
some
other
place
the
congressional
board
of
war
chuckling
over
the
difficulty
said
that
the
prisoners
might
be
given
indian
corn
though
the
british
were
at
liberty
to
send
them
flour
if
they
wanted
to
unfortunately
not
even
corn
was
plentiful
jefferson
included
it
in
the
embargo
of
six
months
that
he
declared
on
the
last
day
of
november
by
advice
of
the
council
and
under
authority
of
an
act
of
assembly
this
extended
to
all
the
chief
provisions
both
meat
and
grain
none
of
which
might
be
exported
from
the
state
to
any
other
in
his
days
as
a
legislator
jefferson
may
have
devoted
more
time
to
the
affairs
of
his
commonwealth
than
washington
thought
advisable
but
he
always
viewed
the
conflict
between
the
states
and
great
britain
with
the
eye
of
a
unionist
not
a
localist
and
he
was
anxious
that
virginia
should
contribute
her
proper
share
to
the
common
cause
under
the
existing
organization
the
major
responsibility
lay
with
the
assembly
he
believed
that
the
legislature
made
the
task
of
meeting
the
requisitions
of
congress
its
chief
business
until
there
was
actual
invasion
and
that
it
strained
the
resources
of
the
state
in
trying
to
supply
the
men
money
and
provisions
that
were
asked
for
the
legislators
did
attack
the
problem
in
a
commendable
spirit
of
devotion
to
the
glorious
cause
though
they
were
open
to
criticism
for
the
tardiness
of
their
successive
actions
the
trouble
was
not
so
much
that
they
did
too
little
as
that
they
did
it
too
late
they
were
not
in
continuous
session
and
as
jefferson
said
the
physical
problem
of
getting
them
together
was
greater
than
in
more
compact
communities
if
he
himself
was
blamable
it
was
for
his
failure
to
call
them
more
frequently
not
until
his
governorship
neared
its
end
did
he
exercise
his
authority
to
advance
the
time
of
meeting
even
for
this
however
he
had
to
get
the
consent
of
the
council
he
cannot
be
justly
charged
with
complacency
during
this
period
but
he
was
convinced
that
virginia
had
done
well
everything
considered
he
summarized
the
whole
matter
in
a
letter
to
the
president
of
congress
in
the
summer
of
it
would
have
given
me
great
pleasure
he
said
to
have
been
able
to
show
congress
that
their
requisitions
had
been
complied
with
in
this
state
accurately
in
time
quantity
and
every
other
circumstance
he
did
not
have
that
pleasure
but
he
did
claim
that
up
to
this
date
virginia
had
paid
practically
the
whole
of
the
requisition
of
money
he
made
no
comparisons
with
other
states
at
that
time
but
he
afterwards
asserted
that
his
commonwealth
was
always
above
par
in
what
was
actually
furnished
his
emphasis
on
the
general
cause
was
even
more
notable
in
the
matter
of
troops
than
in
that
of
money
he
was
never
so
shortsighted
as
to
believe
that
the
defense
of
the
state
should
be
made
within
or
on
its
borders
a
year
and
a
half
before
he
became
governor
he
drafted
a
bill
authorizing
the
executive
to
order
the
militia
to
the
defense
of
sister
states
when
they
were
invaded
however
the
militia
were
supposed
to
serve
local
needs
primarily
and
he
like
all
other
competent
observers
had
a
low
opinion
of
their
prowess
more
effective
and
more
lasting
aid
to
the
larger
cause
could
be
given
by
troops
incorporated
in
the
continental
army
he
was
concerned
to
fill
virginia
s
quota
and
was
sympathetic
with
washington
s
desire
to
lengthen
terms
of
enlistment
in
temper
he
was
no
soldier
but
he
viewed
military
requirements
with
high
intelligence
and
he
gained
washington
s
full
approval
by
his
loyal
co
operation
he
had
to
admit
that
the
quota
of
virginia
in
the
continental
army
was
not
filled
during
his
first
year
as
governor
he
did
not
quite
say
so
but
it
was
in
this
connection
that
the
infrequent
meetings
of
the
legislators
and
their
lack
of
long
range
planning
were
most
unfortunate
the
assembly
did
the
customary
things
just
before
jefferson
became
governor
it
offered
bounties
to
soldiers
and
premiums
to
recruiting
officers
but
as
he
stated
afterwards
these
encouragements
did
not
have
the
expected
results
to
what
extent
the
failure
may
be
attributed
to
him
as
an
administrator
is
now
almost
impossible
to
decide
but
there
can
be
no
question
of
his
spirit
or
of
his
diligence
supplementary
measures
in
the
fall
again
failed
to
fill
the
quota
at
that
time
however
when
british
activity
had
shifted
to
the
south
and
south
carolina
was
in
grave
danger
greater
discretionary
power
was
given
the
governor
he
was
empowered
to
order
to
her
aid
such
state
troops
as
could
be
sent
under
the
terms
of
their
enlistment
and
as
many
as
fifteen
hundred
of
the
militia
jefferson
ordered
certain
new
levies
to
go
southward
there
were
rumors
of
the
invasion
of
virginia
toward
the
end
of
the
year
but
he
never
took
these
as
seriously
as
his
own
board
of
war
did
to
meet
this
particular
menace
he
depended
on
the
militia
his
confidence
may
have
been
unwarranted
but
in
terms
of
the
larger
strategy
of
the
war
he
did
well
in
sticking
to
his
original
purpose
to
add
strength
where
it
was
most
needed
on
the
continent
as
a
whole
late
in
november
he
wrote
to
washington
no
inclination
is
wanting
in
either
the
legislature
or
executive
to
aid
them
in
the
south
or
strengthen
you
but
we
find
it
very
difficult
to
procure
men
it
was
even
more
difficult
to
procure
supplies
for
the
new
levies
the
governor
had
trouble
with
his
board
of
war
and
board
of
trade
on
that
account
in
the
late
winter
and
spring
the
price
of
shirts
was
too
high
and
the
cost
of
rum
without
which
it
was
supposed
the
troops
could
not
move
southward
was
exorbitant
jefferson
and
the
council
took
the
position
that
the
necessary
commodities
would
have
to
be
bought
regardless
the
two
boards
acquiesced
reluctantly
and
one
of
them
said
that
the
paying
of
such
prices
must
go
near
to
ruin
the
state
the
decisions
of
the
executive
were
in
line
with
the
urgent
request
of
washington
who
said
there
never
was
greater
occasion
for
the
states
to
exert
themselves
in
procuring
clothing
for
their
respective
troops
in
this
sort
of
situation
jefferson
was
one
of
the
governors
he
most
relied
on
before
these
levies
were
in
full
motion
southward
disaster
befell
charleston
and
the
flower
of
the
virginia
troops
in
the
continental
service
at
the
request
of
congress
washington
had
detached
the
virginia
line
from
his
own
forces
and
sent
it
to
general
lincoln
in
south
carolina
on
the
last
day
of
may
the
governor
had
to
make
a
sad
report
about
these
men
they
had
been
shut
up
in
the
beleaguered
city
and
had
been
surrendered
there
the
wisdom
of
sending
virginians
into
other
states
was
questioned
more
after
that
but
jefferson
did
not
change
his
mind
about
the
supreme
importance
of
supporting
the
general
cause
and
he
retained
the
confidence
of
the
assembly
a
few
months
earlier
a
wise
virginian
in
congress
had
said
the
governor
need
not
fear
the
favor
of
the
community
as
to
his
future
appointment
while
he
continues
to
make
the
common
good
his
study
i
have
no
intimate
acquaintance
with
mr
jefferson
but
from
the
knowledge
i
have
of
him
he
is
in
my
opinion
as
proper
a
man
as
can
be
put
into
office
having
the
requisites
of
ability
firmness
and
diligence
the
legislators
must
have
believed
that
for
they
re
elected
him
leaving
no
record
of
such
votes
as
may
have
been
cast
against
him
the
summer
of
fell
between
the
surrender
of
charleston
to
general
clinton
may
and
the
distressing
battle
of
camden
where
gates
was
overwhelmed
by
cornwallis
august
after
the
former
event
and
before
he
knew
of
clinton
s
return
to
new
york
by
sea
jefferson
wrote
to
washington
there
is
really
nothing
to
oppose
the
progress
of
the
enemy
northward
but
the
cautious
principles
of
the
military
art
he
politely
intimated
that
continental
assistance
would
be
welcome
your
excellency
will
readily
conceive
he
said
that
after
the
loss
of
one
army
our
eyes
are
turned
towards
the
others
and
that
we
comfort
ourselves
if
any
aids
can
be
furnished
by
you
without
defeating
operations
more
beneficial
to
the
general
union
they
will
be
furnished
at
the
same
time
i
am
happy
to
find
that
the
wishes
of
the
people
go
no
further
as
far
as
i
have
had
an
opportunity
of
learning
their
sentiments
the
lack
of
money
cramped
every
effort
and
he
was
painfully
aware
of
the
shortage
of
arms
as
far
as
they
will
go
he
wrote
the
president
of
congress
they
have
been
and
will
be
cheerfully
submitted
to
the
common
use
washington
was
sympathetic
but
helpless
he
said
that
he
himself
was
compelled
to
see
the
honor
and
dignity
of
the
states
daily
insulted
without
the
power
either
to
prevent
it
or
retaliate
he
could
give
only
one
answer
to
oppose
our
southern
misfortunes
and
surmount
our
difficulties
our
principal
dependence
must
be
the
means
we
have
left
us
in
your
quarter
the
commander
could
not
consider
his
native
commonwealth
alone
or
the
southern
department
t
merely
he
must
reserve
his
strength
to
oppose
clinton
in
the
northern
theater
by
aiding
general
gates
the
governor
of
virginia
must
do
the
best
he
could
to
meet
the
reduced
but
continuing
menace
from
below
his
vigorous
actions
during
the
summer
were
directed
almost
wholly
against
this
southern
danger
jefferson
reported
that
twenty
five
hundred
of
the
militia
would
soon
set
out
and
that
some
state
troops
would
also
be
put
in
motion
meanwhile
in
a
region
which
had
always
depended
primarily
on
transportation
by
water
they
were
filching
all
the
wagons
they
could
collect
furthermore
the
assembly
ordered
the
raising
not
of
more
militia
as
requested
by
congress
but
of
three
thousand
regulars
enlisted
for
eighteen
months
jefferson
asked
washington
to
arrange
for
the
officering
of
these
men
cheerfully
transferring
to
him
every
power
the
executive
might
exercise
in
this
connection
there
was
some
division
of
opinion
as
to
the
proper
destination
of
these
newly
recruited
regulars
jefferson
favored
sending
them
to
gates
when
raised
as
congress
finally
requested
he
now
regarded
south
carolina
as
prostrate
and
did
not
think
it
right
for
the
whole
burden
of
the
southern
war
to
fall
on
north
carolina
as
the
fall
of
charleston
and
the
loss
of
the
virginia
line
spurred
him
and
his
state
to
reinforce
the
army
of
general
gates
it
convinced
him
of
the
need
to
improve
the
service
of
information
nearly
a
month
after
the
surrender
he
wrote
washington
that
the
intelligence
from
the
southward
was
lamentably
defective
to
remedy
this
defect
he
established
a
line
of
riders
forty
miles
apart
from
richmond
to
the
neighborhood
of
the
hostile
army
hoping
that
news
would
be
conveyed
at
the
rate
of
miles
in
hours
to
the
other
end
of
the
line
he
sent
a
gentleman
whom
he
described
as
sensible
and
judicious
this
commissioner
who
was
to
watch
and
listen
for
him
and
whose
character
he
thus
assessed
was
james
monroe
then
aged
twenty
two
a
tall
and
athletic
young
man
who
rode
well
but
did
not
laugh
easily
the
arrangement
was
desirable
in
itself
but
in
history
it
has
far
more
than
military
significance
this
sign
of
official
confidence
was
highly
gratifying
to
monroe
and
it
played
an
important
part
in
establishing
him
as
jefferson
s
disciple
the
governor
would
have
denied
the
term
master
but
there
was
a
difference
of
fifteen
years
in
age
between
the
two
men
and
at
this
stage
their
deepening
friendship
was
unequal
monroe
s
solemn
face
had
lighted
up
more
frequently
since
he
had
formed
a
connection
with
jefferson
and
begun
to
chart
his
future
course
under
his
elder
s
guidance
for
some
months
he
had
been
at
loose
ends
he
had
been
a
brave
and
effective
officer
in
the
continental
army
but
had
left
it
in
confused
circumstances
he
had
come
to
williamsburg
armed
with
a
commendatory
letter
from
washington
but
he
was
unable
to
find
a
suitable
opportunity
to
serve
in
the
forces
of
his
own
state
jefferson
s
kind
offer
to
guide
him
in
legal
studies
rescued
a
bewildered
young
man
from
deep
discouragement
and
fixed
his
ultimate
course
the
removal
of
the
capital
to
richmond
confronted
him
with
an
immediate
problem
however
should
he
remain
in
williamsburg
and
attend
the
lectures
of
george
wythe
or
should
he
accompany
the
busy
governor
to
richmond
he
got
good
advice
from
his
sagacious
uncle
joseph
jones
then
a
member
of
congress
you
do
well
to
cultivate
his
jefferson
s
friendship
and
while
you
continue
to
deserve
his
esteem
he
will
not
withdraw
his
countenance
if
therefore
he
wishes
or
shows
a
desire
that
you
go
with
him
i
would
gratify
him
should
you
remain
to
attend
mr
wythe
i
would
do
it
with
his
approbation
and
under
the
expectation
that
when
you
come
to
richmond
you
shall
hope
for
the
continuance
of
his
friendship
and
assistance
jefferson
did
not
assume
personal
command
of
the
militia
and
take
monroe
into
the
field
as
his
aide
as
jones
had
hoped
he
would
but
he
soon
solved
his
young
friend
s
military
difficulties
by
sending
him
to
the
south
as
commissioner
to
collect
and
forward
information
this
delighted
colonel
monroe
s
heart
and
in
the
fall
when
jefferson
himself
needed
encouragement
his
protege
thanked
him
effusively
in
his
awkward
and
almost
illegible
writing
though
his
private
fortune
was
small
he
declined
to
accept
any
compensation
for
his
work
in
the
carolinas
he
announced
that
he
was
now
determined
to
stick
to
his
legal
studies
unless
his
mentor
thought
he
should
play
a
further
public
part
and
he
said
that
he
owed
everything
to
jefferson
s
friendship
actually
he
did
further
military
service
before
the
war
was
over
but
the
most
important
fact
is
that
he
had
formed
a
personal
tie
which
was
never
severed
his
new
disciple
gave
the
governor
useful
information
but
nobody
prepared
his
mind
for
the
defeat
of
gates
at
camden
on
the
day
before
it
occurred
he
wrote
the
general
saying
that
he
would
send
him
five
hundred
regulars
in
a
few
days
and
congratulating
him
on
his
successful
advances
on
the
enemy
also
he
set
out
on
a
little
recess
from
public
business
after
a
long
and
laborious
confinement
when
he
got
back
he
received
from
governor
rutledge
of
south
carolina
a
copy
of
an
intercepted
letter
from
no
less
a
person
than
cornwallis
viewing
events
from
the
other
side
the
letter
said
there
never
was
a
more
complete
victory
jefferson
did
not
have
to
get
the
news
itself
from
british
sources
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
the
raw
virginia
militia
had
behaved
badly
state
pride
did
not
dispose
him
to
excuse
them
he
sent
condolences
to
general
stevens
their
commander
there
were
some
compensations
in
misfortune
he
wrote
to
general
stevens
a
little
later
the
subsequent
desertions
of
your
militia
have
taken
away
the
necessity
of
answering
the
question
how
they
shall
be
armed
more
philosophical
reflections
were
contained
in
a
letter
to
the
president
of
congress
the
scene
of
military
operations
he
said
has
been
hitherto
so
distant
from
these
states
that
their
militia
are
strangers
to
the
actual
presence
of
danger
habit
alone
will
enable
them
to
view
this
with
familiarity
to
face
it
without
dismay
a
habit
which
must
be
purchased
by
calamity
but
cannot
be
purchased
too
dear
in
the
acquisition
of
this
other
misfortunes
may
be
incurred
for
which
we
should
be
prepared
it
did
not
fall
to
his
own
lot
to
go
to
the
battlefield
to
learn
how
to
fight
by
fighting
but
he
realized
after
camden
that
he
must
make
immediate
and
even
greater
efforts
to
stop
the
progress
of
the
enemy
as
later
reports
trickled
in
the
losses
loomed
larger
not
smaller
these
included
not
only
the
slain
the
captured
and
the
deserters
from
the
militia
but
all
the
cannon
on
the
field
four
hundred
wagons
including
one
of
his
own
that
had
been
impressed
and
two
horses
with
it
all
the
tents
which
had
been
so
hard
to
come
by
and
vast
numbers
of
small
arms
which
would
be
sorely
missed
a
large
part
of
these
supplies
had
been
contributed
by
his
commonwealth
the
disaster
practically
nullified
the
incessant
labors
of
the
summer
and
forced
him
to
start
again
to
washington
he
reported
promptly
that
a
new
army
was
forming
to
serve
in
north
carolina
for
the
times
this
sounded
impressive
on
paper
virginia
was
providing
the
three
thousand
newly
levied
regulars
and
a
thousand
or
more
militiamen
including
some
from
the
piedmont
and
western
counties
whom
he
regarded
as
really
good
it
is
difficult
to
determine
how
many
actually
got
to
the
southern
theater
before
late
october
when
attention
was
distracted
by
a
threat
from
the
seacoast
but
some
militiamen
did
reach
gates
for
he
complained
of
their
lack
of
equipment
jefferson
countered
with
the
flat
assertion
that
to
wait
until
they
were
fully
equipped
would
be
to
put
an
entire
end
to
the
sending
of
reinforcements
he
sent
them
on
hoping
they
would
be
supplied
by
congress
quite
clearly
the
major
problem
was
that
of
equipment
not
men
he
reported
to
washington
that
the
troops
who
were
being
collected
were
unarmed
virginia
had
no
tents
now
there
were
provisions
in
abundance
and
he
was
busily
ordering
the
impressment
of
them
but
wagons
were
practically
unavailable
the
treasury
was
drained
dry
and
there
was
no
prospect
of
getting
any
more
paper
money
until
the
assembly
should
meet
in
october
also
a
dangerous
spirit
of
disaffection
was
discovered
in
several
of
the
southern
counties
hundreds
had
gone
so
far
as
to
take
oaths
of
allegiance
to
the
british
king
and
a
time
had
been
set
for
insurrection
this
was
in
september
next
month
the
fire
broke
out
in
another
county
a
dangerous
revolt
in
pittsylvania
was
prevented
by
the
seizure
of
the
ringleaders
in
their
beds
disaffection
was
not
general
but
jefferson
correctly
concluded
that
something
brilliant
in
the
military
line
was
needed
to
restore
the
spirits
of
the
people
he
could
not
contribute
that
sort
of
brilliance
and
nobody
else
did
in
this
deeply
depressing
period
of
the
war
his
time
was
chiefly
spent
in
issuing
orders
for
mobilization
and
impressment
and
in
begging
arms
and
tents
of
congress
the
details
of
his
manifold
activities
are
too
wearisome
to
go
into
he
was
still
convinced
that
the
supremely
important
thing
for
virginia
to
do
was
to
support
the
southern
army
he
assumed
a
resolute
tone
in
official
communications
and
he
indulged
in
relatively
few
recriminations
he
made
no
spectacular
efforts
to
inspirit
his
people
but
he
set
a
high
example
of
personal
devotion
to
a
cause
which
he
had
not
ceased
to
regard
as
sacred
at
the
same
time
he
revealed
in
private
that
he
was
unutterably
weary
that
he
did
not
regard
himself
as
effective
and
that
he
definitely
wanted
to
get
out
of
office
before
the
end
of
his
term
early
in
september
he
wrote
the
application
requisite
to
the
duties
of
the
office
i
hold
is
so
excessive
and
the
execution
of
them
after
all
so
imperfect
that
i
have
determined
to
retire
from
it
at
the
close
of
the
present
campaign
i
wish
a
successor
to
be
thought
of
in
time
who
to
sound
whiggism
can
join
perseverance
in
business
and
an
extensive
knowledge
of
the
various
subjects
he
must
superintend
such
a
one
may
keep
us
above
water
even
in
our
present
moneyless
situation
presumably
he
intended
to
get
out
before
spring
when
there
would
be
another
general
election
for
george
mason
who
had
heard
the
report
urged
him
to
stay
at
least
until
after
that
the
enlightened
master
of
gunston
hall
dreaded
the
choice
of
a
successor
by
the
existing
assembly
it
was
dominated
by
patrick
henry
a
more
violent
protestor
than
mason
was
john
page
jefferson
tried
to
persuade
this
old
friend
to
become
his
successor
though
he
left
no
information
as
to
the
methods
whereby
this
succession
was
to
be
brought
about
page
strongly
rejected
the
suggestion
saying
that
jefferson
s
resignation
would
give
him
great
uneasiness
and
the
country
much
distress
when
the
governor
repeated
the
proposal
page
again
rejected
it
saying
that
he
had
quitted
the
ship
that
is
had
resigned
as
lieutenant
governor
worn
down
and
fatigued
in
calm
weather
while
jefferson
was
proposing
to
leave
the
helm
when
the
utmost
skill
was
needed
to
steer
through
the
storm
by
the
time
this
letter
came
another
squall
was
threatening
and
jefferson
had
let
the
assembly
meet
without
offering
to
resign
page
then
encouraged
him
to
make
the
best
of
the
situation
and
urged
him
not
only
to
serve
out
this
term
but
to
accept
another
as
the
law
allowed
i
know
your
love
of
study
retirement
must
strongly
solicit
you
to
leave
the
hurry
bustle
nonsense
your
station
daily
exposes
you
to
he
said
i
know
too
the
many
mortifications
you
must
meet
with
but
months
will
soon
pass
away
deny
yourself
your
darling
pleasures
for
that
space
of
time
despise
not
only
now
but
forever
the
impertinence
of
the
silly
world
all
who
know
you
know
how
eminently
qualified
you
are
to
hold
the
station
you
hold
that
circumstances
may
happen
within
the
compass
of
the
time
above
alluded
to
which
may
require
the
exertion
of
greater
abilities
than
can
be
found
in
any
other
person
within
this
state
except
for
richard
henry
lee
who
was
too
unpopular
to
be
thought
of
page
knew
of
no
one
else
who
could
possibly
manage
the
important
affairs
which
might
come
up
and
he
assured
his
weary
and
homesick
friend
that
others
held
this
opinion
as
well
as
he
whether
encouragement
like
this
or
consciousness
of
the
difficulties
of
the
hour
swayed
jefferson
the
more
there
was
really
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
endure
the
hurry
the
bustle
the
nonsense
and
the
mortifications
while
hoping
that
nothing
worse
impended
xxiv
the
menace
of
invasion
the
character
of
jefferson
s
last
eight
months
as
governor
and
particularly
the
last
six
was
determined
by
military
events
over
which
he
had
little
or
no
control
he
adjusted
himself
to
these
with
the
best
of
spirit
but
with
increasing
difficulty
and
at
last
he
was
overpowered
by
them
the
defeat
at
camden
had
dangerously
weakened
the
defenses
to
the
south
and
he
properly
directed
his
efforts
toward
repairing
them
the
penultimate
period
opened
however
with
a
threat
from
the
east
where
a
british
detachment
under
general
leslie
landed
this
proved
to
be
only
a
landing
party
but
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
new
year
a
slashing
raid
by
benedict
arnold
from
the
coast
spread
consternation
in
the
interior
and
deeply
embarrassed
the
governor
the
traitor
s
forces
were
soon
contained
at
portsmouth
and
for
a
time
high
hopes
were
entertained
of
lafayette
s
projected
expedition
against
him
these
were
dashed
however
when
hostile
reinforcements
came
under
general
phillips
even
then
jefferson
s
own
interest
continued
to
be
chiefly
in
the
southern
theater
but
through
force
of
circumstances
if
not
because
of
bad
judgment
the
dwindling
resources
of
the
state
were
considerably
dissipated
richmond
was
again
imperiled
from
the
east
but
the
speedy
return
of
lafayette
saved
it
temporarily
from
the
invader
the
final
phase
began
only
when
lord
cornwallis
unexpectedly
drove
into
the
state
from
north
carolina
and
linked
the
british
forces
then
the
fates
pursued
jefferson
into
the
depths
of
the
forest
and
the
feeble
government
collapsed
under
the
blows
of
the
enemy
but
it
was
brought
low
by
attrition
and
inanition
before
that
time
and
jefferson
himself
though
still
struggling
valiantly
had
already
appeared
as
the
sport
of
circumstance
the
fact
that
virginia
had
hitherto
escaped
invasion
from
the
east
can
be
best
explained
on
grounds
of
the
ignorance
caution
or
indifference
of
the
enemy
it
was
not
owing
to
the
military
strength
of
the
state
which
was
so
largely
spent
elsewhere
and
certainly
not
to
the
inaccessibility
of
the
region
few
other
commonwealths
were
equally
vulnerable
on
the
side
of
the
water
this
sparsely
settled
country
was
penetrated
by
broad
arms
of
the
sea
on
which
any
fleet
could
ride
and
by
long
navigable
rivers
which
were
so
many
avenues
into
the
interior
there
was
no
real
obstacle
below
the
fall
line
that
is
roughly
the
longitude
of
richmond
this
was
well
understood
by
the
generally
unmilitary
james
madison
who
was
in
congress
and
it
was
by
no
means
unknown
to
jefferson
whose
father
had
mapped
this
country
and
who
himself
had
a
liking
for
geography
on
the
other
hand
jefferson
knew
there
was
little
to
attract
the
invader
for
there
were
still
no
important
centers
in
the
early
fall
of
he
admitted
that
if
the
enemy
should
attack
virginia
from
the
coast
in
force
the
state
would
be
incapable
of
effective
resistance
but
although
he
had
heard
that
the
british
were
thinking
of
taking
portsmouth
near
the
mouth
of
the
james
he
regarded
this
event
as
unlikely
for
two
reasons
clinton
would
hardly
dare
send
the
necessary
force
from
new
york
and
if
he
did
dispatch
it
the
french
could
send
a
superior
fleet
and
bottle
up
the
enemy
events
proved
that
he
underestimated
the
military
audacity
of
the
british
and
overestimated
the
likelihood
of
naval
aid
in
chesapeake
bay
throughout
this
period
on
grounds
of
the
balance
of
sea
power
alone
he
was
probably
not
justified
in
turning
his
eyes
away
from
the
coast
and
fixing
them
on
the
army
of
cornwallis
but
he
was
correct
in
judging
the
southern
danger
to
be
much
the
greater
and
if
in
terms
of
local
defense
there
was
risk
in
largely
disregarding
the
seaboard
major
strategy
and
the
general
interest
of
the
continent
seemed
to
require
it
in
late
october
the
unexpected
happened
then
as
jefferson
reported
in
some
alarm
to
washington
a
hostile
fleet
was
sighted
in
the
bay
we
are
endeavoring
to
collect
as
large
a
body
to
oppose
them
as
we
can
arm
he
said
this
will
be
lamentably
inadequate
if
the
enemy
be
in
any
force
it
is
mortifying
to
suppose
that
a
people
able
and
zealous
to
contend
with
the
enemy
should
be
reduced
to
fold
their
arms
for
want
of
the
means
of
defence
yet
no
resources
that
we
know
of
insure
us
against
this
event
it
has
become
necessary
to
divert
to
this
new
object
a
considerable
part
of
the
aids
we
had
intended
for
general
gates
he
added
a
depressing
afterthought
of
the
troops
we
shall
raise
there
is
not
a
single
man
who
ever
saw
the
face
of
an
enemy
soon
it
became
known
that
commodore
rodney
son
of
the
admiral
was
the
ranking
naval
officer
and
that
general
alexander
leslie
was
in
command
of
the
military
force
early
reports
were
that
the
soldiers
numbered
from
four
to
five
thousand
but
these
were
afterwards
found
to
have
been
exaggerated
enemy
landings
were
made
on
both
sides
of
the
james
but
the
cavalry
at
newport
news
were
soon
removed
and
the
whole
force
was
concentrated
at
and
near
portsmouth
the
militia
which
had
been
assembled
on
both
sides
of
the
river
were
in
a
chaotic
state
but
except
for
fortifying
their
position
and
seizing
cattle
the
enemy
were
quiescent
jefferson
commented
on
the
slightness
of
their
naval
support
and
was
quite
correct
in
his
early
opinion
that
this
was
not
a
real
invasion
he
soon
reported
to
gates
and
washington
an
interesting
bit
of
intelligence
confirming
this
supposition
early
in
november
a
british
emissary
was
taken
who
was
trying
to
get
to
carolina
when
about
to
be
searched
he
was
observed
to
put
something
into
his
mouth
that
looked
like
a
quid
of
tobacco
as
described
by
jefferson
this
was
a
letter
written
on
silk
paper
rolled
up
in
gold
beater
s
skin
and
nicely
tied
at
each
end
the
whole
not
larger
than
a
goose
quill
it
showed
that
leslie
was
now
awaiting
orders
these
came
on
a
ship
which
got
through
to
the
carolinas
and
returned
then
almost
exactly
a
month
after
their
sail
had
first
been
sighted
the
enemy
vessels
put
out
to
sea
there
had
been
little
wanton
destruction
luck
was
with
jefferson
and
with
virginia
now
said
he
to
gates
we
can
again
give
attention
to
the
reinforcement
of
the
southern
army
gates
had
been
relieved
however
and
in
mid
november
general
nathanael
greene
the
new
commander
of
the
southern
department
visited
richmond
where
he
was
greatly
disturbed
to
find
strong
sentiment
against
the
sending
of
further
military
resources
to
the
carolinas
the
governor
did
not
fail
him
but
spoke
strongly
to
the
assembly
now
in
lengthy
session
rejoiced
though
he
was
at
leslie
s
departure
jefferson
called
for
an
increase
rather
than
an
abatement
of
preparations
leslie
s
troops
might
have
gone
to
reinforce
cornwallis
actually
they
had
and
there
might
be
a
new
embarkation
from
new
york
for
the
same
purpose
south
carolina
and
georgia
now
weighed
nothing
in
the
scale
he
said
and
north
carolina
had
been
lately
ravaged
therefore
the
weight
of
responsibility
rested
on
his
own
state
he
thought
it
infinitely
important
to
keep
the
war
outside
of
virginia
s
borders
and
to
lose
no
time
about
it
this
was
good
advice
based
on
sound
strategy
he
underestimated
the
likelihood
of
future
enemy
landings
on
the
virginia
coast
but
on
the
other
hand
he
may
have
been
taking
what
we
should
now
call
a
calculated
risk
one
that
seemed
minor
in
view
of
the
situation
to
the
southward
general
greene
was
no
little
encouraged
by
the
response
of
the
assembly
to
the
strong
appeal
of
the
governor
and
jefferson
himself
after
leslie
withdrew
believed
that
he
could
meet
greene
s
requisitions
the
latter
had
brought
general
von
steuben
with
him
to
virginia
and
when
greene
proceeded
to
north
carolina
he
left
the
noted
drillmaster
behind
as
temporary
commander
of
the
continental
forces
in
the
state
and
his
personal
representative
steuben
was
popular
at
first
and
he
provided
much
needed
leadership
in
matters
of
organization
and
military
training
for
one
thing
he
appointed
colonel
william
davies
to
command
the
base
at
chesterfield
courthouse
and
charged
him
with
the
organization
and
equipment
of
the
continentals
by
the
middle
of
december
he
sent
reinforcements
to
greene
which
enabled
the
latter
to
open
his
campaign
to
reconquer
south
carolina
outwardly
things
were
going
well
and
if
jefferson
had
resigned
at
this
time
he
could
have
retired
with
honor
but
most
unfortunately
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
a
new
menace
appeared
in
the
east
he
had
not
counted
on
having
to
cope
with
benedict
arnold
and
that
hated
foe
upset
several
of
his
calculations
while
the
british
were
still
at
portsmouth
he
had
concluded
that
he
must
get
rid
of
the
convention
prisoners
who
had
been
so
long
in
albemarle
and
who
now
invited
trouble
late
in
november
the
british
of
whom
he
was
more
fearful
than
of
the
germans
were
marched
across
the
blue
ridge
and
down
the
shenandoah
valley
toward
frederick
maryland
the
hessians
remained
in
the
state
some
months
longer
but
he
finally
got
them
as
far
as
winchester
these
were
actions
of
prudence
looking
toward
a
reduction
of
military
responsibilities
more
surprising
was
his
revival
of
the
project
of
an
expedition
against
detroit
for
an
offensive
in
that
distant
quarter
seemed
to
involve
an
unwise
dispersal
of
limited
forces
and
resources
he
thought
it
necessary
at
this
time
however
and
he
was
not
one
to
let
immediate
local
considerations
blind
him
to
the
requirements
of
a
larger
strategy
he
had
long
contemplated
a
movement
against
the
british
post
where
the
attacks
of
the
indians
on
the
western
settlements
were
instigated
but
he
had
been
deterred
from
it
because
of
the
excessive
burden
it
would
have
laid
on
the
state
treasury
whether
he
could
have
secured
co
operation
from
the
continental
forces
at
an
earlier
time
is
doubtful
and
he
had
preferred
independent
action
being
reluctant
to
weaken
the
claims
of
virginia
to
western
lands
until
reassured
about
the
probable
attitude
of
congress
between
the
battle
of
camden
and
leslie
s
raid
however
he
broached
to
washington
the
question
of
continental
aid
for
an
expedition
which
promised
such
great
general
advantages
and
before
arnold
swooped
down
he
definitely
planned
one
under
the
command
of
george
rogers
clark
he
was
now
convinced
that
satisfactory
terms
could
be
worked
out
between
virginia
and
congress
for
the
cession
of
the
northwest
territory
he
had
wanted
to
guard
this
against
speculators
for
the
benefit
of
small
settlers
but
had
not
wanted
to
keep
it
for
any
other
reason
he
was
sure
that
clark
s
popularity
would
rally
a
sufficient
body
of
militia
and
under
other
circumstances
it
probably
would
have
he
asked
for
powder
and
money
and
washington
was
not
encouraging
though
he
thought
there
might
be
enough
of
the
former
the
governor
would
not
be
rebuffed
by
the
middle
of
december
he
informed
the
commander
in
chief
that
immediate
action
on
virginia
s
part
was
imperative
regardless
of
all
other
calls
and
dangers
he
had
learned
of
the
situation
from
clark
himself
who
had
come
to
richmond
and
he
issued
detailed
instructions
to
the
latter
on
christmas
day
before
he
got
another
reply
from
washington
the
reasons
for
his
bold
decision
were
chiefly
two
a
serious
secession
movement
had
arisen
in
kentucky
and
he
feared
that
if
successful
this
would
mean
not
only
the
separation
of
these
counties
from
virginia
but
also
that
of
the
entire
west
from
the
union
furthermore
he
had
learned
from
clark
that
a
confederacy
of
british
and
indians
was
then
being
formed
to
devastate
the
virginia
frontier
in
the
spring
and
he
believed
that
besides
imperiling
the
western
country
this
would
draw
off
the
most
valuable
part
of
the
militia
he
wanted
to
anticipate
this
by
sending
clark
against
detroit
with
his
regular
force
along
with
militia
from
beyond
the
alleghanies
and
a
few
of
the
most
northern
counties
thus
the
dispersal
of
forces
would
be
more
apparent
than
real
all
he
now
asked
from
washington
was
the
loan
of
certain
military
necessities
from
the
store
at
fort
pitt
the
question
who
should
bear
the
expense
would
have
to
be
left
to
the
justice
of
congress
there
would
be
immense
long
range
benefits
from
this
enterprise
he
believed
future
quiet
on
the
frontier
would
be
assured
and
an
extensive
and
fertile
country
would
be
added
to
the
empire
of
liberty
the
case
was
convincingly
presented
and
the
provisions
seemed
adequate
if
his
plan
could
have
been
carried
out
it
would
undoubtedly
have
brought
great
benefits
to
the
general
cause
and
have
prevented
a
vast
amount
of
future
trouble
whatever
the
effect
might
have
been
on
the
immediate
military
situation
of
virginia
but
as
things
turned
out
the
timing
was
bad
and
the
obstacles
were
insuperable
not
until
after
benedict
arnold
had
raided
virginia
did
he
learn
from
washington
that
colonel
daniel
brodhead
at
pittsburg
had
been
instructed
to
co
operate
though
he
did
not
let
the
intervening
events
upset
his
larger
strategy
he
detached
clark
from
the
local
military
service
he
had
been
doing
in
this
emergency
and
late
in
january
started
him
off
to
pittsburg
with
a
brigadier
general
s
commission
but
to
all
practical
purposes
the
western
expedition
then
passed
wholly
from
jefferson
s
hands
his
urgent
request
that
brodhead
allow
colonel
gibson
s
regiment
to
go
with
clark
was
denied
by
the
unco
operative
officer
at
pittsburg
and
when
he
learned
from
clark
of
the
unwillingness
of
the
militia
of
berkeley
and
frederick
counties
to
go
west
he
had
to
admit
that
any
attempt
to
force
them
would
result
in
open
disobedience
like
him
they
were
now
more
deeply
concerned
about
dangers
much
closer
home
and
they
did
not
share
his
vision
he
was
encouraged
by
clark
s
persistence
in
the
face
of
the
unexpected
difficulties
the
general
ran
into
in
pittsburg
and
he
continued
to
believe
that
victory
in
the
west
was
supremely
important
to
the
east
but
at
this
stage
there
was
little
he
could
do
but
hope
when
clark
finally
dropped
down
the
ohio
in
the
summer
much
later
and
with
a
much
smaller
body
of
men
than
had
been
intended
his
friend
the
governor
was
no
longer
in
office
and
when
he
arrived
in
kentucky
he
found
that
fort
jefferson
had
been
abandoned
the
abandonment
of
the
expedition
against
detroit
became
inevitable
it
had
been
well
conceived
and
perhaps
it
could
not
have
been
planned
earlier
but
unquestionably
it
had
been
planned
too
late
events
revealed
more
petty
selfishness
in
the
hearts
of
men
than
was
allowed
for
in
jefferson
s
humane
philosophy
and
the
affairs
of
the
west
remained
in
a
parlous
state
his
immediate
successors
in
the
governorship
were
much
less
interested
in
those
affairs
than
he
was
and
this
was
one
of
many
reasons
why
george
rogers
clark
continued
to
be
his
friend
his
vision
of
possibilities
in
the
west
is
also
one
of
the
many
important
reasons
why
later
generations
have
remembered
him
but
after
the
last
day
of
the
year
he
was
swamped
with
local
military
problems
almost
before
jefferson
knew
what
had
happened
arnold
made
a
brilliant
foray
into
virginia
this
was
damaging
enough
in
itself
but
it
assumed
an
importance
in
his
history
far
in
excess
of
its
military
significance
for
political
reasons
this
brief
period
in
his
career
need
not
be
subjected
to
such
microscopic
examination
as
it
received
afterwards
from
his
foes
and
partisans
but
his
activities
should
be
described
and
his
movements
charted
in
some
detail
besides
being
intrinsically
interesting
the
episode
throws
light
on
his
character
as
a
man
of
action
in
a
serious
emergency
soon
after
leslie
s
departure
washington
informed
the
governor
that
there
was
talk
of
another
embarkation
in
new
york
he
neither
scouted
nor
encouraged
the
hope
of
naval
aid
from
the
french
off
the
southern
coast
but
he
emphasized
the
advantages
the
enemy
would
enjoy
if
they
should
again
come
to
the
lower
parts
of
virginia
and
remain
there
they
could
move
up
and
down
the
rivers
in
small
parties
he
said
while
the
defenders
on
the
land
would
not
have
the
means
to
transport
themselves
across
these
same
waterways
quickly
enough
to
get
at
them
a
month
later
he
reported
that
a
british
force
had
actually
sailed
and
that
it
was
supposed
to
be
destined
southward
jefferson
should
not
have
been
surprised
when
he
heard
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
that
another
fleet
had
been
sighted
in
the
bay
however
the
report
sent
him
by
his
friend
general
thomas
nelson
junior
of
the
militia
was
not
full
and
he
understood
that
it
was
to
be
followed
shortly
by
a
more
precise
one
he
promptly
submitted
such
news
as
he
had
to
general
steuben
the
ranking
continental
officer
saying
that
until
further
information
was
received
he
could
only
dispatch
general
nelson
into
the
lower
country
to
take
such
steps
as
the
exigencies
of
the
moment
might
require
the
day
happened
to
be
sunday
and
he
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
call
the
council
before
it
met
in
regular
session
on
monday
morning
however
he
had
written
several
other
letters
to
officers
and
officials
requiring
several
necessary
measures
to
be
taken
and
had
given
orders
for
stationing
couriers
unfortunately
the
line
of
post
riders
which
he
had
previously
established
had
been
discontinued
for
reasons
of
economy
in
the
minutes
of
the
council
the
fleet
was
described
as
british
but
when
transmitting
the
news
to
the
house
of
delegates
then
on
the
point
of
adjournment
jefferson
only
said
that
he
suspected
it
of
being
hostile
because
of
its
size
and
also
because
of
the
information
from
washington
he
may
have
still
cherished
vain
illusions
about
immediate
french
support
and
he
appears
to
have
maintained
his
unruffled
manner
about
this
time
a
virginia
officer
who
had
foot
in
stirrup
to
go
elsewhere
heard
the
news
hastened
to
the
governor
s
house
and
met
him
walking
on
the
hill
by
the
side
of
his
garden
jefferson
then
said
that
unless
he
had
other
information
to
justify
the
measure
he
would
not
disturb
the
country
by
calling
out
the
militia
presumably
the
council
shared
his
scruples
they
approved
his
prompt
but
limited
actions
at
any
rate
precise
information
of
the
sort
that
jefferson
required
did
not
come
until
fifty
hours
after
the
first
intelligence
and
in
the
meantime
this
first
report
became
totally
disbelieved
he
said
if
this
disbelief
was
somewhat
less
than
total
he
and
his
advisers
probably
thought
that
if
a
hostile
force
was
approaching
it
was
only
a
raiding
party
the
period
was
one
of
rumors
but
in
this
instance
optimism
did
him
disservice
on
tuesday
the
report
of
an
enemy
invasion
was
definitely
confirmed
and
jefferson
and
his
board
took
action
they
should
have
taken
two
days
earlier
he
called
part
of
the
militia
one
half
from
counties
near
richmond
and
petersburg
to
assemble
at
those
places
one
fourth
from
another
group
including
his
own
albemarle
and
a
specified
number
of
men
from
the
more
distant
shenandoah
valley
he
had
already
given
general
nelson
blanket
authority
but
he
now
definitely
empowered
him
to
draw
out
the
militia
of
the
lower
counties
in
any
way
that
he
thought
proper
he
wrote
nelson
direct
telling
him
that
he
intended
to
put
militia
in
the
field
he
sent
the
orders
to
the
various
county
lieutenants
by
members
of
the
assembly
who
were
returning
home
after
adjournment
if
not
the
best
of
messengers
they
were
probably
as
good
as
were
available
they
might
have
moved
faster
had
they
known
they
had
benedict
arnold
to
contend
with
jefferson
also
wrote
to
other
persons
apparently
missing
nobody
who
was
important
plans
were
also
made
for
the
removal
of
stores
if
this
should
prove
necessary
all
this
was
on
tuesday
it
was
a
busy
day
on
wednesday
night
he
learned
that
the
enemy
were
at
anchor
opposite
jamestown
but
they
did
not
land
and
proceed
against
williamsburg
as
expected
it
was
afterwards
reported
that
chancellor
wythe
and
one
or
two
other
old
gentlemen
were
shooting
partridges
near
the
riverbank
and
took
a
shot
at
the
enemy
favored
by
wind
and
tide
arnold
decided
to
go
farther
by
water
jefferson
did
not
know
how
far
as
yet
but
on
thursday
after
he
had
received
a
report
at
a
m
and
had
been
advised
by
the
council
he
called
all
militia
from
the
counties
centering
in
richmond
and
petersburg
both
of
which
were
threatened
the
need
was
so
pressing
that
he
asked
them
to
come
in
small
detachments
without
waiting
to
form
companies
it
was
already
obvious
however
that
they
were
not
going
to
arrive
in
sufficient
number
to
form
an
effective
defense
for
the
capital
accordingly
he
gave
orders
to
withdraw
arms
military
stores
and
important
records
to
the
foundry
five
or
six
miles
up
the
river
near
west
ham
he
did
not
yet
know
that
this
was
arnold
s
chief
physical
objective
about
sunset
he
learned
that
the
british
had
landed
at
westover
north
of
the
james
and
he
then
properly
concluded
that
they
were
making
for
richmond
he
promptly
ordered
the
stores
which
were
still
there
and
those
that
were
being
carried
up
the
river
to
be
taken
across
it
at
having
remained
in
the
capital
quite
as
long
as
was
prudent
he
set
out
for
westham
to
supervise
the
operations
there
in
person
until
eleven
or
twelve
the
erstwhile
philosopher
of
monticello
gave
his
attention
and
direction
to
the
safeguarding
of
the
public
property
then
saying
that
he
would
cross
the
river
in
the
morning
and
make
the
necessary
arrangements
for
transportation
on
the
other
side
he
went
on
to
tuckahoe
for
the
night
his
family
had
gone
ahead
and
on
friday
he
sent
them
on
to
fine
creek
where
he
had
inherited
a
place
from
his
father
on
that
day
at
p
m
the
enemy
entered
richmond
in
triumph
a
detachment
went
on
to
the
foundry
destroyed
it
and
did
other
damage
and
then
returned
to
the
capital
jefferson
was
at
westham
for
a
time
that
day
but
the
british
did
not
see
him
he
saw
them
in
richmond
however
from
manchester
across
the
river
his
horse
failing
him
after
all
this
riding
he
borrowed
another
and
tried
vainly
to
see
general
steuben
under
whose
command
he
placed
all
the
militia
this
can
hardly
be
dismissed
as
a
case
of
passing
the
buck
for
it
was
a
wise
action
if
belated
he
missed
the
baron
at
several
places
though
he
rode
over
much
the
same
ground
for
two
days
he
spent
saturday
night
with
his
family
at
fine
creek
but
otherwise
was
wholly
occupied
with
public
matters
at
westham
manchester
and
elsewhere
riding
incessantly
through
snow
and
rain
on
sunday
when
he
was
again
in
manchester
the
enemy
retired
from
the
capital
this
was
one
week
after
he
had
heard
of
an
approaching
fleet
early
monday
morning
he
was
back
in
his
official
seat
on
wednesday
the
enemy
fell
down
the
river
toward
portsmouth
where
for
some
weeks
they
stayed
catching
his
breath
after
this
startlingly
rapid
affair
he
reported
events
to
washington
and
the
president
of
congress
with
customary
conscientiousness
the
troops
commanded
by
the
parricide
arnold
amounted
to
some
infantrymen
and
from
to
horsemen
he
said
opposed
to
them
in
the
neighborhood
of
richmond
had
been
only
about
militiamen
though
these
were
now
much
more
numerous
especially
on
the
south
side
of
the
james
general
steuben
a
zealous
friend
descended
from
the
dignity
of
his
proper
command
to
direct
our
smallest
movements
he
said
his
vigilance
prevented
the
enemy
from
crossing
the
river
which
might
have
been
fatal
as
he
summed
up
the
losses
afterwards
he
comforted
himself
that
they
had
been
less
than
might
have
been
expected
in
richmond
there
were
no
permanent
public
buildings
to
be
destroyed
since
none
had
yet
been
built
the
invaders
overlooked
the
frame
structure
at
the
corner
of
fourteenth
and
cary
streets
where
the
assembly
met
the
legislators
were
not
there
and
the
streets
were
not
filled
with
the
saddled
horses
which
made
the
place
look
like
an
arabian
village
in
times
of
session
apparently
the
invaders
harmed
neither
the
governor
s
rented
house
nor
the
single
story
brick
building
on
the
hill
behind
it
where
the
council
sat
nearly
everything
else
in
the
straggling
town
was
built
of
wood
most
of
the
public
stores
that
were
movable
had
been
transported
in
considerable
confusion
undoubtedly
but
with
celerity
the
chief
damage
was
up
the
river
where
the
boring
mill
and
magazine
were
destroyed
and
the
roof
of
the
foundry
was
burned
though
the
chimney
stacks
and
furnaces
of
the
latter
were
uninjured
some
stores
were
lost
chiefly
leather
but
most
of
the
firearms
were
afterwards
recovered
from
the
water
and
jefferson
believed
that
much
of
the
gunpowder
which
had
been
thrown
into
the
canal
could
be
saved
by
re
manufacturing
the
loss
which
jefferson
s
friends
felt
most
called
upon
to
explain
in
later
years
was
that
of
important
public
records
including
those
of
the
council
a
sad
mistake
was
made
by
some
wagoners
who
lodged
these
papers
in
the
magazine
instead
of
placing
them
at
the
landing
on
the
river
they
could
not
be
moved
again
before
the
enemy
swooped
down
the
british
did
not
know
how
effectively
they
were
destroying
the
governor
s
record
he
went
to
great
pains
afterwards
to
procure
copies
of
letters
from
the
recipients
and
there
can
be
no
question
of
his
unremitting
personal
efforts
to
preserve
the
public
property
years
later
a
supporter
explained
why
he
went
into
day
by
day
details
of
the
governor
s
movements
during
arnold
s
raid
for
we
wish
any
man
who
can
discover
the
slightest
remissness
in
these
movements
to
lay
his
finger
upon
the
point
and
say
when
and
where
it
was
it
would
be
difficult
indeed
to
find
any
remissness
in
jefferson
s
movements
or
actions
from
the
moment
that
the
report
of
the
invasion
was
confirmed
the
only
real
question
is
that
of
his
delay
in
recognizing
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
he
himself
was
of
the
opinion
soon
after
the
event
that
if
the
militia
had
been
called
two
days
earlier
arnold
might
never
have
got
to
richmond
and
he
blamed
the
loss
of
those
two
days
on
faulty
intelligence
this
defect
he
immediately
tried
to
correct
but
he
never
explained
satisfactorily
his
failure
to
interpret
more
realistically
the
intelligence
he
did
receive
his
later
references
to
his
original
doubts
about
the
status
of
the
fleet
in
the
bay
were
not
emphatic
nor
were
they
to
any
considerable
degree
recriminatory
but
at
this
distance
they
seem
disingenuous
they
do
not
quite
ring
true
they
are
a
little
less
though
not
much
less
than
candid
it
would
have
been
better
if
he
had
admitted
the
unvarnished
truth
arnold
had
caught
him
off
his
guard
it
would
have
been
better
if
he
had
erred
on
the
side
of
self
reproach
and
had
assumed
more
than
his
proportionate
share
of
blame
just
as
he
had
shouldered
more
than
his
share
of
labor
neither
civil
nor
military
officials
often
do
that
but
such
an
attitude
would
have
been
in
character
with
the
high
minded
and
personally
disinterested
public
official
that
he
was
he
could
have
stood
on
his
record
as
a
whole
without
attempting
to
excuse
himself
even
by
implication
or
as
so
many
lesser
men
would
have
done
he
might
have
burst
forth
in
fierce
indignation
against
others
who
were
more
at
fault
than
he
and
then
have
stopped
thinking
about
the
matter
actually
he
did
neither
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
had
vengeful
feelings
toward
benedict
arnold
whom
he
regarded
as
the
greatest
of
all
traitors
and
would
have
liked
to
see
captured
and
exhibited
as
a
public
spectacle
of
infamy
but
when
dealing
with
colleagues
whose
good
will
he
had
no
reason
to
suspect
he
was
rarely
denunciatory
he
was
characteristically
polite
regardful
of
others
and
slow
to
anger
on
the
other
hand
he
was
too
proud
and
sensitive
to
endure
criticism
and
reproach
in
self
forgetful
silence
he
received
censure
in
unmerited
degree
later
on
meanwhile
he
had
words
of
comfort
from
the
person
who
was
best
able
to
view
the
situation
as
a
whole
washington
agreed
that
the
experience
had
been
mortifying
but
considering
the
geography
of
virginia
wondered
that
the
state
had
been
molested
so
little
he
feared
similar
experiences
in
the
future
but
regarded
the
evils
to
be
apprehended
from
these
predatory
expeditions
as
relatively
small
they
were
not
to
be
compared
with
the
injury
to
the
common
cause
and
to
virginia
itself
that
would
result
from
the
conquest
of
the
region
to
the
south
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
in
his
mind
that
the
policy
of
this
highly
vulnerable
state
should
be
to
keep
the
weight
of
the
war
at
a
distance
the
principal
object
of
arnold
s
operations
had
been
to
make
a
diversion
in
favor
of
cornwallis
and
the
surest
way
to
get
rid
of
him
was
to
show
him
by
the
continued
reinforcement
of
general
greene
that
he
had
failed
of
his
intention
in
other
words
jefferson
s
own
major
policies
were
right
and
should
be
continued
if
he
had
committed
a
military
sin
and
the
wise
and
magnanimous
general
did
not
even
imply
that
he
had
this
was
a
venial
sin
not
mortal
a
much
more
severe
military
critic
whom
jefferson
had
to
cope
with
at
this
stage
was
general
von
steuben
who
had
been
greatly
annoyed
by
the
delay
and
confusion
of
the
mobilization
who
regarded
the
war
commissioner
colonel
george
muter
as
incompetent
and
who
believed
that
things
were
done
better
in
new
jersey
under
governor
william
livingston
than
in
virginia
under
governor
thomas
jefferson
the
former
prussian
staff
officer
was
determined
that
the
shame
and
disgrace
of
arnold
s
virtually
unopposed
raid
should
not
be
repeated
and
in
trying
to
carry
out
one
of
his
cherished
plans
he
soon
became
engaged
in
altercation
with
the
champion
of
self
government
in
important
respects
the
episode
was
revealing
before
arnold
came
steuben
had
recommended
the
fortification
of
a
bend
of
the
river
below
richmond
at
a
place
called
hood
s
and
he
believed
that
this
would
have
been
a
considerable
obstacle
to
the
invader
jefferson
had
punctiliously
referred
the
matter
to
the
assembly
but
that
body
had
found
no
time
to
consider
it
before
adjournment
after
both
the
legislators
and
raiders
had
gone
steuben
brought
up
the
matter
again
whereupon
the
governor
and
council
assumed
the
authority
to
approve
the
proposal
steuben
quite
naturally
thought
they
might
have
done
this
in
the
first
place
even
now
they
were
much
too
dilatory
from
the
point
of
view
of
frederick
the
great
s
disciple
and
a
sharp
exchange
of
letters
ensued
there
had
been
a
serious
misunderstanding
between
the
general
and
the
civilian
officials
about
the
methods
of
procuring
the
necessary
labor
steuben
wanted
to
summon
in
neighboring
militiamen
regarding
them
as
soldiers
under
orders
or
he
wanted
negroes
as
substitutes
to
his
brusque
demand
the
governor
raised
firm
legal
objections
the
executives
have
not
by
the
laws
of
this
state
any
power
to
call
a
freeman
to
labor
even
for
the
public
without
his
consent
nor
a
slave
without
that
of
his
master
he
said
therefore
voluntary
labor
must
be
hired
quickly
if
possible
but
slowly
if
necessary
in
supreme
disgust
steuben
wrote
to
washington
the
executive
power
is
so
confined
that
the
governor
has
it
not
in
his
power
to
procure
me
negroes
to
work
at
hood
s
in
military
terms
this
was
a
reductio
ad
absurdum
indeed
in
military
terms
this
unprofessional
war
waged
in
fits
and
starts
by
temporary
soldiers
was
little
less
than
that
jefferson
himself
never
succeeded
in
resolving
the
contradiction
his
ingenious
mind
finally
figured
out
a
way
to
get
around
the
legal
limitations
upon
the
employment
of
the
militia
in
fatigue
duty
but
he
did
not
get
the
fortifications
erected
soon
enough
to
delay
the
next
invasion
and
in
his
last
message
to
the
assembly
he
posed
the
vexing
question
of
employing
freemen
and
slaves
in
necessary
military
works
at
a
time
when
the
currency
was
worthless
it
was
the
militia
he
said
who
environed
arnold
at
portsmouth
and
prevented
that
bold
soldier
from
making
any
other
raids
for
upwards
of
two
months
not
until
late
march
did
british
reinforcements
come
and
create
new
dangers
meanwhile
the
situation
was
disturbing
enough
to
cause
the
governor
to
advance
the
date
of
the
assembly
to
march
despite
the
inconvenience
to
the
members
his
explanation
was
entirely
adequate
one
army
of
our
enemies
lodged
within
our
country
another
pointing
towards
it
without
a
shilling
in
the
public
coffers
was
a
situation
in
which
it
was
impossible
to
rest
the
safety
of
the
state
the
emissions
of
paper
money
ordered
or
permitted
by
the
last
assembly
and
amounting
to
more
than
had
been
dispensed
as
fast
as
they
came
off
the
printing
press
and
many
urgent
calls
had
not
yet
been
answered
these
facts
may
be
cited
against
later
allegations
that
jefferson
as
governor
was
foolishly
economical
despite
dangers
and
difficulties
reinforcements
had
gone
to
general
greene
these
consisted
chiefly
of
militia
from
the
western
counties
whom
jefferson
always
considered
as
virginia
s
best
those
counties
had
been
drawn
on
as
little
as
possible
for
the
operations
around
portsmouth
the
governor
was
still
wondering
about
the
best
way
to
raise
troops
to
meet
all
the
calls
on
him
he
would
have
preferred
to
rely
on
regulars
and
he
deeply
regretted
the
interference
with
drafting
operations
which
had
resulted
from
calling
the
militia
in
such
numbers
from
so
many
counties
in
any
case
where
the
manpower
had
been
drained
from
a
county
and
the
filling
of
a
levy
seemed
impracticable
he
was
forced
to
exercise
his
authority
to
suspend
drafting
this
was
one
reason
why
he
waited
as
long
as
he
could
before
calling
out
the
militia
he
did
not
like
the
existing
system
or
lack
of
system
he
told
the
assembly
whether
it
be
practicable
to
raise
and
maintain
a
sufficient
number
of
regulars
to
carry
on
the
war
is
a
question
that
it
would
be
burdensome
is
undoubted
yet
it
is
perhaps
as
certain
that
no
possible
mode
of
carrying
it
on
can
be
so
expensive
to
the
public
and
so
distressing
and
disgusting
to
individuals
as
by
militia
his
concern
for
individuals
did
not
go
to
the
point
of
condoning
avoidance
of
militia
duty
or
resistance
to
drafting
or
impressment
whenever
the
spirit
of
disobedience
appeared
he
favored
subduing
it
immediately
laws
made
by
common
consent
must
not
be
trampled
on
by
individuals
he
said
but
he
regarded
militiamen
as
civilians
who
had
been
drawn
from
their
farms
and
homes
to
do
temporary
service
in
local
emergencies
they
should
not
be
sent
to
a
distance
they
should
not
they
could
not
be
kept
in
armies
very
long
perhaps
he
was
too
solicitous
but
he
had
to
be
realistic
the
men
who
were
serving
around
portsmouth
were
being
kept
beyond
their
time
for
a
purpose
although
he
did
not
speak
of
it
publicly
there
was
a
definite
plan
to
catch
the
traitor
if
it
could
have
been
carried
out
his
governorship
would
have
been
regarded
then
and
thereafter
as
definitely
successful
at
last
french
naval
support
in
the
chesapeake
bay
region
promised
to
be
something
more
than
a
figment
of
jefferson
s
imagination
heeding
the
request
of
the
virginia
delegation
in
congress
the
french
minister
la
luzerne
urged
admiral
destouches
to
send
a
few
ships
from
newport
to
check
arnold
by
late
february
a
man
of
war
and
some
smaller
vessels
actually
arrived
though
they
did
not
stay
long
meanwhile
washington
had
formed
a
plan
for
lafayette
to
operate
in
conjunction
with
a
larger
naval
force
before
the
middle
of
march
the
marquis
got
his
detachment
as
far
south
as
annapolis
and
he
himself
went
on
to
yorktown
and
williamsburg
to
consult
the
military
authorities
in
virginia
he
and
the
governor
did
not
see
each
other
this
time
but
the
letters
they
exchanged
marked
the
beginning
of
a
lifelong
correspondence
and
heralded
an
historic
friendship
certain
sentences
in
jefferson
s
welcoming
letter
are
particularly
revealing
modestly
and
realistically
he
wrote
i
trust
that
your
future
acquaintance
with
the
executive
of
the
state
will
evince
to
you
that
among
their
faults
is
not
to
be
counted
a
want
of
disposition
to
second
the
views
of
the
commander
against
our
common
enemy
we
are
too
much
interested
in
the
present
scene
and
have
too
much
at
stake
to
leave
a
doubt
on
that
head
mild
laws
a
people
not
used
to
war
and
prompt
obedience
a
want
of
the
provisions
of
war
means
of
procuring
them
render
our
efforts
often
ineffectual
oblige
us
to
temporise
and
when
we
cannot
accomplish
an
object
in
one
way
to
attempt
it
in
another
these
limiting
circumstances
he
wanted
lafayette
to
know
a
couple
of
days
later
he
understated
the
case
by
saying
that
he
had
to
reduce
his
own
expectations
at
times
i
know
he
added
that
you
will
be
satisfied
to
make
the
most
of
an
unprepared
people
who
have
the
war
now
for
the
first
time
seriously
fixed
in
their
country
and
have
therefore
all
those
habits
to
acquire
which
their
northern
brethren
had
in
the
year
and
which
they
have
purchased
at
so
great
an
expence
fortunately
lafayette
was
already
used
to
the
inconveniences
arising
from
popular
government
and
believed
that
these
were
compensated
by
numberless
blessings
he
was
reluctant
to
sign
impressing
warrants
for
horses
much
as
he
needed
them
and
he
wanted
to
be
informed
of
the
exact
state
of
the
militia
laws
delighted
to
find
a
foreign
officer
who
appreciated
conditions
in
civilian
america
jefferson
hastened
to
say
that
under
existing
conditions
impressment
of
property
was
indispensable
and
that
he
had
no
fear
of
lafayette
s
exercise
of
these
powers
washington
s
letter
of
introduction
forwarded
at
this
late
date
was
not
really
needed
quite
obviously
these
two
men
were
going
to
like
each
other
to
steuben
the
governor
spoke
much
to
the
same
effect
but
in
a
quite
different
tone
the
baron
angered
because
of
the
failure
to
obtain
the
expected
men
supplies
and
horses
for
lafayette
s
expedition
complained
bitterly
to
jefferson
asking
that
his
letter
be
laid
before
the
assembly
in
reply
after
summarizing
his
orders
to
the
county
authorities
about
the
militia
the
governor
said
we
can
only
be
answerable
for
the
orders
we
give
and
not
for
the
execution
if
they
are
disobeyed
in
the
counties
from
obstinacy
of
spirit
or
want
of
coercion
in
the
laws
it
is
not
our
fault
we
have
done
what
alone
remained
for
us
to
do
in
such
case
we
have
ordered
other
militia
from
other
counties
in
the
matter
of
horses
the
quartermaster
applied
for
militia
to
aid
him
in
executing
his
powers
of
impressment
this
request
jefferson
denied
we
did
not
think
proper
to
resign
ourselves
and
our
country
implicitly
to
the
demands
of
a
quartermaster
he
said
but
thought
we
had
some
right
of
judgment
left
to
us
we
know
that
an
armed
force
to
impress
horses
was
as
unnecessary
as
it
was
new
nothing
caused
quite
so
much
irritation
as
the
seizure
of
horses
and
jefferson
soon
was
directed
by
the
assembly
to
authorize
county
lieutenants
to
restrain
this
form
of
impressment
he
wrote
to
general
greene
as
tedious
as
is
the
operation
of
reasoning
with
every
individual
on
whom
we
are
obliged
to
exercise
disagreeable
powers
yet
free
people
think
they
have
a
right
to
an
explanation
of
the
circumstances
which
give
rise
to
the
necessity
under
which
they
suffer
so
far
as
lafayette
s
expedition
was
concerned
all
this
turned
out
to
be
much
ado
about
nothing
for
the
expected
naval
aid
did
not
come
the
fleet
that
sailed
into
the
bay
in
late
march
was
not
french
but
british
the
event
which
was
so
fateful
to
governor
jefferson
hung
by
a
hair
not
knowing
that
there
had
been
a
naval
battle
he
tried
hard
to
inform
his
allies
of
the
presence
of
the
foe
only
to
learn
afterwards
that
destouches
though
claiming
a
victory
had
gone
back
to
newport
reinforcements
soon
came
to
arnold
under
general
william
phillips
jefferson
s
former
neighbor
who
as
an
exchanged
prisoner
had
returned
to
the
fight
lafayette
forced
to
abandon
the
expedition
went
back
to
annapolis
and
then
to
head
of
elk
jefferson
would
have
shared
the
glory
if
the
marquis
had
caught
arnold
but
he
could
claim
none
when
cornwallis
surrendered
at
yorktown
after
he
himself
had
retired
he
might
have
shared
the
credit
of
another
enterprise
which
steuben
conceived
and
lafayette
approved
before
he
left
the
baron
boldly
proposed
that
he
march
immediately
with
two
thousand
picked
militia
to
join
greene
the
supposition
being
that
with
this
reinforcement
the
latter
would
be
able
to
defeat
cornwallis
decisively
richard
henry
lee
regarded
this
as
a
master
stroke
general
weedon
of
the
militia
thought
it
would
practically
terminate
the
war
and
no
less
an
authority
than
george
washington
believed
that
if
carried
out
it
would
probably
have
ruined
cornwallis
from
what
jefferson
himself
said
about
the
strategy
of
the
war
he
might
have
been
expected
to
approve
the
proposal
almost
a
month
later
when
the
local
situation
was
still
precarious
he
wrote
lafayette
that
so
long
as
greene
was
kept
superior
to
cornwallis
virginia
really
had
little
to
fear
what
he
was
most
afraid
of
was
what
the
british
themselves
hoped
namely
that
they
would
be
able
to
rally
loyalists
and
other
disaffected
elements
in
the
south
the
british
force
may
harass
and
distress
us
greatly
he
said
but
the
carolinas
alone
can
subdue
us
we
therefore
think
it
our
first
interest
to
keep
them
under
in
that
quarter
considering
the
war
in
our
own
country
but
as
a
secondary
object
he
regarded
the
militia
left
in
the
state
as
only
a
defensive
force
frankly
recognizing
the
probability
that
they
could
do
little
more
than
impede
the
enemy
it
is
possible
that
the
governor
was
overborne
by
his
council
when
they
considered
steuben
s
proposal
but
just
as
he
would
have
been
condemned
if
it
had
been
accepted
and
then
followed
by
local
disaster
so
he
must
bear
the
blame
for
its
unfortunate
rejection
he
and
his
advisers
recognized
that
the
plan
was
founded
on
very
probable
principles
but
now
that
the
enemy
had
been
reinforced
at
portsmouth
they
were
unwilling
to
weaken
local
defenses
further
the
detachment
which
steuben
wanted
would
take
so
large
a
proportion
of
the
available
arms
that
the
remaining
militia
in
the
east
would
be
practically
powerless
the
best
they
could
offer
therefore
was
the
speediest
possible
reinforcement
of
greene
from
the
piedmont
and
southwestern
counties
where
there
was
reason
to
suppose
the
militia
could
supply
arms
jefferson
also
wanted
to
expedite
the
raising
of
the
continental
levies
of
regulars
and
the
sending
of
these
to
greene
he
was
involved
in
several
contradictions
not
only
had
this
work
of
enlistment
been
interfered
with
by
the
embodiment
of
the
militia
he
was
also
acutely
aware
that
both
the
militia
in
the
east
and
those
now
with
greene
in
the
carolinas
had
already
served
a
longer
tour
of
duty
than
was
customary
and
must
be
shortly
relieved
thus
pushed
for
men
he
wrote
one
of
his
high
officers
the
baron
s
proposition
was
not
acceded
to
as
exposing
the
country
too
much
the
issue
was
not
merely
between
local
and
general
strategy
nor
even
between
the
military
and
civilian
points
of
view
in
this
amateurish
war
considerations
of
war
weariness
of
disaffection
and
of
local
psychology
also
entered
in
the
calls
of
the
militia
specified
no
precise
term
of
service
and
jefferson
s
attempt
hereafter
to
limit
this
to
two
months
was
not
legally
necessary
on
practical
grounds
it
probably
was
if
he
did
not
want
to
be
faced
with
wholesale
desertions
it
is
curiously
ironical
however
that
at
this
critical
time
he
ordered
an
extensive
shifting
of
the
militia
this
was
not
a
case
of
fiddling
while
rome
burned
for
the
governor
s
violin
was
quite
neglected
but
it
was
a
case
of
applying
principles
of
human
justice
in
a
period
of
grave
emergency
such
a
time
called
for
a
less
scrupulous
and
more
ruthless
man
steuben
now
more
contemptuous
than
ever
of
the
feeble
and
to
his
mind
indecisive
government
of
virginia
wanted
more
support
against
phillips
and
arnold
in
portsmouth
if
he
could
not
go
to
the
aid
of
greene
at
this
juncture
however
jefferson
was
very
unwilling
to
harass
the
militia
any
more
than
was
absolutely
necessary
accordingly
while
urging
steuben
and
others
to
explain
things
to
them
and
to
express
appreciation
of
their
long
and
arduous
services
he
called
upon
the
county
lieutenants
to
round
up
their
delinquents
the
penalty
of
six
months
service
on
these
men
he
thought
entirely
proper
burdens
must
be
equitably
distributed
between
counties
and
within
them
unquestionably
he
had
a
keener
sense
of
justice
than
of
military
efficiency
it
was
not
because
of
pressure
from
him
and
the
council
that
colonel
george
muter
the
commissioner
of
war
finally
resigned
they
had
declined
his
offer
to
submit
himself
to
a
formal
investigation
and
denied
having
had
complaints
against
him
in
place
of
this
official
jefferson
named
colonel
william
davies
a
continental
officer
whom
steuben
regarded
as
thoroughly
competent
but
davies
viewing
the
administrative
confusion
with
the
eye
of
a
professional
thought
it
now
little
short
of
irremediable
also
when
lafayette
came
back
this
friendly
officer
said
that
more
militia
seemed
to
be
going
off
than
coming
in
to
a
military
man
this
was
another
reductio
ad
absurdum
by
the
spring
of
when
the
governor
was
thirty
eight
years
old
his
official
troubles
had
become
so
great
that
even
reading
about
them
is
painful
to
these
personal
sorrow
was
now
added
on
april
he
made
another
mournful
entry
in
his
account
book
our
daughter
lucy
elizabeth
died
about
o
clock
a
m
this
day
he
wrote
the
infant
was
in
only
her
second
year
on
the
next
day
which
was
so
inclement
that
he
doubted
the
presence
of
a
quorum
at
the
council
meetings
he
begged
to
be
excused
from
attending
his
wife
was
in
a
situation
in
which
he
did
not
wish
to
leave
her
he
said
three
days
after
that
he
received
intelligence
that
the
enemy
were
in
motion
up
the
james
in
eleven
square
rigged
vessels
it
looked
as
though
the
interior
would
be
penetrated
again
but
he
was
not
caught
napping
this
time
he
did
all
he
was
supposed
to
do
did
it
promptly
and
remained
in
his
appointed
place
throughout
the
ten
day
period
that
the
immediate
danger
lasted
certain
members
of
the
council
were
out
of
town
at
the
most
perilous
time
doubtless
for
quite
sufficient
reasons
but
he
was
always
there
and
he
gave
no
sign
that
he
was
particularly
perturbed
he
did
not
think
there
was
much
in
richmond
now
that
the
enemy
could
damage
and
he
soon
learned
that
lafayette
was
coming
back
lafayette
came
in
time
to
save
the
capital
phillips
and
arnold
got
no
closer
than
manchester
across
the
james
to
the
south
and
they
caused
chief
damage
by
burning
tobacco
warehouses
there
and
at
petersburg
lafayette
advancing
by
forced
marches
reached
richmond
on
the
evening
of
sunday
april
and
very
shortly
after
his
arrival
he
and
jefferson
first
met
the
militia
joined
the
continental
regulars
of
the
marquis
and
the
cowardly
plunderers
as
jefferson
described
them
were
soon
sailing
down
the
river
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
enemy
would
soon
come
back
it
seemed
to
the
governor
that
the
new
continental
levies
within
the
state
could
be
sent
to
greene
as
they
were
raised
and
that
richmond
was
a
safe
enough
place
for
the
assembly
to
meet
at
the
scheduled
time
in
early
may
the
legislators
themselves
did
not
think
so
for
no
quorum
came
and
on
may
those
who
had
braved
the
dangers
determined
to
meet
two
weeks
later
in
charlottesville
jefferson
had
no
choice
but
to
follow
them
and
the
position
of
the
government
in
the
capital
soon
became
quite
untenable
anyway
the
tide
of
war
turned
swiftly
and
unexpectedly
phillips
and
arnold
reversed
their
course
and
came
back
up
the
river
for
a
more
important
purpose
than
a
predatory
raid
they
were
going
to
join
cornwallis
who
had
adopted
a
new
plan
his
lordship
leaving
behind
him
a
smaller
force
to
cope
with
greene
made
straight
for
petersburg
and
there
on
may
the
armies
of
the
enemy
were
linked
jefferson
had
certainly
not
anticipated
this
general
greene
though
continuing
to
serve
the
continental
cause
bravely
and
effectively
was
no
longer
virginia
s
shield
and
so
far
as
local
defense
was
concerned
the
troops
and
supplies
sent
to
him
were
wasted
the
military
hopes
of
the
commonwealth
now
centered
necessarily
in
lafayette
the
governor
was
still
going
through
the
customary
motions
but
he
had
to
admit
to
the
marquis
that
the
machinery
of
enforcement
in
the
counties
had
largely
broken
down
if
his
calls
did
not
produce
the
necessary
reinforcements
he
wrote
i
shall
candidly
acknowledge
that
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
do
anything
more
than
to
represent
to
the
general
assembly
that
unless
they
can
provide
more
effectually
for
the
execution
of
the
laws
it
will
be
vain
to
call
on
militia
after
a
last
conference
with
lafayette
and
what
proved
to
be
his
last
official
meeting
with
the
council
on
may
he
left
richmond
apparently
his
family
were
already
at
tuckahoe
he
himself
remained
in
that
familiar
seat
several
days
before
riding
homeward
this
was
not
a
precipitate
flight
but
a
dignified
if
discouraged
retirement
before
a
new
alignment
of
superior
forces
one
question
of
formalities
was
now
wholly
pointless
from
the
former
commander
at
portsmouth
he
had
received
a
letter
addressed
to
thomas
jefferson
esq
american
governor
of
virginia
and
not
to
be
outdone
he
had
addressed
his
reply
to
william
phillips
esq
commanding
the
british
forces
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
but
on
may
phillips
whom
his
recent
neighbor
described
as
the
proudest
man
of
the
proudest
nation
on
earth
lay
dead
in
petersburg
and
jefferson
retiring
to
supposed
safety
with
what
remained
of
virginia
s
officialdom
was
now
only
the
shadow
of
a
governor
in
his
native
county
he
soon
ceased
being
even
that
xxv
exit
his
excellency
retiring
before
the
enemy
under
the
inexorable
pressure
of
events
the
government
of
the
proud
commonwealth
of
virginia
not
only
lost
all
semblance
of
impressiveness
in
the
process
of
transferring
its
seat
from
richmond
to
charlottesville
it
practically
dissolved
the
constituent
parts
were
incompletely
reassembled
during
jefferson
s
few
remaining
days
as
chief
magistrate
he
had
called
the
council
to
meet
on
the
day
appointed
for
the
convening
of
the
adjourned
legislature
may
but
only
one
of
his
advisers
joined
him
by
then
another
showed
up
six
days
later
but
there
never
was
a
quorum
and
though
he
himself
was
always
on
hand
there
were
no
further
official
transactions
of
the
board
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
it
had
ceased
to
exist
in
his
last
days
as
the
head
of
a
moribund
executive
department
he
held
a
council
of
another
and
more
colorful
sort
a
delegation
of
illinois
indians
from
the
george
rogers
clark
country
in
which
he
was
so
deeply
interested
visited
him
and
thus
served
as
a
reminder
of
that
imperial
domain
he
smoked
the
pipe
of
peace
with
brother
john
baptist
de
coigne
though
otherwise
he
never
used
tobacco
also
as
the
great
father
he
addressed
the
chief
in
words
of
simple
eloquence
which
he
charged
not
only
with
sympathy
but
also
with
confidence
and
hope
to
him
in
june
as
in
july
this
was
a
struggle
against
tyranny
in
the
name
of
freedom
and
he
spoke
of
its
prospects
with
an
optimism
which
seems
absurd
in
view
of
british
successes
and
the
immediacy
of
his
own
peril
after
six
years
of
attempted
conquest
he
said
the
enemy
had
won
no
more
land
than
would
serve
for
the
burial
of
their
slain
warriors
upon
the
face
of
it
this
was
merely
an
idle
boast
designed
for
psychological
effect
the
governor
it
seems
was
whistling
loudly
to
keep
up
courage
other
words
of
his
however
show
that
his
optimism
was
not
wholly
feigned
this
was
the
same
sort
of
struggle
that
it
had
been
at
the
beginning
and
in
the
larger
view
he
saw
victory
as
inevitable
but
peace
is
not
far
off
he
said
the
english
cannot
hold
out
long
because
all
the
world
is
against
them
the
logic
seemed
unescapable
if
one
argued
deductively
after
viewing
the
international
scene
and
before
many
months
it
was
borne
out
by
events
despite
the
deep
darkness
of
the
hour
jefferson
had
retained
both
his
philosophy
and
his
faith
his
view
of
the
local
situation
was
another
matter
he
saw
clearly
and
stated
frankly
that
virginia
was
nearing
the
end
of
her
resources
and
that
he
himself
could
do
practically
nothing
more
before
he
addressed
the
indian
chief
with
such
show
of
confidence
he
appealed
as
a
last
resort
to
washington
to
come
to
the
rescue
of
a
sinking
state
his
last
letter
to
the
commander
in
chief
in
this
period
of
suspended
animation
was
not
a
pretentious
communication
nor
was
it
querulous
but
it
was
touching
and
he
himself
regarded
it
as
final
if
washington
was
not
already
aware
of
the
rapid
deterioration
of
the
military
situation
the
governor
left
him
in
no
possible
doubt
of
it
the
forces
of
cornwallis
and
arnold
united
at
petersburg
had
moved
northward
and
they
had
been
joined
by
fresh
reinforcements
brought
by
water
from
new
york
jefferson
did
not
know
that
virginia
was
to
be
freed
of
benedict
arnold
who
was
granted
leave
to
return
to
the
north
but
it
was
an
occasion
of
grave
concern
to
him
that
there
were
now
some
seven
thousand
enemy
troops
within
the
commonwealth
lafayette
not
yet
reinforced
by
wayne
from
pennsylvania
stood
between
the
british
and
fredericksburg
but
with
his
regulars
and
such
militia
as
could
be
armed
he
had
less
than
half
that
number
cornwallis
might
not
be
able
to
annihilate
the
marquis
actually
the
earl
soon
found
the
boy
dangerously
elusive
but
jefferson
foresaw
that
the
enemy
restraining
him
with
part
of
their
much
larger
force
could
use
the
rest
to
waste
an
unarmed
country
what
he
most
feared
was
the
acquiescence
of
a
weary
people
under
events
which
they
could
see
no
human
power
prepared
to
ward
off
he
issued
more
orders
to
the
militia
to
join
lafayette
but
he
had
no
assurance
that
these
would
be
heeded
what
his
exhausted
and
discouraged
country
needed
was
the
aid
and
presence
of
the
greatest
of
its
sons
washington
s
judgment
must
be
formed
on
a
view
of
the
whole
continental
scene
not
a
single
part
but
jefferson
believed
that
his
appearance
among
his
countrymen
would
restore
full
confidence
should
the
dangers
of
this
state
and
its
consequences
to
the
union
be
such
as
to
render
it
best
for
the
whole
that
you
should
repair
to
its
assistance
he
said
the
difficulty
would
be
to
keep
men
out
of
the
field
to
washington
this
painfully
consistent
unionist
turned
because
there
was
now
no
use
appealing
to
anybody
else
it
was
only
as
a
private
citizen
however
that
he
himself
could
hope
to
feel
the
comforting
effects
of
the
commander
in
chief
s
presence
he
was
speaking
his
valedictory
as
a
war
governor
a
few
days
will
bring
to
me
that
period
of
relief
which
the
constitution
has
prepared
for
those
oppressed
with
the
labours
of
my
office
he
said
and
a
long
declared
resolution
of
relinquishing
it
to
abler
hands
has
prepared
my
way
for
retirement
to
a
private
station
washington
could
not
yet
promise
to
come
to
the
rescue
of
virginia
but
he
could
say
this
give
me
leave
before
i
take
leave
of
your
excellency
in
your
public
capacity
to
express
the
obligations
i
am
under
for
the
readiness
and
zeal
with
which
you
have
always
forwarded
and
supported
every
measure
which
i
have
had
occasion
to
recommend
thro
you
and
to
assure
you
that
i
shall
esteem
myself
honored
by
a
continuance
of
your
friendship
and
correspondence
shou
d
your
country
permit
you
to
remain
in
the
private
walk
of
life
on
the
very
day
that
jefferson
wrote
washington
the
assembly
held
its
first
formal
session
in
charlottesville
the
month
of
may
had
almost
run
its
flowery
course
before
the
legislators
managed
to
organize
the
two
speakers
benjamin
harrison
of
the
house
of
delegates
and
archibald
cary
of
the
senate
with
some
other
members
were
guests
at
monticello
they
could
not
have
been
left
in
much
doubt
about
the
state
of
their
host
s
mind
but
jefferson
would
have
guarded
himself
better
against
later
controversy
if
he
had
made
to
the
assembly
at
this
time
a
formal
statement
of
his
unwillingness
to
serve
laryngeal
perhaps
he
thought
this
unnecessary
because
his
sentiments
were
well
known
perhaps
he
believed
that
anything
he
said
publicly
at
this
critical
juncture
would
be
liable
to
misinterpretation
perhaps
with
characteristic
deference
to
the
legislators
he
wanted
to
leave
the
ultimate
responsibility
with
them
unfortunately
however
they
did
not
immediately
provide
the
relief
he
undoubtedly
longed
for
and
almost
certainly
expected
they
resolved
to
ballot
for
governor
on
june
the
precise
date
on
which
his
second
term
of
one
year
ended
this
happened
to
fall
on
saturday
and
when
the
day
came
they
postponed
action
till
monday
not
anticipating
that
action
would
then
be
impossible
on
sunday
june
jefferson
stretched
legalities
sufficiently
to
write
several
official
letters
which
are
of
some
interest
in
themselves
and
of
more
in
that
they
were
his
last
he
accepted
the
proposal
of
the
president
of
pennsylvania
that
the
final
settlement
of
the
boundary
between
that
state
and
virginia
be
postponed
he
agreed
that
it
was
impracticable
to
determine
this
by
astronomical
observations
during
the
present
season
and
that
in
the
meantime
the
line
of
mason
and
dixon
should
be
extended
for
twenty
three
miles
by
surveyor
s
compass
this
was
a
good
note
for
peter
jefferson
s
son
to
end
on
but
the
fates
were
not
content
that
his
administration
should
expire
so
calmly
before
sunrise
on
monday
a
gigantic
horseman
rode
up
the
mountain
to
tell
him
the
british
dragoons
were
coming
he
and
his
guests
ate
a
normal
breakfast
traditionally
a
large
one
and
the
legislators
afterwards
gathered
momentarily
in
charlottesville
they
did
not
take
time
to
elect
a
governor
however
they
merely
adjourned
to
staunton
beyond
the
blue
ridge
after
the
house
of
delegates
had
agreed
that
forty
members
should
constitute
a
quorum
the
villain
of
the
piece
though
not
a
really
vile
one
was
lieutenant
colonel
tarleton
the
hero
was
towering
jack
jouett
the
victims
were
the
scampering
legislators
and
a
stranded
gentleman
who
presumed
himself
to
be
a
private
citizen
and
had
a
family
to
look
after
in
hanover
county
several
days
earlier
cornwallis
had
planned
to
distress
the
virginians
by
breaking
up
the
assembly
also
the
earl
had
learned
that
steuben
with
recent
levies
intended
for
general
greene
was
at
point
of
fork
on
the
upper
james
to
the
southwest
of
charlottesville
covering
continental
stores
there
detaching
tarleton
with
one
hundred
and
eighty
dragoons
and
seventy
mounted
infantry
cornwallis
sent
him
to
disrupt
the
government
he
dispatched
a
slower
moving
force
under
lieutenant
colonel
simcoe
against
point
of
fork
and
steuben
after
completing
his
mission
tarleton
was
to
join
simcoe
meanwhile
the
main
body
was
to
proceed
westward
through
goochland
county
to
unite
later
with
the
two
detachments
simcoe
put
steuben
to
flight
bringing
that
already
unpopular
officer
into
considerable
discredit
and
the
main
body
of
the
enemy
making
headquarters
shortly
at
elkhill
destroyed
much
of
jefferson
s
property
but
it
was
tarleton
who
did
most
damage
to
his
reputation
the
dragoons
and
mounted
infantry
starting
from
hanover
on
that
sunday
when
jefferson
wrote
his
last
official
letters
covered
seventy
miles
in
twenty
four
hours
riding
chiefly
in
the
night
they
counted
on
surprise
and
but
for
accident
would
have
achieved
it
at
a
tavern
bearing
the
incredible
name
of
cuckoo
some
forty
miles
from
charlottesville
captain
john
jouett
junior
known
in
local
story
as
jack
observed
them
the
son
and
namesake
of
the
keeper
of
the
swan
tavern
in
charlottesville
who
was
himself
something
of
legendary
figure
he
was
even
taller
than
jefferson
and
weighed
more
than
two
hundred
pounds
also
an
expert
horseman
he
knew
the
back
trails
and
bypaths
and
through
the
night
he
followed
them
it
is
said
that
the
scars
made
on
his
face
by
the
lashing
branches
of
the
undergrowth
remained
with
him
all
his
life
legend
also
has
it
that
when
he
arrived
at
monticello
before
sunrise
he
was
regaled
by
jefferson
with
old
madeira
he
then
rode
on
to
arouse
the
sleeping
legislators
in
charlottesville
jouett
was
well
ahead
of
tarleton
the
latter
rested
his
men
for
three
hours
during
the
night
paused
to
capture
and
burn
a
baggage
train
stopped
to
pluck
several
of
the
principal
gentlemen
of
virginia
from
their
beds
and
gathered
in
a
visiting
congressman
from
north
carolina
the
legend
is
also
that
he
partook
of
a
generous
breakfast
at
dr
thomas
walker
s
tarleton
s
delay
however
was
relatively
slight
and
should
detract
nothing
from
the
glory
of
jack
jouett
s
ride
which
as
an
isolated
feat
was
obviously
more
difficult
than
the
far
more
famous
one
of
paul
revere
it
came
toward
the
end
of
the
revolution
rather
than
at
the
beginning
and
the
ensuing
events
were
less
heroic
but
the
chief
difference
between
the
two
rides
lies
in
the
fact
that
no
poet
immortalized
jouett
in
passing
him
by
writers
have
missed
an
opportunity
for
he
might
have
been
depicted
in
scarlet
coat
with
military
plume
and
hat
and
was
in
other
respects
a
highly
dramatic
figure
he
rendered
great
service
to
thomas
jefferson
for
if
the
british
had
captured
him
they
would
probably
not
have
released
him
so
quickly
on
parole
as
they
did
the
other
patriots
they
would
hardly
have
caught
such
an
early
riser
in
bed
however
and
made
him
suffer
the
indignity
of
being
dragged
forth
in
his
nightshirt
by
the
time
tarleton
s
men
got
to
the
ford
of
the
rivanna
below
charlottesville
this
was
guarded
they
stormed
through
nevertheless
destroyed
stores
of
firelocks
and
gunpowder
and
despite
jack
jouett
captured
seven
dilatory
members
of
the
assembly
the
attempt
to
secure
mr
jefferson
was
ineffectual
reported
the
colonel
he
discovered
the
british
dragoons
from
his
house
before
they
could
approach
him
and
he
provided
for
his
personal
safety
with
a
precipitate
retreat
in
this
case
discretion
was
undoubtedly
the
better
part
of
valor
but
tarleton
did
not
have
firsthand
knowledge
of
jefferson
s
movements
he
sent
somebody
else
captain
mcleod
up
the
mountain
and
he
himself
hastened
on
toward
simcoe
though
that
officer
really
did
not
need
him
it
is
difficult
to
sift
truth
from
legend
but
the
former
governor
was
by
no
means
the
first
to
flee
and
there
was
no
sign
of
terror
in
his
almost
too
deliberate
movements
if
no
don
quixote
neither
was
he
a
falstaff
the
indisputable
facts
are
that
he
first
sent
off
his
guests
that
he
dispatched
his
family
in
a
carriage
a
couple
of
hours
later
and
that
he
himself
did
not
leave
monticello
until
practically
every
other
man
was
gone
and
the
enemy
were
actually
approaching
family
tradition
has
embroidered
the
story
it
is
said
that
his
delay
was
partly
occasioned
by
the
necessity
of
having
his
horse
shod
that
he
started
off
once
dismounted
to
look
through
a
telescope
saw
no
soldiers
and
turned
back
then
noting
that
he
had
dropped
his
small
sword
at
the
observation
point
he
returned
to
that
place
took
another
look
through
the
telescope
and
saw
redcoats
filling
the
streets
of
charlottesville
a
late
but
credible
account
is
that
he
was
warned
of
immediate
danger
by
a
young
officer
who
found
him
perfectly
tranquil
and
undisturbed
the
subsequent
emphasis
of
his
partisans
on
his
composure
seemed
necessary
to
them
because
of
the
charges
of
personal
cardiac
which
were
hurled
at
him
by
political
enemies
long
after
the
events
he
himself
termed
these
too
ridiculous
to
be
taken
seriously
as
they
we
ret
but
one
of
them
rankled
in
his
mind
thinking
it
unsafe
to
go
by
road
he
went
past
the
gap
and
through
the
woods
to
the
next
eminence
this
was
afterwards
referred
to
hilariously
as
the
affair
of
carter
s
mountain
the
impression
is
unescapable
that
he
remained
at
home
too
long
for
camphorate
not
that
he
left
precipitately
and
charges
based
on
the
circumstances
of
his
flight
would
have
been
ridiculous
when
so
many
others
were
fleeing
and
generally
more
hastily
he
sent
his
family
to
colonel
carter
s
blenheim
where
he
joined
them
for
daunt
and
somewhat
later
to
the
coles
place
enniscorthy
also
in
albemarle
by
the
middle
of
the
month
he
took
them
to
his
own
poplar
forest
in
bedford
county
the
british
came
nowhere
near
theme
but
in
this
safe
place
he
was
so
unlucky
as
to
fall
from
his
horse
said
to
have
been
caractacus
while
riding
over
his
farm
though
not
seriously
injured
he
was
largely
confined
to
the
house
for
six
weeks
or
more
thereafter
at
a
much
later
time
certain
domestic
enemies
asserted
that
his
accident
occurred
while
he
was
fleeing
in
terror
he
took
it
quite
casually
during
the
summer
that
it
happened
but
any
spiteful
commentator
might
have
pointed
to
it
as
a
symbol
of
his
precipitate
descent
into
a
state
of
helplessness
his
whole
procedure
was
as
dignified
as
that
of
any
wartime
fugitive
but
the
circumstances
did
not
lend
themselves
to
heroic
legend
tarleton
did
him
greatest
disservice
in
the
timing
of
his
raid
he
would
have
been
kinder
if
he
had
waited
until
the
assembly
had
chosen
another
governor
no
responsible
person
at
the
time
seems
to
have
questioned
jefferson
s
own
judgment
that
his
term
had
expedite
or
to
have
blamed
him
for
the
interregnum
that
followed
he
could
hardly
have
been
expected
to
follow
the
fleeing
legislators
to
staunton
without
a
formal
request
from
the
assembly
or
at
least
an
informal
one
from
the
speaker
st
that
he
continue
to
serve
in
the
unexpected
interim
lacking
that
he
saw
no
alternative
but
to
interpret
the
law
strictly
according
to
his
custom
assuming
that
his
term
had
expedite
resignation
was
technically
impossible
but
the
report
reached
richard
henry
lee
as
far
away
as
westmoreland
county
that
he
had
resigned
it
would
be
nearer
the
truth
to
say
that
the
government
abandoned
him
than
that
he
abandoned
the
government
but
there
must
have
been
some
people
then
as
there
were
more
thereafter
who
believed
that
he
had
abdicated
in
utter
impotence
during
late
may
and
early
june
consternation
had
spread
among
a
proud
people
such
terror
and
confusion
you
have
no
idea
of
wrote
miss
betsy
ambler
governor
cancel
everybody
scampering
it
was
the
daughter
of
jefferson
s
old
flame
rebecca
bailout
now
an
invalidate
and
of
jacquelin
ambler
an
honored
member
of
his
council
who
was
speaking
an
amusing
story
of
somebody
s
flight
before
the
enemy
had
been
told
but
this
is
not
more
laughable
said
betsy
than
the
accounts
we
have
of
our
illustrious
governor
who
they
say
took
neither
rest
nor
food
for
man
or
horse
till
he
reached
c
r
s
mountain
there
was
much
merriment
in
the
ambler
family
over
the
troubles
of
mr
jefferson
and
john
marshall
heard
of
this
in
later
years
they
were
having
serious
troubles
of
their
own
also
and
the
councilor
whom
betsy
referred
to
as
her
best
beloved
father
though
less
conspicuous
than
his
former
rival
was
certainly
no
more
heroic
he
was
one
of
those
who
never
did
succeed
in
getting
from
richmond
to
charlottesville
for
meetings
of
the
consulate
being
forced
to
remain
in
a
well
hidden
place
in
louisa
county
said
his
daughter
the
public
office
which
he
holds
makes
it
absolutely
necessary
for
him
to
run
no
risk
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
we
therefore
see
him
safely
lodged
in
the
old
coach
every
night
with
faithful
old
sam
as
his
guard
while
we
endeavor
to
make
ourselves
as
comfortable
as
we
can
in
the
overseer
s
tiny
dwelling
which
will
scarcely
hold
us
all
soon
after
this
ambler
tried
to
go
on
to
charlottesville
but
the
enemy
got
there
before
him
and
he
had
to
turn
back
nor
was
he
able
to
follow
the
itinerant
legislators
to
staunton
not
until
the
council
was
back
in
richmond
more
than
a
month
after
tarleton
s
radiate
did
john
marshall
s
future
father
in
law
return
to
his
official
seat
an
anecdote
survives
about
patrick
henry
speaker
benjamin
harrison
and
john
taillight
who
went
together
from
charlottesville
to
staunton
stopping
at
a
rude
hut
in
the
hills
and
introducing
themselves
as
fugitive
legislator
st
they
were
greeted
as
cowardly
knaves
by
an
old
woman
and
told
to
ride
on
explanations
were
met
with
derision
and
unbelief
until
it
was
finally
revealed
that
patrick
henry
was
among
them
then
the
old
woman
concluded
that
everything
must
be
all
right
the
story
has
been
told
as
a
tribute
to
the
orator
s
popularity
it
also
serves
as
a
reminder
that
the
tribune
of
the
people
no
less
than
the
philosopher
of
monticello
was
forced
to
take
flight
and
that
his
situation
was
by
no
means
without
embarrassment
patrick
henry
was
exceedingly
active
in
the
assembly
which
met
beyond
the
blue
ridge
in
safety
but
amid
continuing
rumors
since
only
forty
were
necessary
for
a
quorum
the
house
of
delegates
was
able
to
convene
on
june
the
appointed
day
but
they
got
along
without
a
governor
for
nearly
a
week
not
until
june
was
an
election
held
and
the
choice
then
fell
on
thomas
nelson
junior
who
besides
being
a
prominent
citizen
a
devoted
patriot
and
an
old
friend
of
his
predecessor
was
then
the
ranking
officer
of
the
militia
there
is
no
record
of
the
ballot
but
the
probability
is
that
some
votes
were
cast
for
jefferson
owing
to
the
scarcity
of
records
it
is
almost
impossible
to
determine
the
precise
circumstances
and
the
order
of
events
about
a
half
century
later
jefferson
said
that
he
approved
of
this
combination
of
the
civil
and
military
authority
in
one
person
and
that
he
himself
resigned
in
order
that
it
might
be
effected
he
was
using
his
terms
loosely
and
after
all
those
years
his
remembrance
of
his
own
state
of
mind
had
doubtless
become
hazy
some
of
his
partisans
have
asserted
that
his
name
was
not
formally
withdrawn
until
after
a
plot
to
establish
a
dictatorship
had
been
foiled
and
that
nelson
was
then
proposed
by
jefferson
s
supporters
in
the
assembly
not
long
after
this
session
he
himself
wrote
and
within
a
few
years
said
in
cold
print
that
a
move
was
made
to
set
up
a
dictator
invested
with
every
power
legislative
executive
and
judiciary
civil
and
military
of
life
and
death
over
persons
and
property
and
that
this
was
defeated
by
only
a
few
votes
since
there
is
nothing
in
the
brief
official
journal
to
indicate
the
formal
presentation
of
such
a
proposal
he
may
be
charged
with
relying
on
hearsay
evidence
and
letting
his
fear
of
despotism
run
away
with
his
imagination
on
the
other
hand
there
must
have
been
a
good
deal
of
informal
talk
at
staunton
about
a
dictatorship
and
the
two
persons
whose
names
were
reported
to
him
probably
participated
prominently
in
this
one
of
them
was
george
nicholas
a
young
man
of
considerable
military
experience
who
was
making
his
political
debut
as
a
representative
from
hanover
county
and
the
other
was
the
veteran
patrick
henry
the
man
most
talked
about
as
a
possible
dictator
however
was
not
the
latter
as
jefferson
s
partisans
claimed
but
george
washington
and
after
him
general
greene
at
this
very
time
richard
henry
lee
who
was
not
there
and
did
not
believe
that
the
assembly
could
organize
was
proposing
that
washington
go
immediately
to
virginia
that
he
be
entrusted
by
congress
with
dictatorial
powers
and
that
when
the
legislature
did
convene
it
be
strongly
urged
to
continue
these
powers
in
him
from
six
to
ten
months
to
many
people
the
situation
seemed
to
require
unprecedented
action
and
the
assembly
actually
went
a
considerable
distance
toward
military
dictatorship
by
vesting
nelson
with
powers
which
jefferson
never
had
and
would
not
have
wanted
furthermore
the
new
governor
under
the
pressure
of
circumstances
so
far
overstepped
the
bounds
in
the
next
few
months
that
another
legislature
legalized
certain
of
his
actions
after
the
event
jefferson
showed
no
bitterness
about
either
the
election
or
the
conduct
of
his
successor
and
he
was
careful
not
to
criticize
patrick
henry
in
public
but
from
this
time
on
he
was
deeply
distrustful
of
him
the
chief
reason
though
not
the
only
one
lay
in
an
action
of
the
house
of
delegates
which
he
attributed
primarily
to
the
influence
and
animus
of
that
wordy
statesmen
even
though
george
nicholas
initiated
it
after
the
election
of
nelson
as
governor
and
before
the
house
authorized
the
presentation
of
a
pair
of
pistols
and
a
sword
to
gallant
jack
jouett
the
following
resolution
was
adopted
resolved
that
at
the
next
session
of
assembly
an
inquiry
be
made
into
the
conduct
of
the
executive
of
this
state
for
the
last
twelve
months
this
event
marked
the
nadir
of
the
entire
public
career
of
thomas
jefferson
news
whether
good
or
bad
traveled
slowly
in
those
days
and
the
former
governor
disabled
at
poplar
forest
was
off
the
beaten
track
to
that
place
a
letter
was
brought
him
by
private
hands
from
his
recent
guest
and
old
friend
speaker
archibald
cary
of
the
senate
a
more
conservative
man
than
he
but
reputedly
as
firm
a
foe
of
dictatorship
cary
told
him
that
general
nelson
had
just
arrived
in
staunton
to
succeed
him
that
the
legislature
at
length
would
give
ample
powers
to
the
executive
and
that
a
bill
had
passed
the
two
houses
for
establishing
martial
law
twenty
miles
around
both
armies
he
hoped
that
jefferson
s
personal
losses
from
the
british
had
not
been
as
great
as
reported
continuing
he
said
i
must
give
you
one
more
piece
of
news
respecting
yourself
an
address
was
ready
to
be
offered
the
senate
to
you
that
is
in
commendation
of
him
what
can
you
think
stopt
it
george
nicholas
cary
s
nephew
made
a
motion
in
the
delegates
house
for
an
inquiry
in
your
conduct
a
catalogue
of
omissions
and
other
misconduct
i
have
not
seen
the
particulars
your
friends
confident
an
inquire
would
do
you
honor
second
the
motion
i
presume
you
will
be
serv
d
with
the
order
as
this
step
taken
i
persuaded
winston
not
to
make
motion
i
heard
something
of
this
kind
was
to
be
brought
on
the
carpit
and
if
i
know
you
it
will
give
you
no
pain
he
knew
jefferson
well
but
was
very
much
mistaken
about
his
attitude
few
things
that
ever
happened
to
him
as
a
public
man
gave
him
greater
pain
he
reflected
afterwards
that
only
forty
had
been
necessary
to
make
a
quorum
and
that
this
particular
house
was
not
a
genuinely
representative
body
but
there
was
more
bitterness
than
comfort
in
the
thought
not
until
late
july
did
he
do
anything
about
the
matter
though
not
riding
caractacus
by
then
he
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
be
back
at
monticello
looking
things
over
the
damages
there
were
slight
tarleton
turned
out
to
be
a
genteel
raider
he
gave
strict
orders
that
nothing
was
to
be
harmed
and
during
the
eighteen
hours
that
captain
mcleod
was
on
the
mountain
he
guarded
everything
with
sacred
care
it
is
likely
that
jefferson
got
the
actual
resolution
from
the
house
of
delegates
about
this
time
three
members
of
the
council
who
had
served
with
him
including
jacquelin
ambler
did
not
know
about
it
until
the
middle
of
the
month
and
were
then
very
much
surprised
they
naturally
assumed
that
it
implied
censure
of
them
as
well
as
the
governor
and
in
all
fairness
it
should
have
under
these
embarrassing
circumstances
they
wondered
if
they
ought
to
continue
to
attend
meetings
but
since
their
absence
would
deprive
the
council
of
a
quorum
they
decided
to
stay
it
was
after
this
that
jefferson
wrote
to
nicholas
in
pained
dignity
asking
him
to
specify
the
unfortunate
passages
in
his
conduct
which
would
be
adduced
against
him
when
the
assembly
met
george
nicholas
a
short
and
ungainly
man
of
about
twenty
seven
was
not
only
the
nephew
of
speaker
archibald
cary
he
was
the
eldest
son
of
robert
carter
nicholas
the
late
treasurer
whom
jefferson
had
known
and
honored
before
long
he
moved
from
hanover
county
to
albemarle
and
the
later
history
of
his
family
was
closely
entwined
with
that
of
the
man
whose
conduct
he
now
wanted
to
investigate
he
himself
besides
becoming
so
grotesquely
fat
that
he
was
caricatured
as
a
plum
pudding
with
legs
attained
considerable
weight
as
a
public
man
and
in
the
next
decade
after
he
had
removed
to
kentucky
he
was
aligned
with
jefferson
while
patrick
henry
was
flirting
with
the
federalists
there
were
both
personal
and
political
reasons
why
jefferson
s
resentment
against
the
mover
of
the
resolution
did
not
last
at
first
however
his
pain
was
not
greatly
alleviated
by
the
discovery
that
the
intrepid
delegate
from
hanover
was
suffering
some
embarrassment
of
his
own
replying
to
jefferson
s
letter
in
sprawling
and
rather
childish
writing
the
young
man
said
that
no
particular
instances
of
misconduct
had
been
specified
however
as
a
freeman
and
a
representative
of
freemen
he
stood
on
his
right
to
ask
the
executive
to
account
for
the
many
miscarriages
and
losses
the
state
had
suffered
so
far
as
they
were
concerned
in
them
or
might
have
prevented
them
he
was
distinctly
on
the
defensive
however
and
he
spoke
of
the
executive
in
the
plural
obviously
meaning
to
include
the
council
he
had
acted
in
no
spirit
of
personal
pique
he
said
and
was
quite
willing
to
change
any
opinion
he
might
have
formed
if
it
should
prove
groundless
since
jefferson
had
requested
it
he
mentioned
certain
things
which
seemed
to
require
explanation
these
began
with
the
lack
of
opposition
to
arnold
s
raid
and
included
alleged
failures
to
issue
timely
orders
to
the
militia
along
with
a
few
other
minor
matters
of
the
sort
there
was
no
mention
whatever
of
tarleton
s
raid
which
ought
to
have
been
fresh
in
a
legislator
s
mind
nor
was
there
reference
to
the
absence
of
the
governor
from
the
scene
of
danger
at
any
other
time
apparently
nicholas
soon
withdrew
some
of
these
specifications
and
substituted
others
the
accusations
to
which
jefferson
drew
up
detailed
answers
for
the
benefit
of
the
assembly
dealt
wholly
with
arnold
s
raid
he
afterwards
said
that
nicholas
unlike
many
other
legislators
was
not
in
richmond
in
that
troubled
time
and
did
not
realize
just
what
the
conditions
were
and
just
what
was
done
to
meet
them
at
all
events
the
accuser
appears
never
to
have
reflected
on
the
governor
s
personal
courage
nor
to
have
charged
him
with
general
incompetence
before
the
assembly
met
he
must
have
undergone
a
complete
change
of
heart
for
he
then
presented
no
charges
of
any
sort
the
accused
said
nothing
in
public
and
little
in
private
during
the
interval
but
what
he
did
say
showed
that
he
was
deeply
wounded
early
in
august
he
received
through
lafayette
a
belated
letter
from
the
president
of
congress
asking
him
to
go
abroad
as
a
peace
commissioner
he
may
have
overstated
his
disappointment
that
he
was
unable
to
accept
the
post
he
wrote
lafayette
that
he
was
losing
the
only
opportunity
he
ever
had
and
perhaps
ever
would
have
to
combine
public
service
with
private
gratification
but
he
must
remain
in
virginia
until
the
legislature
met
his
immediate
task
was
to
show
that
public
poverty
and
private
disobedience
not
the
misconduct
of
public
officials
had
produced
misfortunes
and
he
hoped
to
find
in
private
life
a
happiness
which
was
as
impossible
to
the
minister
of
a
commonwealth
as
to
any
slave
the
marquis
was
more
optimistic
he
correctly
predicted
to
the
french
minister
that
jefferson
would
accept
a
foreign
appointment
some
day
also
while
recognizing
that
the
machinery
of
virginia
government
was
too
rusty
for
any
governor
to
make
it
function
effectively
he
made
another
wise
forecast
to
washington
he
said
time
will
prove
that
jefferson
has
been
too
severely
charged
the
argument
about
re
entering
public
life
went
on
intermittently
between
jefferson
and
his
friends
for
many
months
edmund
randolph
pressed
him
about
the
appointment
as
peace
commissioner
he
still
found
this
attractive
but
he
had
taken
final
leave
of
everything
of
the
sort
he
said
i
have
retired
to
my
farm
my
family
and
books
from
which
i
think
nothing
will
evermore
separate
me
a
desire
to
leave
public
office
with
a
reputation
not
more
blotted
than
it
deserves
will
oblige
me
to
emerge
at
the
next
session
of
our
assembly
and
perhaps
to
aspirate
of
a
seat
in
it
but
as
i
go
with
but
a
single
object
i
shall
withdraw
when
that
shall
be
accomplished
these
words
distressed
randolph
if
you
can
justify
this
resolution
to
yourself
i
am
confident
that
you
cannot
to
the
world
he
said
george
mason
entirely
oblivious
of
the
scheduled
investigation
noted
only
the
report
that
jefferson
was
going
back
into
legislative
harness
and
hastened
to
discuss
with
him
things
which
must
be
done
and
which
he
alone
could
do
he
was
not
present
when
the
assembly
met
in
the
autumn
the
albemarle
delegation
was
then
complete
and
not
until
late
in
november
was
there
a
vacancy
which
permitted
his
election
the
house
of
delegates
paid
no
attention
to
the
resolution
for
an
inquiry
until
about
that
time
which
was
after
the
surrender
of
cornwallis
at
yorktown
and
the
freeing
of
virginia
from
the
dread
invaders
jefferson
congratulated
washington
on
the
return
to
his
native
state
which
he
himself
had
urged
so
plaintively
and
upon
the
glorious
victory
which
resulted
from
the
co
operation
with
french
naval
power
that
he
had
long
anticipated
these
events
did
not
occur
soon
enough
to
save
his
administration
from
disaster
but
they
created
a
state
of
mind
which
made
an
investigation
of
it
seem
superfluous
the
house
of
delegates
had
to
go
through
the
forms
on
november
they
named
a
committee
to
receive
and
state
charges
against
the
former
executive
this
consisted
of
john
banister
john
tyler
turner
southall
haynes
morgan
and
george
nicholas
the
original
mover
whose
fire
had
quite
subsided
the
news
was
transmitted
to
jefferson
by
his
friend
john
harvie
who
gave
this
encouraging
report
from
richmond
i
have
the
satisfaction
to
find
that
in
the
opinions
of
all
men
i
have
converse
with
that
the
administration
before
the
last
is
now
viewed
as
having
been
honorable
to
the
chief
magistrate
and
preservative
of
the
rights
of
the
people
and
the
constitution
of
the
land
in
short
i
think
sir
in
no
period
of
your
life
has
your
character
shone
with
a
superior
lustre
to
what
it
will
do
on
your
appearance
in
the
assembly
to
which
place
may
your
own
inclination
and
the
voice
of
the
people
speedily
send
you
the
gubernatorial
career
of
his
successor
had
not
been
marked
by
an
equally
scrupulous
legality
but
the
crisis
now
being
over
there
was
no
more
need
to
cavil
at
the
conduct
of
that
gallant
patriot
and
soldier
than
there
was
at
jefferson
s
thomas
nelson
who
had
wasted
his
health
and
spent
his
fortune
in
the
sacred
cause
found
it
necessary
to
retire
and
benjamin
harrison
succeeded
him
the
committee
of
investigation
had
not
yet
reported
and
jefferson
had
not
made
his
appearance
but
on
the
day
that
harrison
was
chosen
he
was
unwittingly
elected
a
delegate
to
congress
he
was
on
the
floor
of
the
house
of
delegates
on
december
and
within
the
next
two
days
he
voluntarily
read
aloud
the
charges
he
had
got
from
nicholas
during
the
previous
summer
and
his
answers
to
them
that
young
man
absented
himself
on
this
occasion
and
nobody
else
had
presented
any
charges
on
december
john
banister
reported
for
the
committee
that
no
information
had
been
offered
on
the
subject
matter
of
the
inquiry
and
that
in
their
opinion
it
had
been
ordered
in
the
first
place
because
of
groundless
rumors
accordingly
they
moved
a
resolution
which
was
unanimously
adopted
this
was
a
complete
vindication
but
it
contained
an
extended
reference
to
popular
rumors
which
the
senate
preferred
to
leave
out
along
with
a
few
minor
bits
the
house
agreed
and
the
senate
in
turn
voted
unanimously
as
amended
the
resolution
reads
as
follows
resolved
that
the
sincere
thanks
of
the
general
assembly
be
given
to
our
former
governor
thomas
jefferson
esq
for
his
impartial
upright
and
attentive
administration
whilst
in
office
the
assembly
wish
in
the
strongest
manner
to
declare
the
high
opinion
which
they
entertain
of
mr
jefferson
s
ability
rectitude
and
integrity
as
chief
magistrate
of
this
commonwealth
and
mean
by
thus
publicly
avowing
their
opinion
to
obviate
and
remove
all
unmerited
censure
this
was
not
so
profuse
an
apology
as
the
original
resolution
of
the
house
of
delegates
and
it
did
not
so
definitely
stamp
the
censure
of
the
former
governor
as
undeserved
but
it
reduced
to
a
minimum
the
references
to
rumors
and
hostile
criticism
if
the
legislators
hoped
to
banish
these
to
oblivion
as
presumably
they
did
they
were
unsuccessful
they
could
not
control
the
partisan
tongues
and
pens
of
the
future
but
they
did
attain
their
immediate
purpose
at
that
place
and
time
they
gave
jefferson
sufficient
vindication
the
discredit
which
he
suffered
among
his
own
countrymen
as
the
result
of
his
governorship
has
often
been
exaggerated
by
later
writers
his
prestige
was
certainly
not
injured
to
such
a
degree
that
he
was
denied
early
opportunity
to
perform
important
public
service
on
the
very
day
that
he
was
formally
exonerated
he
declined
the
appointment
as
delegate
to
congress
and
from
that
time
forward
it
was
office
that
was
seeking
him
not
he
who
was
seeking
office
he
was
persistently
reproached
by
his
friends
for
his
successive
refusals
and
forced
to
do
a
great
deal
of
explaining
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
he
had
lost
to
any
considerable
degree
the
good
will
and
the
deep
respect
of
the
responsible
leaders
of
the
commonwealth
the
effects
of
his
misfortunes
on
his
popular
leadership
are
more
difficult
to
determine
it
has
often
been
said
that
after
his
term
the
government
of
the
state
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
conservatives
such
as
nelson
and
harrison
and
since
patrick
henry
and
richard
henry
lee
had
now
swung
to
the
conservative
side
that
liberalism
went
into
eclipse
after
the
fall
of
jefferson
and
presumptively
because
of
it
the
applicability
of
these
vague
though
convenient
terms
to
the
situation
is
questionable
and
if
liberalism
was
eclipsed
in
virginia
in
this
period
the
primary
cause
was
the
war
itself
the
report
of
the
revisors
had
been
shelved
in
the
first
months
of
jefferson
s
governorship
when
his
prestige
was
high
and
during
the
next
two
years
his
own
attention
was
concentrated
on
the
conduct
of
the
war
not
on
any
program
of
reform
this
is
certainly
not
to
say
that
he
forgot
the
principles
of
freedom
which
had
caused
him
to
embark
upon
the
struggle
in
the
first
place
but
so
far
as
persons
were
concerned
the
distinction
between
progressives
and
conservatives
became
blurred
in
his
mind
as
in
those
of
most
other
people
it
has
already
been
pointed
out
that
his
influence
was
not
that
of
the
head
of
a
political
faction
contemporary
comments
emphasized
his
impartiality
toward
the
end
of
his
governorship
his
intimate
friend
george
gilmer
commenting
on
the
election
of
inferior
men
as
delegates
from
albemarle
county
bemoaned
the
rise
of
party
spirit
by
which
he
meant
petty
factionalism
speaking
of
jefferson
himself
he
said
the
envious
only
hate
the
excellence
they
cannot
reach
heaven
inspire
every
one
with
that
laudable
ambition
of
serving
their
country
as
you
have
done
without
one
self
interested
motive
jefferson
s
influence
at
this
time
was
owing
primarily
to
his
example
of
patriotic
devotion
and
his
many
personal
friendships
which
continued
to
cut
across
factional
lines
previously
as
a
long
range
reformer
he
had
been
influential
for
these
reasons
and
because
of
the
intrinsic
forcefulness
of
his
ideas
such
opposition
as
those
ideas
religious
freedom
for
example
met
later
when
thrown
into
the
arena
by
james
madison
was
probably
not
a
whit
stronger
than
it
would
have
been
if
jefferson
had
never
been
governor
of
the
state
the
chief
political
significance
of
his
troubles
as
an
executive
and
the
investigation
of
his
conduct
was
not
contemporary
others
besides
madison
took
his
vindication
for
granted
once
the
danger
of
invasion
was
past
and
regarded
the
investigation
as
inconsequential
except
in
what
it
did
to
his
own
spirits
but
when
he
became
a
national
political
figure
and
aroused
opposition
on
other
grounds
in
other
places
the
old
charges
were
unearthed
wildly
exaggerated
and
used
for
partisan
purposes
from
the
political
point
of
view
they
were
far
more
important
in
than
they
were
in
and
they
were
displayed
periodically
thereafter
as
late
as
when
he
had
been
four
years
president
a
friendly
virginia
editor
said
among
the
various
charges
which
have
been
urged
against
mr
jefferson
the
most
important
are
those
which
relate
to
his
conduct
during
our
revolution
from
these
insinuations
it
has
been
inferred
that
mr
j
has
neither
the
spirit
nor
the
talents
to
conduct
the
administration
of
our
government
the
man
who
was
unable
to
discharge
the
duties
of
a
governor
of
virginia
is
declared
unfit
to
be
the
president
of
the
union
the
degree
of
jefferson
s
success
or
failure
as
governor
must
be
adjudged
from
the
facts
themselves
as
already
presented
in
these
pages
in
what
may
have
seemed
wearisome
detail
they
speak
more
convincingly
than
any
summary
any
biographer
may
make
at
the
conclusion
of
the
account
of
this
highly
controversial
period
however
it
may
be
said
without
much
doubt
that
the
most
conspicuous
failure
was
that
of
the
government
rather
than
the
governor
the
agencies
which
had
been
created
in
were
ill
suited
to
the
conduct
of
a
war
or
to
the
meeting
of
serious
crises
of
any
sort
this
was
a
major
lesson
of
the
entire
american
revolution
jefferson
s
position
on
the
important
question
of
the
organization
of
the
state
government
will
appear
hereafter
in
the
discussion
of
the
specific
proposals
he
made
during
the
next
two
years
he
undoubtedly
believed
that
the
executive
department
should
be
considerably
stronger
than
it
was
in
his
own
administration
but
he
was
notable
in
his
generation
for
his
devotion
to
the
sovereign
law
his
scruples
were
something
of
an
embarrassment
in
such
an
abnormal
period
and
his
legalistic
temper
would
have
been
a
handicap
at
any
time
if
he
had
not
coupled
with
it
a
genuinely
progressive
concept
of
the
necessary
mutability
of
man
made
instruments
though
characteristically
an
efficient
man
he
had
little
chance
here
and
possibly
little
inclination
to
be
an
effective
organizer
of
administration
and
he
was
made
for
much
higher
things
than
the
details
he
attended
to
so
faithfully
in
his
own
person
to
say
that
he
was
a
misfit
as
an
executive
would
be
to
say
too
much
but
there
were
other
tasks
which
he
liked
to
do
and
did
a
great
deal
better
for
a
variety
of
reasons
he
was
not
the
most
effective
of
the
war
governors
but
of
all
the
war
governors
he
was
incomparably
the
greatest
mind
and
the
greatest
man
starting
again
xxvi
a
philosopher
surveys
his
country
jefferson
s
unequaled
knowledge
of
his
native
region
was
no
accident
it
was
due
to
the
incessant
curiosity
and
the
habits
of
methodical
study
and
observation
which
he
combined
with
his
ardent
patriotism
being
the
sort
of
man
he
was
he
might
have
been
expected
to
learn
more
about
his
state
than
anybody
else
there
was
much
that
was
fortuitous
however
in
the
circumstances
that
occasioned
him
to
make
his
accumulated
information
widely
available
to
others
because
of
the
inquiries
of
a
frenchman
he
cast
this
in
systematic
form
and
added
to
it
and
he
afterwards
made
it
into
a
book
never
again
did
this
incidental
author
publish
anything
which
can
be
properly
termed
a
book
long
before
he
died
his
notes
on
the
state
of
virginia
commonly
referred
to
as
notes
on
virginia
became
famous
partly
because
he
wrote
them
no
doubt
but
also
because
the
work
was
distinctive
in
itself
it
did
not
appear
in
print
until
after
he
went
to
france
and
entered
upon
another
phase
of
his
career
by
that
time
he
had
supplemented
his
materials
in
order
to
combat
more
effectively
the
erroneous
opinions
of
french
naturalists
about
america
particularly
their
theories
about
the
degeneracy
of
animal
life
in
the
new
world
our
concern
here
is
not
with
the
whole
of
the
long
history
of
a
noted
book
and
least
of
all
with
the
parts
of
it
which
were
chiefly
designed
to
correct
european
scientific
ideas
our
interest
is
in
the
main
circumstances
of
its
preparation
and
what
is
more
important
the
major
ideas
about
the
commonwealth
and
the
republic
which
were
in
jefferson
s
mind
toward
the
close
of
the
revolution
he
did
more
than
describe
his
country
he
revealed
his
own
thought
he
began
to
assemble
the
notes
some
months
before
he
ceased
being
governor
he
was
still
exulting
over
the
departure
of
general
leslie
and
did
not
yet
know
that
benedict
arnold
was
coming
when
he
said
that
the
secretary
of
the
french
legation
had
unknowingly
done
him
a
good
turn
by
causing
him
to
become
much
better
acquainted
with
virginia
the
marquis
de
barbe
marbois
generally
referred
to
by
his
american
contemporaries
as
marbois
was
seeking
information
about
the
various
states
of
the
american
union
for
the
benefit
of
his
own
government
and
had
drawn
up
a
set
of
queries
these
got
into
the
hands
of
james
monroe
s
wise
uncle
joseph
jones
then
in
congress
and
he
turned
them
over
to
the
person
in
the
state
who
could
best
reply
to
them
and
who
also
happened
to
be
governor
at
the
first
chance
late
in
jefferson
occupied
himself
busily
with
the
questions
but
he
was
in
richmond
and
needed
his
materials
at
monticello
he
had
long
been
making
memoranda
about
virginia
on
loose
sheets
of
paper
which
he
had
bundled
together
without
bothering
to
put
them
in
order
but
he
was
not
able
to
get
at
these
for
some
time
when
marbois
wrote
him
direct
and
he
replied
in
march
the
british
had
again
deprived
him
of
most
of
his
leisure
but
he
hoped
to
have
more
before
long
this
was
another
way
of
saying
that
he
expected
to
retire
at
the
end
of
his
second
year
as
governor
he
got
even
greater
leisure
than
he
anticipated
besides
ceasing
to
be
governor
in
june
he
was
confined
to
the
house
after
his
fall
from
his
horse
he
must
have
taken
with
him
to
poplar
forest
his
old
memoranda
and
all
that
he
had
afterwards
been
able
to
collect
and
have
brought
all
these
papers
back
to
monticello
in
the
late
summer
he
did
the
actual
writing
quickly
and
could
have
dispatched
his
replies
to
marbois
before
fall
however
he
hoped
to
pick
up
some
odds
and
ends
of
information
at
the
meeting
of
the
assembly
much
as
he
dreaded
that
meeting
on
other
grounds
soon
after
his
vindication
by
the
legislature
he
was
ready
to
send
his
answers
conscious
as
he
was
of
their
imperfection
but
no
safe
conveyance
being
available
he
committed
them
to
councillor
jacquelin
ambler
rebecca
burwell
s
husband
did
not
find
a
suitable
messenger
for
an
embarrassingly
long
time
but
in
late
march
or
early
april
the
manuscript
was
in
the
frenchman
s
hands
presumably
he
received
from
jefferson
a
more
elaborate
reply
to
his
queries
than
from
anybody
else
and
certainly
he
got
far
more
than
he
had
any
reason
to
expect
he
had
sent
out
what
in
modern
parlance
would
be
called
a
questionnaire
jefferson
did
not
stick
to
the
precise
order
but
the
form
of
his
response
and
of
the
resulting
book
was
largely
determined
by
the
questions
twenty
three
all
told
he
had
no
secretarial
assistance
but
he
sent
copies
to
various
people
for
comments
others
who
learned
about
the
work
wanted
to
see
copies
and
it
was
for
this
reason
that
he
finally
decided
to
print
during
the
next
two
years
he
somewhat
enlarged
and
revised
his
manuscript
and
he
thought
the
lengthy
comments
from
his
friend
charles
thomson
secretary
of
congress
so
important
that
he
added
them
as
an
appendix
in
the
first
printing
he
was
eager
to
get
corrections
and
supplementary
information
especially
in
scientific
matters
in
the
book
as
finally
published
the
longest
section
is
the
one
replying
to
the
question
about
mineral
vegetable
and
animal
productions
comprising
about
one
fourth
of
the
whole
this
is
the
natural
history
section
par
excellence
and
it
speaks
specifically
of
the
theories
of
the
french
naturalists
especially
buffon
the
strong
presumption
that
jefferson
did
most
of
his
enlarging
and
correcting
in
this
section
is
borne
out
by
the
letters
of
inquiry
he
wrote
during
the
next
two
years
and
the
answers
he
received
he
had
considerable
doubt
whether
some
of
his
political
comments
in
other
parts
of
the
work
would
be
received
charitably
by
his
countrymen
but
he
was
quite
willing
to
make
these
on
his
own
authority
in
matters
of
natural
history
on
the
other
hand
he
sought
support
from
observers
whom
he
regarded
as
better
qualified
than
himself
he
wanted
to
verify
his
descriptions
of
curiosities
and
most
of
all
to
buttress
his
contention
that
there
had
been
no
degeneracy
of
animal
life
in
america
his
objects
are
nowhere
better
expressed
than
in
a
letter
to
his
friend
and
neighbor
thomas
walker
to
whom
he
sent
in
the
fall
of
the
portion
of
his
manuscript
which
he
was
most
anxious
to
make
accurate
that
part
particularly
which
relates
to
the
position
of
monsr
de
buffon
i
would
wish
to
have
very
correct
in
matters
of
fact
he
said
calling
attention
to
the
table
of
animals
he
had
made
he
asked
this
explorer
to
send
him
the
heaviest
weights
of
american
animals
that
he
knew
from
the
mouse
to
the
mammoth
being
specially
anxious
to
set
his
mind
straight
about
the
large
beasts
he
sent
to
half
a
dozen
qualified
observers
what
amounted
to
a
questionnaire
about
the
moose
at
this
stage
the
bigger
the
animals
the
better
he
liked
them
but
he
wanted
precise
information
or
reasonable
conjectures
also
he
sought
comments
on
the
indians
and
his
method
of
procedure
is
shown
by
the
free
use
he
made
of
an
answer
to
buffon
which
archibald
cary
sent
him
in
spite
of
his
doubts
about
the
adequacy
of
his
information
he
probably
enjoyed
writing
the
natural
history
section
most
and
as
an
index
of
his
position
in
the
history
of
advancing
science
many
people
will
find
it
the
most
interesting
portion
of
his
book
but
this
was
not
a
book
as
yet
and
that
portion
was
the
slowest
in
completion
most
of
what
turned
out
to
be
his
magnum
opus
was
tossed
off
in
a
few
summer
weeks
and
based
on
materials
he
had
already
collected
and
already
understood
it
was
an
ad
hoc
work
like
practically
everything
else
he
ever
wrote
it
was
unpretentious
and
unlabored
and
at
no
time
was
he
much
concerned
about
its
literary
form
but
he
did
more
than
throw
together
an
extraordinary
mass
of
materials
descriptive
of
his
own
commonwealth
he
also
interjected
reflections
which
gave
the
work
as
a
whole
a
philosophical
tone
related
it
to
a
far
larger
region
than
virginia
and
imparted
to
it
a
quality
of
timelessness
if
not
of
immortality
if
he
was
not
thereby
revealed
as
a
man
of
genius
he
was
undoubtedly
shown
to
be
a
man
of
most
unusual
and
diverse
talent
and
of
unsullied
patriotism
despite
all
his
recent
troubles
as
a
state
official
the
former
governor
viewed
his
commonwealth
with
deep
pride
mobs
had
not
asked
him
to
begin
with
geography
but
as
the
son
of
a
map
maker
it
was
eminently
appropriate
that
he
should
the
vast
domain
which
virginia
had
long
claimed
was
shrinking
that
very
year
the
state
offered
to
the
union
the
territory
north
and
west
of
the
ohio
though
jefferson
himself
was
back
in
congress
before
the
cession
became
an
accomplished
fact
the
region
he
described
consisted
of
the
present
state
along
with
west
virginia
and
kentucky
it
was
a
roughly
triangular
area
about
one
third
larger
than
great
britain
and
ireland
as
he
estimated
somewhat
too
generously
if
not
quite
so
large
as
he
believed
it
contained
more
than
square
miles
and
was
considerably
larger
than
any
commonwealth
east
of
the
mississippi
at
the
present
time
this
was
an
empire
state
before
and
beyond
all
others
the
military
impotence
of
his
last
year
as
governor
was
now
forgotten
he
was
a
citizen
of
no
mean
country
in
population
it
stood
first
in
the
american
confederation
and
if
its
potentialities
were
not
limitless
they
were
immense
from
monticello
he
could
look
into
ten
or
a
dozen
counties
but
some
of
his
countrymen
had
seen
more
of
virginia
s
imperial
domain
than
he
had
george
rogers
clark
dr
thomas
walker
and
george
washington
for
example
the
only
mountain
barrier
that
he
had
penetrated
was
the
blue
ridge
beyond
the
shenandoah
valley
he
had
not
been
and
never
went
he
had
seen
natural
bridge
on
his
own
property
he
described
this
as
the
most
sublime
of
nature
s
works
and
before
he
put
his
notes
into
print
he
had
viewed
the
passage
of
the
potomac
through
the
blue
ridge
at
harper
s
ferry
which
he
regarded
as
a
stupendous
scene
but
he
never
blazed
trails
in
the
wilderness
as
his
father
had
he
gained
his
knowledge
of
the
outlying
region
from
maps
beginning
with
that
of
fry
and
jefferson
from
occasional
printed
accounts
and
from
talks
with
indians
and
explorers
the
great
western
country
was
a
vivid
reality
in
his
mind
nevertheless
and
when
he
started
talking
he
could
not
hold
himself
within
the
boundaries
of
virginia
he
spoke
not
merely
of
the
potomac
the
rappahannock
the
york
the
james
and
the
appomattox
but
of
the
a
the
most
beautiful
river
on
earth
the
periodically
flooded
mississippi
the
muddy
missouri
the
gentle
illinois
the
lovely
wabash
and
a
dozen
other
major
or
lesser
streams
of
the
wild
interior
in
the
light
of
his
later
deeds
as
president
chief
interest
attaches
to
what
he
said
about
future
commerce
on
the
father
of
waters
namely
that
it
would
be
of
the
first
importance
but
his
comments
on
the
potomac
and
by
comparison
the
hudson
are
worthy
of
passing
note
through
one
or
the
other
of
these
waterways
he
believed
the
interior
could
be
best
connected
with
the
atlantic
and
his
local
feeling
disposed
him
to
recognize
the
natural
advantages
of
the
former
it
was
more
direct
less
impeded
by
winter
ice
less
endangered
by
indians
he
recognized
that
there
were
real
difficulties
in
getting
from
the
headwaters
of
the
a
to
those
of
the
potomac
and
he
afterwards
discussed
with
washington
the
necessity
of
opening
the
upper
stretches
of
these
rivers
in
this
respect
history
proved
that
he
was
not
infallible
as
a
prophet
it
gave
the
verdict
to
the
hudson
gateway
and
caused
new
york
not
virginia
to
be
the
empire
state
in
their
immediate
setting
however
his
remarks
are
significant
in
revealing
his
genuine
concern
for
internal
commerce
and
also
in
showing
his
vigorous
realism
as
a
local
patriot
he
appeared
here
however
as
far
more
than
a
localist
he
started
with
virginia
but
proceeded
by
irresistible
impulse
into
the
vastness
of
the
west
he
began
by
describing
the
flora
and
fauna
of
his
commonwealth
and
drifted
into
the
broader
subject
of
the
vegetable
and
animal
life
of
the
north
american
continent
which
he
compared
with
that
of
the
old
world
if
virginia
was
his
microcosm
it
was
after
all
a
large
one
and
since
his
state
was
so
strong
relatively
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
be
envious
of
others
through
this
wide
door
he
could
survey
the
whole
american
scene
and
the
expanding
universe
of
philosophy
it
was
in
no
spirit
of
narrowness
or
uncritical
pride
that
he
described
his
country
developing
in
detail
the
broad
outline
which
marbois
had
so
conveniently
provided
he
spoke
of
its
topography
and
minerals
its
birds
and
beasts
trees
and
vegetables
its
military
force
its
aborigines
its
counties
and
towns
its
legal
and
educational
institutions
with
obiter
dicta
about
architecture
its
religion
and
manners
its
manufacturing
and
commerce
its
revenue
and
expenses
its
histories
and
state
papers
nobody
had
ever
before
given
such
a
description
of
an
american
state
in
such
a
spirit
this
work
may
be
properly
regarded
as
the
precursor
of
the
vast
library
of
state
and
federal
reports
on
natural
and
human
resources
which
has
subsequently
been
assembled
and
in
terms
of
influence
it
may
be
regarded
as
the
most
important
scientific
work
that
had
yet
been
compiled
in
america
no
wonder
that
historians
from
that
day
to
this
have
been
turning
to
this
treasure
house
of
information
and
this
source
book
of
jefferson
s
own
ideas
his
comments
on
the
political
organization
of
the
state
which
he
had
so
recently
ceased
to
govern
deserve
first
consideration
together
with
his
remarks
about
slavery
which
have
already
been
referred
to
they
constituted
in
his
opinion
the
most
controversial
part
of
the
entire
work
to
later
generations
who
are
relatively
indifferent
to
the
problems
of
a
single
commonwealth
at
the
close
of
the
american
revolution
they
will
appear
more
interesting
because
in
certain
important
respects
they
anticipated
later
attitudes
of
jefferson
himself
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
after
three
years
as
a
legislator
and
two
as
an
executive
he
was
even
more
convinced
than
he
had
been
in
that
the
constitution
of
virginia
did
not
provide
a
genuinely
representative
government
as
he
had
proposed
a
constitution
before
he
drafted
the
declaration
of
independence
he
drafted
another
within
two
years
of
the
time
that
he
answered
the
questions
of
marbois
this
draft
was
afterwards
published
with
the
notes
as
an
appendix
and
it
may
be
regarded
as
a
constituent
part
of
that
work
it
was
his
answer
to
his
own
criticisms
he
now
proposed
to
include
within
the
electorate
of
any
county
along
with
property
holders
all
free
mail
citizens
who
had
resided
there
for
a
year
or
had
been
enrolled
that
long
in
the
militia
he
wanted
the
suffrage
to
be
extended
not
restricted
and
he
strongly
urged
that
representation
be
based
on
the
number
of
qualified
electors
in
any
county
he
wanted
to
remove
the
inequities
of
the
existing
county
unit
system
which
worked
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
more
populous
districts
and
in
increasing
degree
to
that
of
the
regions
above
the
fall
line
thus
he
again
aligned
himself
with
the
upland
mountain
and
transmontane
country
which
was
under
represented
and
more
democratic
than
the
tidewater
region
in
its
spirit
if
anybody
should
be
disposed
to
identify
democracy
with
the
dominance
of
the
popularly
elected
legislature
however
jefferson
was
definitely
opposed
to
that
to
the
theoretical
objections
he
had
raised
in
he
added
observations
based
on
his
own
experience
all
the
powers
of
government
legislative
executive
and
judiciary
result
to
the
legislative
body
he
said
the
concentrating
these
in
the
same
hands
is
precisely
the
definition
of
despotic
government
it
will
be
no
alleviation
that
these
powers
will
be
exercised
by
a
plurality
of
hands
and
not
by
a
single
one
despots
will
surely
be
as
oppressive
as
one
as
little
will
it
avail
us
that
they
are
chosen
by
ourselves
an
elective
despotism
was
not
the
government
we
fought
for
but
one
which
should
not
only
be
founded
on
free
principles
but
in
which
the
powers
of
government
should
be
so
divided
and
balanced
among
several
bodies
of
magistracy
as
that
no
one
could
transcend
their
legal
limits
without
being
effectually
checked
and
restrained
by
the
others
for
protection
against
despotism
he
relied
on
the
separation
of
departments
and
on
a
system
of
checks
and
balances
ideas
like
these
dominated
the
minds
of
most
of
the
framers
of
the
federal
constitution
a
few
years
later
and
received
classic
expression
in
madison
s
contributions
to
the
federalist
papers
in
one
of
these
he
quoted
jefferson
s
very
words
the
jefferson
of
this
period
was
certainly
not
one
to
make
demagogic
appeals
to
the
ignorant
multitude
or
to
tolerate
tyranny
in
democratic
any
more
than
in
monarchical
guise
his
major
concern
was
for
freedom
as
it
always
had
been
and
he
would
not
leave
freedom
to
chance
but
would
buttress
it
by
law
it
seemed
to
him
that
under
existing
conditions
the
department
of
government
most
likely
to
be
guilty
of
encroachment
was
the
legislature
on
the
basis
of
his
own
experience
he
could
now
say
the
direction
of
the
executive
by
the
assembly
during
the
whole
time
of
their
session
is
becoming
habitual
and
familiar
this
he
attributed
neither
to
ill
intention
nor
to
corruption
nor
did
he
say
as
he
could
have
and
as
alexander
hamilton
probably
would
have
that
meddling
with
the
executive
contributed
to
administrative
ineffectiveness
and
thus
endangered
the
security
of
the
state
he
was
fuller
of
fears
about
the
future
than
of
regrets
about
the
past
but
he
was
not
specially
fearful
of
disorder
he
was
chiefly
disturbed
by
the
dangers
to
liberty
in
general
which
would
result
from
the
probable
abuse
of
this
unlimited
legislative
power
at
a
later
time
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
whole
idea
of
a
representative
republic
was
imperiled
whenever
any
part
of
the
government
assumed
authority
beyond
its
mandate
from
the
sovereign
electorate
this
was
the
main
reason
why
he
again
objected
and
far
more
strongly
than
in
to
the
framing
of
a
constitution
by
a
legislative
body
rather
than
by
a
specially
chosen
convention
in
his
opinion
a
constitution
was
superior
to
ordinary
legislation
and
provided
far
greater
safeguards
he
rang
the
changes
on
this
argument
for
years
without
persuading
his
countrymen
to
call
a
convention
and
frame
a
new
instrument
of
government
this
conception
of
a
constitution
however
was
the
one
which
came
to
prevail
in
the
united
states
in
view
of
the
painful
legal
limitations
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
as
governor
particular
interest
attaches
to
his
specific
proposals
with
respect
to
the
executive
he
did
not
give
a
precise
description
of
executive
functions
unquestionably
he
wanted
to
extend
these
but
he
was
more
anxious
to
guard
them
against
encroachment
he
would
have
left
with
the
assembly
the
election
of
the
governor
while
making
him
considerably
more
independent
of
that
body
by
giving
him
a
term
of
five
years
after
which
he
would
be
ineligible
for
re
election
he
recommended
the
continuance
of
the
council
of
state
thus
showing
that
he
was
still
opposed
to
anything
approaching
autocracy
one
proposal
of
his
would
have
obviated
the
embarrassment
he
had
suffered
at
a
time
when
the
conduct
of
the
assembly
deserved
investigation
quite
as
much
as
his
he
advocated
the
creation
of
a
standing
court
of
impeachment
in
which
all
three
departments
of
the
government
would
be
represented
and
before
which
any
member
of
any
department
might
be
brought
on
charges
of
misbehavior
it
was
a
well
reasoned
proposal
and
it
would
have
served
as
a
constant
reminder
to
the
legislators
that
a
good
rule
works
both
ways
he
devised
another
check
on
legislative
despotism
and
unwisdom
in
the
form
of
a
council
of
revision
consisting
of
the
governor
two
members
of
the
council
of
state
and
three
judges
this
body
was
to
have
the
veto
power
which
he
lacked
as
governor
though
it
could
be
overridden
by
a
two
thirds
vote
it
might
have
served
a
valuable
purpose
in
connection
with
the
form
as
well
as
the
substance
of
legislation
the
sort
of
government
he
favored
would
have
been
more
representative
better
balanced
and
more
just
than
the
one
that
existed
and
it
might
have
been
considerably
more
efficient
under
such
a
system
he
himself
would
almost
certainly
have
been
a
more
effective
governor
in
either
war
or
peace
and
it
is
a
pity
that
apathy
prevented
his
wise
recommendations
from
being
seriously
considered
he
and
madison
believed
that
the
chances
of
calling
a
constitutional
convention
and
of
gaining
desirable
results
if
one
were
called
would
have
been
greatly
enhanced
by
the
removal
of
patrick
henry
from
the
scene
jefferson
continued
to
guard
his
comments
on
the
most
popular
political
figure
in
the
state
even
when
talking
about
him
in
private
letters
to
madison
he
had
recourse
to
cipher
he
never
lost
his
admiration
for
henry
s
pre
revolutionary
services
but
he
now
regarded
him
as
an
ambitious
politician
and
he
was
probably
correct
in
believing
that
any
new
constitution
framed
for
virginia
while
the
orator
still
lived
would
be
bad
the
presumption
is
not
that
henry
would
have
tried
to
create
the
forms
of
personal
dictatorship
as
jefferson
still
feared
a
more
likely
guess
is
that
he
would
have
wanted
to
leave
power
with
the
legislature
which
he
generally
controlled
as
to
orderly
and
well
regulated
administration
if
jefferson
s
interpretation
of
the
habits
of
the
man
was
approximately
correct
henry
had
very
slight
interest
in
that
jefferson
himself
advocated
a
calculated
dispersal
of
functions
and
despite
his
wartime
experiences
he
still
favored
a
government
which
was
mild
as
well
as
reasonable
incredibly
industrious
as
he
was
in
person
he
had
not
moved
far
in
the
direction
of
an
energetic
government
such
as
was
afterwards
advocated
by
alexander
hamilton
on
the
larger
stage
he
made
no
special
provision
for
the
exigencies
of
war
or
other
dangerous
crises
and
he
was
thinking
in
long
range
terms
rather
than
in
those
of
any
temporary
emergency
he
regarded
this
sort
of
civil
organization
as
sufficient
for
a
society
already
practised
in
local
self
government
and
which
he
hoped
would
be
blessed
with
peace
he
had
been
one
of
the
instigators
of
rebellion
and
although
he
had
not
become
a
soldier
like
hamilton
and
marshall
and
monroe
he
had
gone
forth
to
war
as
truly
as
any
civilian
can
he
left
no
possible
doubt
however
that
he
wanted
his
commonwealth
and
the
confederation
to
follow
henceforth
the
paths
of
peace
insofar
as
possible
young
as
we
are
he
said
and
with
such
a
country
before
us
to
fill
with
people
and
with
happiness
we
should
point
in
that
direction
the
whole
generative
force
of
nature
wasting
none
of
it
in
efforts
of
mutual
destruction
it
should
be
our
endeavor
to
cultivate
the
peace
and
friendship
of
every
nation
even
of
that
which
has
injured
us
most
when
we
shall
have
carried
our
point
against
her
he
was
speaking
of
not
merely
virginia
but
the
whole
union
and
the
ideas
he
expressed
on
the
subjects
of
commerce
manufacturing
and
agriculture
must
be
viewed
chiefly
though
not
wholly
in
this
larger
setting
he
believed
it
was
in
the
american
interest
to
throw
open
the
doors
of
commerce
and
to
ask
european
countries
to
do
the
same
he
set
no
goal
of
national
self
sufficiency
such
as
alexander
hamilton
and
henry
clay
did
later
in
order
to
avoid
the
occasion
of
future
quarrels
with
european
countries
he
was
willing
to
abandon
the
ocean
leaving
it
to
others
to
bring
goods
in
and
carry
them
away
such
a
policy
would
make
america
independent
of
the
old
world
he
thought
and
would
have
the
result
of
turning
everybody
on
his
continent
to
the
more
salutary
occupation
of
cultivating
the
soil
nevertheless
even
before
he
became
necessarily
concerned
with
commerce
as
a
federal
official
he
was
convinced
that
the
full
abandonment
of
the
sea
was
but
the
dream
of
a
philosopher
americans
as
individuals
would
continue
to
engage
in
commerce
since
this
would
involve
them
in
some
danger
of
war
he
recognized
that
some
provision
for
naval
defense
was
necessary
his
enthusiasm
however
was
not
for
swords
or
ships
and
certainly
not
for
looms
and
spindles
workshops
of
the
domestic
type
he
liked
in
the
course
of
time
his
servants
and
employees
made
carriages
furniture
and
even
nails
at
monticello
but
he
hoped
that
shops
of
the
industrial
sort
would
remain
in
europe
the
industrial
revolution
was
dawning
in
england
but
he
did
not
care
to
live
or
labor
in
that
light
with
freedom
of
trade
which
he
hoped
for
a
country
would
be
free
to
make
the
economic
arrangements
best
suited
to
its
circumstances
the
young
american
republic
richly
endowed
with
land
should
be
mated
with
the
pure
damsel
of
agriculture
commerce
was
a
vixen
and
manufacturing
a
diseased
harlot
beside
her
as
a
realistic
farmer
who
had
observed
in
his
own
region
the
soil
exhausting
effects
of
tobacco
culture
he
looked
to
the
cultivation
of
grain
crops
for
the
diffusion
of
plenty
and
happiness
but
it
was
not
primarily
as
an
economist
nor
even
as
an
agronomist
that
he
assessed
the
merits
of
agriculture
as
a
way
of
life
it
was
as
a
political
scientist
though
he
did
not
use
the
term
and
even
more
as
a
moralist
that
he
alleged
the
husband
man
in
words
bordering
on
the
poetic
and
revealing
his
own
deep
love
for
nature
other
men
should
be
rooted
in
the
soil
as
he
was
and
thus
be
assured
of
abiding
independence
palliator
and
strength
those
who
labour
in
the
earth
are
the
chosen
people
of
god
if
ever
he
had
a
chosen
people
whose
breasts
he
has
made
his
peculiar
deposit
for
substantial
and
genuine
virtue
it
is
the
focus
in
which
he
keeps
alive
that
sacred
fire
which
otherwise
might
escape
from
the
face
of
the
earth
corruption
of
morals
in
the
mass
of
cultivators
is
a
phenomenon
of
which
no
age
nor
nation
has
furnished
an
example
it
is
the
mark
set
on
those
who
not
looking
up
to
heaven
to
their
own
soil
and
industry
as
does
the
husband
man
for
their
subsistence
depend
for
it
on
casualties
and
caprice
of
customers
dependance
begets
subservience
and
venality
suffocates
the
germ
of
virtue
and
prepares
fit
tools
for
the
designs
of
ambition
this
the
natural
progress
and
consequence
of
the
arts
has
sometimes
perhaps
been
retarded
by
accidental
circumstances
but
generally
speaking
the
proportion
which
the
aggregate
of
the
other
classes
of
citizens
bears
in
any
state
to
that
of
its
husband
men
is
the
proportion
of
its
unsound
to
its
healthy
parts
and
is
a
good
enough
barometer
whereby
to
measure
its
degree
of
corruption
while
we
have
land
to
labour
then
let
us
never
wish
to
see
our
citizens
occupied
at
a
workbench
or
twirling
a
distaff
carpenters
masons
smiths
are
wanting
in
husbandry
but
for
the
general
operations
of
manufacture
let
our
work
shops
remain
in
europe
the
loss
by
the
transportation
of
commodities
across
the
atlantic
will
be
made
up
in
happiness
and
permanence
of
government
the
mobs
of
great
cities
add
just
so
much
to
the
support
of
pure
government
as
sores
do
to
the
strength
of
the
human
body
it
is
the
manners
and
spirit
of
a
people
which
preserve
a
republic
in
vigour
a
degeneracy
in
these
is
a
canker
which
soon
eats
to
the
heart
of
its
laws
and
constitution
utopia
he
did
not
envisage
but
a
vast
arcadia
he
did
his
concern
was
less
for
crops
than
people
less
for
the
rapid
multiplication
of
numbers
than
for
the
preservation
of
distinctive
political
ideals
and
institutions
the
ruthless
exploitation
of
natural
resources
and
the
extraordinarily
rapid
settlement
which
occurred
in
the
united
states
in
the
two
generations
after
his
death
might
have
been
expected
to
displease
him
also
if
he
had
maintained
the
temper
of
his
post
revolutionary
years
he
would
have
been
fearful
of
the
tide
of
foreign
born
which
engulfed
the
land
he
always
welcomed
refugees
from
despotism
and
he
favored
the
speedy
granting
of
citizenship
to
such
foreigners
as
should
come
in
but
on
political
and
moral
grounds
he
now
thought
it
safer
to
be
patient
about
future
developments
and
to
depend
primarily
on
the
natural
increase
from
the
existing
stock
it
is
for
the
happiness
of
those
united
in
society
to
harmonize
as
much
as
possible
in
matters
which
they
must
of
necessity
transact
together
he
said
civil
government
being
the
sole
object
of
forming
societies
its
administration
must
be
conducted
by
common
consent
every
species
of
government
has
its
specific
principles
ours
perhaps
are
more
peculiar
than
those
of
any
other
in
the
universe
it
is
a
composition
of
the
freest
principles
of
the
english
constitution
with
others
derived
from
natural
right
and
natural
reason
to
these
nothing
can
be
more
opposed
than
the
maxims
of
absolute
monarchies
yet
from
such
we
are
to
expect
the
greatest
number
of
emigrants
they
will
bring
with
them
the
principles
of
the
governments
they
leave
imbibed
in
their
early
youth
or
if
able
to
throw
them
off
it
will
be
in
exchange
for
an
unbounded
licentiousness
passing
as
is
usual
from
one
extreme
to
another
in
proportion
to
their
numbers
they
will
share
with
us
the
legislation
they
will
infuse
into
it
their
spirit
warp
and
bias
its
directions
and
render
it
a
heterogeneous
incoherent
distracted
mass
is
it
not
safer
to
wait
with
patience
for
the
attainment
of
any
degree
of
population
desired
or
expected
may
not
our
government
be
more
homogeneous
more
peaceable
more
durable
he
did
not
speak
in
this
way
at
the
end
of
the
century
when
his
political
foes
were
advocating
a
policy
of
exclusion
and
such
words
as
these
were
capable
of
allowable
misconstruction
but
they
show
anew
that
he
was
more
concerned
and
more
consistent
about
ends
than
means
he
often
was
conservative
in
his
efforts
to
safeguard
the
purity
of
political
society
and
as
a
reformer
he
was
in
no
hurry
even
more
interesting
than
his
incidental
remarks
on
immigrants
or
emigrants
as
his
generation
called
them
are
those
he
made
on
the
oldest
group
of
native
americans
he
listed
tribes
of
indians
with
a
fullness
and
precision
which
were
uncommon
in
his
age
and
he
discussed
the
characteristics
of
the
savages
with
an
objectivity
which
was
rare
among
the
philosophers
and
naturalists
of
other
lands
nevertheless
sentimentalism
blurred
his
scientific
vision
to
some
degree
and
his
enthusiasm
for
indian
eloquence
caused
him
to
repeat
a
story
which
got
him
into
considerable
trouble
in
later
years
his
account
of
the
murder
of
the
family
of
a
mingo
chief
named
logan
who
had
been
conspicuously
friendly
to
the
whites
aroused
a
more
lasting
controversy
than
his
strictures
on
the
constitution
of
virginia
it
was
not
challenged
until
the
last
years
of
the
century
however
and
the
whole
matter
then
became
inextricably
involved
with
the
virulent
partisanship
of
that
time
our
main
concern
here
is
with
what
he
wrote
in
the
first
place
and
his
reasons
for
writing
it
while
lord
dunmore
was
still
governor
jefferson
recorded
in
his
ever
present
account
book
the
current
and
accepted
story
of
the
murder
of
logan
s
family
this
occurred
on
a
creek
which
emptied
into
the
ohio
near
wheeling
and
it
was
an
important
incident
in
the
outbreak
of
what
is
known
historically
as
dunmore
s
war
he
could
have
heard
the
story
in
williamsburg
and
read
it
in
the
virginia
gazette
along
with
the
speech
which
logan
made
afterwards
both
in
this
speech
and
the
accompanying
story
the
blame
for
the
woes
of
the
chief
was
laid
on
colonel
michael
cresap
a
conspicuous
leader
on
the
frontier
whose
direct
responsibility
now
seems
improbable
the
authenticity
of
logan
s
little
oration
was
not
then
questioned
and
it
may
now
be
regarded
as
firmly
established
since
jefferson
s
main
desire
was
to
perpetuate
this
he
could
not
have
avoided
the
use
of
cresap
s
name
condemnation
of
the
cruelty
of
white
men
to
indians
was
quite
in
his
character
but
to
him
cresap
was
a
symbol
rather
than
a
person
the
alleged
villain
of
the
piece
died
in
and
nobody
bothered
to
defend
him
publicly
until
it
was
possible
to
make
political
capital
by
so
doing
in
his
sympathy
for
an
unfortunate
indian
jefferson
unwittingly
took
the
risk
of
reflecting
unjustly
on
a
white
border
leader
and
without
the
strict
verification
required
by
modern
historical
scholarship
he
repeated
a
generally
believed
story
this
he
did
in
order
to
introduce
a
morsel
of
native
eloquence
which
in
his
opinion
deserved
comparison
with
any
single
passage
in
demosthenes
or
cicero
it
was
not
merely
as
a
scientist
or
historian
but
also
as
a
man
of
humane
sentiment
that
he
echoed
the
lament
of
the
once
friendly
indian
who
is
there
to
mourn
for
logan
not
one
he
had
no
thought
of
future
american
controversy
in
connection
with
logan
s
speech
except
possibly
with
those
who
condoned
cruelty
to
the
red
men
but
he
was
fully
aware
by
the
time
he
published
his
book
that
he
was
inviting
scientific
conflict
with
naturalists
across
the
sea
in
certain
passages
about
the
indians
he
was
directly
answering
buffon
and
his
exaggerated
emphasis
on
indian
eloquence
was
part
of
his
larger
effort
to
demonstrate
the
excellence
of
what
was
native
to
america
for
just
the
same
reason
he
wanted
to
prove
that
the
animals
of
the
new
world
were
big
all
of
this
harmonized
with
the
task
he
afterwards
assumed
in
france
when
besides
being
a
diplomat
he
also
served
as
a
minister
of
information
his
scientific
work
was
inseparable
from
his
local
patriotism
but
actually
it
was
less
significant
in
terms
of
european
controversy
than
in
the
light
of
american
developments
we
are
more
concerned
with
the
latter
than
the
former
at
this
point
the
spirit
of
scientific
curiosity
was
arising
in
the
united
states
and
in
connection
with
this
he
again
proved
himself
a
pioneer
about
the
time
he
wrote
his
notes
on
virginia
jefferson
s
long
association
with
the
american
philosophical
society
began
eventually
he
belonged
to
a
vast
number
of
scientific
and
agricultural
organizations
lending
the
weight
of
his
influence
and
prestige
to
them
in
all
parts
of
the
united
states
but
of
all
these
the
american
philosophical
society
was
the
most
important
and
his
relations
with
it
were
the
most
significant
it
had
been
established
in
philadelphia
then
the
chief
intellectual
center
for
the
promotion
of
useful
knowledge
the
wise
and
witty
franklin
was
still
president
when
governor
jefferson
was
elected
a
member
in
the
year
along
with
george
washington
marbois
the
reverend
james
madison
and
other
men
of
prominence
or
scientific
worth
elected
a
councillor
in
he
wondered
just
what
was
expected
of
him
and
late
in
the
year
he
asked
his
fellow
councillor
charles
thomson
if
his
replies
to
marbois
would
constitute
a
suitable
offering
to
the
society
in
his
mind
the
thought
had
dawned
that
he
had
not
merely
supplied
factual
information
about
his
state
which
would
be
useful
to
the
french
ally
but
that
perhaps
he
had
also
made
a
contribution
of
a
sort
to
natural
philosophy
the
secretary
of
congress
had
not
yet
seen
the
replies
to
the
secretary
of
the
french
legation
but
he
thought
they
would
constitute
an
acceptable
present
in
the
light
of
history
this
remark
may
be
cited
as
an
unintended
but
classic
example
of
understatement
any
society
in
any
enlightened
land
would
have
afterwards
prided
itself
inordinately
on
receiving
a
copy
of
thomas
jefferson
s
original
manuscript
of
the
notes
on
vagary
thomson
himself
who
came
to
know
the
work
better
than
almost
anybody
except
the
author
soon
began
to
wonder
if
it
should
not
be
given
a
fuller
title
during
jefferson
s
first
year
in
france
thomson
termed
it
a
most
excellent
natural
history
not
merely
of
virginia
but
of
north
america
and
possibly
equal
if
not
superior
to
that
of
any
country
yet
published
soon
after
this
the
private
printing
of
the
book
was
finished
in
paris
jefferson
did
not
forget
his
philosophical
brethren
in
philadelphia
but
they
had
to
content
themselves
with
lesser
pieces
which
he
presented
to
them
at
a
later
time
unwittingly
thomson
understated
the
case
before
he
actually
saw
jefferson
s
first
offering
to
the
shrine
of
useful
information
but
no
one
has
better
expressed
the
spirit
which
animated
them
both
as
they
surveyed
the
american
scene
in
this
country
opens
to
the
philosophic
view
an
extensive
rich
and
unexplored
field
he
said
it
abounds
in
roots
plants
trees
and
minerals
to
the
virtues
and
uses
of
which
we
are
yet
strangers
what
the
soil
is
capable
of
producing
can
only
be
guessed
at
and
known
by
experiment
agriculture
is
in
its
infancy
the
human
mind
seems
just
awakening
from
a
long
stupor
of
many
ages
to
the
discovery
of
useful
arts
and
inventions
our
governments
are
yet
unformed
and
capable
of
great
improvements
in
police
finance
and
commerce
the
history
manners
and
customs
of
the
aborigines
are
but
little
known
these
and
a
thousand
other
subjects
which
will
readily
suggest
themselves
open
an
inexhaustible
mine
to
men
of
a
contemplative
and
philosophical
trend
and
therefore
though
i
regret
your
retiring
from
the
busy
anxious
scenes
of
politics
yet
i
congratulate
posterity
on
the
advantages
they
may
derive
from
your
philosophical
researches
these
were
words
to
warm
the
heart
and
when
jefferson
read
them
he
could
congratulate
himself
on
his
strategic
situation
the
vexations
of
his
governorship
were
then
over
the
military
battle
for
political
independence
had
been
won
and
peace
was
near
in
philosophic
calm
on
his
little
mountain
he
could
survey
a
vast
unexplored
country
and
its
developing
institutions
but
he
soon
found
out
that
his
period
of
undisturbed
reflection
was
tragically
short
he
never
lost
his
observing
eye
discerning
mind
and
enthusiastic
spirit
but
circumstances
forced
him
to
remain
an
incidental
scientist
and
philosopher
xxvii
tragedy
and
a
false
start
jefferson
did
not
yet
know
all
that
the
war
had
done
to
his
personal
fortunes
for
the
time
had
not
come
to
calculate
the
full
effects
of
the
depreciation
of
the
currency
however
he
had
speedily
estimated
the
damage
which
cornwallis
had
wrought
during
the
ten
days
that
he
made
headquarters
at
elkhill
when
as
jefferson
firmly
believed
the
earl
had
acted
in
the
spirit
of
total
extermination
said
the
former
governor
he
destroyed
all
my
growing
crops
of
corn
and
tobacco
he
burned
all
my
barns
containing
the
same
articles
of
the
last
year
having
first
taken
what
he
wanted
he
used
as
was
to
be
expected
all
my
stocks
of
cattle
sheep
and
hogs
for
the
sustenance
of
his
army
and
carried
off
all
the
horses
capable
of
service
of
those
too
young
for
service
he
cut
the
throats
and
he
burned
all
the
fences
on
the
plantation
so
as
to
leave
it
an
absolute
waste
he
carried
off
also
about
slaves
had
this
been
to
give
them
freedom
he
would
have
done
right
but
it
was
to
consign
them
to
inevitable
death
from
the
small
pox
and
putrid
fever
then
raging
in
his
camp
this
i
knew
afterwards
to
have
been
the
fate
of
of
them
i
never
had
any
news
of
the
remaining
three
but
presume
they
shared
the
same
fate
some
of
his
slaves
were
still
wandering
in
the
lower
country
late
in
the
permanent
losses
in
this
category
were
chiefly
from
elkhill
and
cumberland
county
but
if
the
old
age
story
of
one
of
his
bondsmen
is
believed
the
british
carried
off
a
number
of
the
house
servants
the
governor
had
had
with
him
in
richmond
his
supply
of
slaves
was
not
seriously
depleted
for
he
still
had
more
than
two
hundred
and
his
very
special
people
such
as
the
coachmen
jupiter
and
john
king
george
and
his
wife
ursula
the
cook
sukey
and
the
superior
heming
family
of
bright
mulattoes
were
safe
at
monticello
after
the
scourge
of
invasion
was
removed
life
there
resumed
its
normal
character
and
tempo
the
earliest
important
description
of
the
mansion
and
its
master
by
a
contemporary
dates
from
the
spring
of
when
the
marquis
de
chastellux
a
member
of
the
french
academy
and
a
major
general
in
rochambeau
s
army
made
a
memorable
visit
to
the
little
mountain
innumerable
pilgrims
came
thither
in
later
years
and
many
left
record
of
their
impressions
and
at
least
one
of
the
hessian
officers
had
commented
on
the
place
already
but
chastellux
left
the
best
revolutionary
description
indeed
it
is
doubtful
if
any
foreign
visitor
ever
described
jefferson
and
his
situation
more
aptly
no
object
had
escaped
this
extraordinary
man
said
the
marquis
and
it
seemed
as
if
from
his
youth
he
had
placed
his
mind
as
he
had
done
his
house
on
an
elevated
situation
from
which
he
might
contemplate
the
universe
the
house
in
the
italian
taste
though
not
faultless
seemed
rather
elegant
even
to
a
highly
cultivated
european
essentially
it
had
assumed
the
form
which
it
retained
until
this
same
architect
and
builder
remodeled
it
more
than
ten
years
later
the
pillars
of
the
two
porticoes
had
now
been
set
internally
the
major
features
were
the
lofty
saloon
on
the
first
floor
not
yet
completely
decorated
in
the
antique
style
which
was
intended
and
the
library
of
the
same
form
above
it
the
wings
were
small
and
this
visitor
did
not
talk
about
bedrooms
his
main
interest
was
in
the
center
of
social
intercourse
downstairs
and
the
library
where
the
master
s
treasured
books
were
along
with
the
tools
he
used
so
ingeniously
chastellux
saw
the
results
rather
than
the
operations
the
lord
of
the
manor
was
fully
capable
of
turning
out
a
bookcase
and
as
an
old
servant
said
he
was
as
neat
a
hand
as
ever
you
see
to
make
keys
and
locks
and
small
chains
iron
and
brass
he
had
not
entered
upon
his
most
fruitful
period
as
a
designer
of
furniture
and
domestic
devices
but
he
was
sufficiently
active
in
the
building
of
his
house
for
chastellux
to
report
that
he
was
often
one
of
the
workmen
he
did
not
actually
lay
bricks
and
set
timbers
however
so
another
observation
was
more
significant
we
may
safely
aver
that
mr
jefferson
is
the
first
american
who
has
consulted
the
fine
arts
to
know
how
he
should
shelter
himself
from
the
weather
it
was
the
host
rather
than
the
mansion
that
chastellux
was
most
eager
to
describe
he
did
not
claim
that
jefferson
was
a
perfect
whole
like
george
washington
and
most
notable
for
the
proportions
df
his
character
personality
and
physique
but
this
he
did
say
let
me
describe
to
you
a
man
not
yet
forty
tall
and
with
a
mild
and
pleasing
countenance
but
whose
mind
and
understanding
are
ample
substitutes
for
every
exterior
grace
an
american
who
without
ever
having
quitted
his
own
country
is
at
once
a
musician
skilled
in
drawing
a
geometrician
an
astronomer
a
natural
philosopher
legislator
and
statesman
supplementary
physical
details
can
be
added
from
other
sources
the
tall
frame
of
this
inveterate
student
was
not
stooped
from
study
he
was
as
a
servant
said
a
straight
up
man
he
had
a
long
face
and
a
high
nose
he
bowed
to
everybody
he
met
he
talked
with
his
arms
folded
to
a
stranger
like
chastellux
he
seemed
serious
at
first
even
cold
but
as
soon
as
he
discovered
kindred
tastes
he
warmed
up
established
intellectual
intimacy
and
displayed
enthusiasms
which
might
have
been
regarded
as
extravagant
by
those
who
did
not
share
them
one
joint
enthusiasm
which
he
and
his
guest
discovered
over
the
punch
bowl
one
evening
when
mrs
jefferson
had
retired
and
one
which
could
have
been
easily
ridiculed
afterward
was
for
the
poems
of
assertion
which
were
not
recognized
by
them
as
a
literary
hoax
some
years
earlier
jefferson
had
described
this
rude
bard
of
the
north
as
the
greatest
poet
who
had
ever
existed
with
the
aid
of
a
book
which
was
brought
down
and
placed
near
the
punch
bowl
they
now
quoted
from
these
sublime
poems
far
into
the
night
few
of
jefferson
s
favored
companions
stimulated
him
as
much
in
the
realm
of
verse
as
this
member
of
the
french
academy
it
was
to
chastellux
several
years
later
that
he
addressed
his
thoughts
on
english
prosody
his
own
imaginations
however
was
not
of
the
poetic
sort
he
was
more
interested
in
the
rules
of
accent
and
measure
than
in
mere
felicity
of
phrase
just
as
he
was
more
disposed
to
date
the
blooming
of
the
narcissus
the
feathered
hyacinth
and
the
hollyhocks
in
his
garden
than
to
comment
on
the
beauty
of
his
hillside
scene
the
observations
he
made
to
chastellux
on
climate
and
winds
and
natural
history
were
more
in
character
than
his
punch
bowl
enthusiasm
for
the
language
of
any
writer
by
this
time
jefferson
had
developed
his
deer
park
in
a
lordly
style
but
his
visitor
judged
him
to
be
no
sportsman
on
the
contrary
he
amused
himself
by
feeding
the
tamed
animals
from
his
hand
with
indian
corn
this
was
a
pleasing
picture
to
transmit
to
posterity
but
the
pity
is
that
chastellux
did
not
give
equal
space
to
mrs
jefferson
and
the
children
he
contented
himself
with
describing
her
as
mild
and
amiable
and
them
as
charming
he
reported
that
she
was
expected
every
moment
to
lie
in
and
thus
make
another
addition
to
the
human
stock
at
monticello
there
were
still
only
two
little
jeffersons
martha
or
patsy
who
was
in
her
tenth
year
and
mary
or
polly
in
her
fourth
early
in
may
after
chastellux
had
gone
off
to
natural
bridge
another
girl
arrived
she
was
given
the
same
name
lucy
elizabeth
that
had
been
borne
briefly
by
the
daughter
who
died
in
richmond
about
a
year
before
meanwhile
jefferson
had
taken
his
sister
martha
widow
of
dabney
carr
and
her
six
children
into
his
family
for
upwards
of
a
year
he
had
been
teaching
the
eldest
who
came
nearer
being
his
son
than
any
other
surviving
person
and
he
had
been
able
to
give
him
more
attention
lately
peter
carr
was
reading
virgil
and
about
to
start
french
two
other
boys
were
coming
along
and
all
of
them
were
of
very
hopeful
genius
he
said
they
must
not
be
abandoned
to
nature
also
there
were
three
girls
who
were
now
regarded
as
marriageable
and
were
approaching
an
expensive
period
he
really
had
nine
children
all
told
and
he
believed
that
he
owed
them
a
great
deal
of
time
and
attention
the
presence
of
his
sister
carr
was
doubly
welcome
at
the
time
of
his
wife
s
accouchement
he
anticipated
this
with
grave
forebodings
and
it
would
have
been
accepted
as
a
sufficient
explanation
of
his
refusal
at
this
time
to
be
drawn
back
into
the
public
service
but
he
did
not
avail
himself
of
this
ready
excuse
partly
we
may
presume
because
of
his
extreme
reluctance
to
air
his
personal
affairs
partly
because
this
might
have
been
regarded
as
only
a
temporary
disqualification
partly
it
may
be
because
anxiety
had
already
blurred
his
judgment
therefore
while
his
adored
wife
lay
on
what
proved
to
be
her
death
bed
he
was
drawn
into
painful
correspondence
which
should
have
been
avoided
two
days
before
his
daughter
was
born
he
wrote
to
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
delegates
abruptly
declining
the
office
of
delegate
for
his
county
to
which
he
had
recently
been
elected
it
may
be
assumed
that
he
had
not
been
present
at
the
meeting
of
the
freeholders
and
that
if
they
were
aware
of
his
reluctance
to
serve
they
believed
that
his
objections
could
be
eventually
overborne
james
monroe
who
had
just
been
elected
to
the
same
body
from
another
county
was
in
richmond
anxiously
awaiting
his
arrival
and
when
he
did
not
come
monroe
as
a
friend
informed
him
of
the
state
of
opinion
at
the
capital
it
was
said
that
his
fellow
citizens
of
albemarle
had
elected
him
previously
to
gratify
him
in
order
that
he
might
attend
the
assembly
and
defend
himself
and
that
they
had
now
elected
him
to
gratify
themselves
one
good
turn
deserved
another
and
he
was
accused
of
showing
a
selfish
spirit
in
refusing
this
service
to
his
county
and
country
speaker
john
tyler
who
had
laid
jefferson
s
letter
before
the
house
also
applied
polite
pressure
reporting
that
the
members
did
not
think
the
acceptance
of
the
resignation
was
warranted
and
saying
that
he
would
be
glad
to
yield
his
own
office
to
him
since
he
could
fill
it
with
more
propriety
i
suppose
your
reasons
are
weighty
he
continued
yet
i
would
suggest
that
good
and
able
men
had
better
govern
than
be
governed
since
tis
possible
indeed
highly
probable
that
if
the
able
and
good
withdraw
themselves
from
society
the
venal
and
ignorant
will
succeed
in
times
of
peace
men
of
moderate
abilities
perhaps
might
conduct
the
affairs
of
the
state
but
at
this
time
when
the
republic
wants
to
be
organized
and
requires
but
your
influence
to
promote
this
desirable
end
i
can
not
but
think
the
house
may
insist
upon
you
to
give
attendance
without
incurring
the
censure
of
being
rigid
nothing
was
said
here
about
mrs
jefferson
s
illness
he
himself
described
it
to
monroe
as
dangerous
two
weeks
after
he
wrote
the
speaker
he
mentioned
it
towards
the
end
of
a
long
letter
almost
casually
almost
as
though
he
hated
to
admit
the
fact
but
this
extraordinary
communication
cannot
be
understood
except
on
the
background
of
extreme
anxiety
his
natural
sensitivity
had
been
abnormally
heightened
and
he
explained
with
painful
elaboration
the
reasons
why
he
was
adamant
in
his
determination
to
retire
wholly
from
public
life
then
he
drew
around
himself
a
mantle
of
impenetrable
silence
so
far
as
is
known
he
wrote
no
more
letters
for
four
months
before
i
ventured
to
declare
to
my
countrymen
my
determination
to
retire
from
public
employment
he
wrote
to
james
monroe
i
examined
well
my
heart
to
know
whether
it
were
thoroughly
cured
of
every
principle
of
political
ambition
whether
no
lurking
particle
remained
which
might
leave
me
uneasy
when
reduced
within
the
limits
of
mere
private
life
i
became
satisfied
that
every
fibre
of
that
passion
was
thoroughly
eradicated
this
is
one
of
the
few
admissions
he
ever
made
that
at
one
time
he
craved
public
honor
i
considered
he
said
that
i
had
been
thirteen
years
engaged
in
public
service
that
during
that
time
i
had
so
totally
abandoned
all
attention
to
my
private
affairs
as
to
permit
them
to
run
into
great
disorder
and
ruin
that
i
had
now
a
family
advanced
in
years
which
require
my
attention
and
instruction
that
to
these
were
added
the
hopeful
offspring
of
a
deceased
friend
dabney
carr
whose
memory
must
be
ever
dear
to
me
all
of
this
was
normal
and
human
enough
but
he
began
to
appear
morbid
when
he
referred
to
the
public
ingratitude
he
had
experienced
i
had
been
so
far
from
gaining
the
affection
of
my
countrymen
which
was
the
only
reward
i
ever
asked
or
could
have
felt
that
i
had
even
lost
the
small
estimation
i
before
possessed
he
admitted
that
the
representatives
of
the
people
afterwards
relieved
him
of
blame
but
in
the
meantime
he
had
stood
arraigned
for
treason
of
the
heart
and
not
merely
weakness
of
the
head
and
these
injuries
had
inflicted
a
wound
on
his
spirit
which
only
the
grave
could
heal
anyone
who
took
his
words
at
their
face
value
would
have
believed
him
wholly
unforgiving
on
the
other
hand
almost
any
normal
person
would
have
interpreted
the
present
attitude
of
the
legislators
their
insistence
that
he
join
them
again
as
a
sign
that
they
wanted
to
forget
all
the
criticisms
of
him
in
the
past
nor
was
there
occasion
for
him
to
go
into
legalities
as
he
proceeded
to
do
in
the
effort
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
state
might
require
public
services
of
its
citizens
through
an
indefinite
period
there
was
no
reason
for
him
to
add
as
a
bitter
afterthought
that
he
had
received
a
sufficient
indication
that
he
would
not
be
oppressed
with
perpetual
service
it
would
have
been
quite
enough
to
say
that
having
spent
the
best
part
of
his
life
in
public
pursuits
he
hoped
to
pass
the
rest
of
it
in
private
quiet
there
is
no
way
of
determining
just
how
many
of
the
leaders
of
the
state
knew
about
this
bitter
letter
madison
who
was
in
philadelphia
was
imperfectly
informed
of
jefferson
s
private
situation
but
he
learned
of
his
general
attitude
and
commented
unfavorably
on
it
great
as
my
partiality
is
to
mr
jefferson
he
said
the
mode
in
which
he
seems
determined
to
revenge
the
wrong
received
from
his
country
does
not
appear
to
me
to
be
dictated
either
by
philosophy
or
patriotism
upon
the
face
of
the
matter
the
judgment
was
undeniably
just
but
monroe
was
in
better
position
to
serve
as
an
understanding
friend
distressed
by
the
news
about
mrs
jefferson
who
had
been
very
kind
to
him
and
by
the
even
more
alarming
reports
of
her
condition
which
were
now
circulating
in
richmond
he
contented
himself
with
an
expression
of
deep
sympathy
leaving
the
question
of
his
mentor
s
retreat
from
the
public
service
to
the
arbitrament
of
time
jefferson
himself
crazed
by
anxiety
was
wholly
unresponsive
under
normal
circumstances
he
would
have
been
much
pleased
to
learn
that
monroe
had
been
elected
to
the
council
but
he
was
in
no
mood
to
give
the
advice
requested
on
every
subject
of
any
consequence
to
him
nothing
mattered
but
what
should
occur
at
home
it
was
not
until
september
that
he
recorded
the
saddest
of
all
the
items
in
his
incredible
account
book
my
dear
wife
died
this
day
at
a
m
he
did
not
gratify
the
curiosity
of
posterity
by
leaving
a
description
of
the
scene
in
the
slave
quarters
it
was
remembered
that
the
house
servants
were
allowed
to
file
in
before
the
end
and
in
the
family
they
recalled
that
mrs
eppes
was
there
along
with
mrs
carr
the
recollections
of
patsy
jefferson
from
a
time
when
she
was
ten
constitute
the
major
source
of
information
she
remembered
that
for
four
months
her
father
shared
with
his
sister
and
his
sister
in
law
the
task
of
nursing
always
remaining
within
call
that
he
was
led
from
the
room
almost
insensible
just
before
his
wife
died
and
that
this
strong
man
then
fainted
that
he
kept
his
own
room
for
three
weeks
afterwards
patsy
herself
being
continuously
by
his
side
then
he
began
to
ride
incessantly
and
by
mid
october
he
emerged
from
a
stupor
of
mind
which
had
rendered
him
as
dead
to
the
world
as
she
was
whose
loss
occasioned
it
he
found
an
epitaph
for
her
in
the
iliad
this
he
used
for
other
reasons
than
the
display
of
classical
learning
he
thereby
revealed
his
devotion
to
the
initiated
while
veiling
it
from
the
vulgar
gaze
in
the
same
spirit
of
jealous
delicacy
he
carefully
preserved
and
deeply
cherished
small
souvenirs
of
his
dead
wife
but
eventually
he
also
saw
to
it
that
none
of
their
letters
should
ever
be
open
to
prying
eyes
no
one
realized
more
than
he
that
full
details
of
public
conduct
must
be
ultimately
revealed
but
he
was
determined
that
the
sacred
intimacies
of
a
lover
and
husband
should
remain
inviolate
his
wife
did
not
belong
to
posterity
she
belonged
to
him
because
of
this
impenetrable
silence
on
his
part
probably
we
shall
never
know
much
about
martha
wayles
jefferson
and
her
life
with
him
such
contemporary
comments
by
others
as
have
survived
leave
no
doubt
that
she
was
musical
and
a
few
of
them
suggest
gaiety
of
spirit
but
the
last
ones
refer
to
her
gentleness
even
to
her
saintliness
normally
she
was
stricter
with
the
children
than
he
was
though
she
probably
grew
milder
as
she
weakened
toward
them
as
they
grew
older
he
was
rigorous
in
moral
and
intellectual
matters
but
otherwise
indulgent
and
towards
her
it
may
be
safely
assumed
that
he
was
always
gentle
he
was
strongly
possessive
nevertheless
he
had
no
advanced
ideas
about
women
and
something
more
than
jocularity
may
be
perceived
in
his
later
remark
to
his
sister
in
law
about
her
woman
s
trade
his
own
wife
engaged
in
it
far
beyond
her
strength
she
gave
him
six
children
in
ten
years
after
having
already
borne
one
to
her
first
husband
the
effort
was
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
lasting
results
for
only
two
of
them
attained
maturity
experiences
of
this
sort
were
common
enough
among
the
gentry
at
that
time
but
the
widower
could
hardly
have
avoided
the
poignant
reflection
that
he
had
asked
far
too
much
of
her
and
that
her
love
for
him
was
her
undoing
she
had
not
reached
the
age
of
thirty
four
he
himself
was
now
only
thirty
nine
but
much
as
he
craved
affection
he
never
looked
for
another
wife
even
if
he
had
not
suffered
this
irreparable
loss
jefferson
could
scarcely
have
failed
to
return
at
some
time
to
the
public
life
he
had
renounced
but
he
would
hardly
have
done
so
just
when
he
did
in
his
mind
personal
grief
quickly
swallowed
up
the
pain
he
had
suffered
at
the
hands
of
his
countrymen
and
made
that
seem
a
minor
concern
politicians
tried
to
reopen
old
warlords
at
a
much
later
time
but
he
himself
could
look
back
on
the
years
before
his
wife
s
death
through
the
haze
of
sentimental
memory
and
regard
them
as
the
most
blessed
in
his
life
thus
he
wrote
to
a
friend
of
his
youth
after
he
had
gone
to
france
my
history
would
have
been
as
happy
a
one
as
i
could
have
asked
could
the
subjects
of
my
affection
have
been
immortal
but
all
the
favors
of
fortune
have
been
embittered
by
private
losses
he
rarely
mentioned
public
misfortunes
to
anybody
during
the
rest
of
this
decade
the
public
wound
had
healed
and
he
wasted
little
time
looking
at
the
scar
madison
took
the
initiative
in
getting
the
once
embittered
governor
back
into
affairs
of
state
by
moving
in
congress
the
renewal
of
jefferson
s
appointment
as
a
member
of
the
commission
to
negotiate
peace
he
had
been
elected
to
this
position
a
year
and
a
half
before
along
with
adams
john
jay
franklin
and
henry
laurens
and
in
declining
it
he
had
expressed
deep
regret
that
he
could
not
avail
himself
of
the
opportunity
to
see
at
close
hand
the
countries
of
europe
which
he
had
hitherto
admired
from
afar
even
then
he
felt
no
such
distaste
for
service
abroad
as
he
did
for
the
public
business
of
his
commonwealth
he
had
had
much
too
large
a
dose
of
that
although
cornwallis
had
surrendered
since
that
summer
and
the
war
was
virtually
ended
peace
had
not
yet
been
declared
and
negotiations
were
still
going
on
two
months
after
his
wife
s
death
it
was
thought
in
congress
that
the
reasons
for
jefferson
s
original
appointment
still
obtained
a
prominent
consideration
in
the
minds
of
the
virginians
was
the
protection
of
southern
interests
and
they
believed
that
his
presence
was
the
more
desirable
since
laurens
would
probably
be
unable
to
participate
that
commissioner
unluckily
became
a
prisoner
of
war
and
though
he
was
eventually
released
from
the
tower
of
london
and
went
to
paris
he
actually
served
there
for
only
a
couple
of
days
other
delegates
besides
virginians
and
southerners
thought
it
desirable
to
send
fresh
advices
by
jefferson
s
hand
and
nobody
raised
any
objection
to
the
renewal
of
his
appointment
if
this
action
seemed
to
congress
eminently
fitting
it
came
to
jefferson
as
a
godsend
his
cherished
plans
to
seek
satisfaction
and
happiness
in
philosophical
activities
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
had
been
shattered
he
welcomed
for
once
the
chance
to
get
away
from
monticello
where
he
believed
he
could
never
be
so
happy
again
and
although
richmond
and
the
assembly
did
not
allure
him
the
vaunted
scene
of
europe
did
toward
the
end
of
november
therefore
he
accepted
the
appointment
he
thought
there
was
some
chance
to
reach
philadelphia
in
time
to
sail
on
the
same
boat
with
chastellux
with
whom
he
hoped
to
play
chess
and
talk
on
elevated
themes
and
he
was
sure
he
could
get
there
within
a
month
he
was
no
longer
at
monticello
but
at
colonel
archibald
cary
s
ampthill
in
chesterfield
county
having
his
children
inoculated
against
smallpox
and
serving
as
their
chief
nurse
this
was
a
sufficient
excuse
not
to
attend
the
meeting
of
the
assembly
though
his
name
was
still
on
the
roll
his
sister
in
law
may
already
have
taken
the
infant
daughter
to
near
by
eppington
and
the
widower
now
arranged
to
leave
the
baby
and
little
polly
there
he
was
determined
to
take
patsy
with
him
wherever
he
went
and
educational
arrangements
for
the
young
carrs
could
wait
he
eventually
got
madison
to
aid
him
in
these
business
matters
he
left
in
the
hands
of
francis
eppes
of
chesterfield
and
nicholas
lewis
of
albemarle
and
he
arrived
in
philadelphia
late
in
december
just
as
he
had
promised
it
was
a
year
and
a
half
before
he
left
for
france
however
and
if
he
had
not
attained
a
state
of
philosophic
calm
he
might
have
been
not
only
embarrassed
but
deeply
disappointed
the
reasons
for
delay
were
twofold
and
little
short
of
contradictory
to
begin
with
the
british
had
not
given
him
safe
conduct
across
the
sea
congress
was
reluctant
to
ask
this
for
fear
of
a
refusal
and
the
precedent
of
henry
laurens
was
not
encouraging
on
the
other
hand
advices
from
europe
already
suggested
that
his
belated
crossing
might
prove
unnecessary
the
preliminary
anglo
american
articles
had
been
signed
before
he
reached
philadelphia
and
it
looked
as
though
he
might
have
nothing
to
do
in
paris
but
join
in
the
celebration
of
peace
and
victory
congress
still
wanted
him
to
go
notwithstanding
and
he
immediately
began
to
arm
himself
for
negotiation
having
no
thought
of
being
unprepared
he
had
plenty
of
time
for
the
french
vessel
which
was
supposed
to
take
him
was
not
yet
ready
nearly
all
of
the
month
of
january
he
spent
in
philadelphia
associating
pleasantly
with
madison
and
others
who
lodged
with
mrs
house
and
her
daughter
mrs
elizabeth
trist
he
strengthened
his
ties
with
the
american
philosophical
society
by
making
a
cash
contribution
he
noted
in
his
account
book
that
dr
franklin
had
had
another
birthday
and
was
now
seventy
seven
he
bought
a
chessboard
and
chessmen
even
though
he
could
not
sail
with
chastellux
he
sent
messages
to
the
eppes
family
and
the
children
he
had
left
behind
him
he
wrote
a
little
note
of
appreciation
to
george
washington
offering
to
perform
personal
commissions
for
the
general
in
the
old
world
toward
the
end
of
the
month
he
spent
five
days
and
endured
execrable
accommodations
and
society
getting
to
baltimore
where
he
had
supposed
a
french
vessel
was
ready
to
bear
him
off
he
wasted
a
month
in
that
city
terribly
bored
as
he
always
was
in
the
absence
of
employment
and
interesting
amusement
he
had
expected
to
sail
with
the
chevalier
de
villebrun
commander
of
the
romulus
who
also
had
the
frigate
guadaloupe
with
him
but
found
that
the
bad
weather
had
forced
the
frenchman
to
fall
down
the
bay
and
had
cut
him
off
from
all
communication
about
a
week
later
jefferson
managed
to
get
through
in
a
boat
after
having
been
stuck
in
the
ice
at
the
halfway
point
but
the
result
of
his
conference
was
not
encouraging
and
he
returned
to
baltimore
the
british
having
little
else
to
do
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
had
concentrated
their
strength
against
the
little
naval
force
of
the
french
and
it
was
generally
agreed
that
this
was
no
time
to
sail
about
the
middle
of
february
jefferson
got
word
from
congress
that
he
should
not
proceed
until
he
received
further
instructions
and
he
himself
feigned
indifference
as
to
whether
he
went
or
stayed
early
in
march
he
was
back
in
philadelphia
and
there
he
spent
the
month
not
until
april
after
he
had
pressed
congress
for
a
decision
one
way
or
the
other
was
he
formally
released
from
his
appointment
he
then
wrote
john
jay
that
he
really
would
not
need
lodgings
in
paris
his
leave
taking
in
virginia
had
been
premature
but
there
was
no
reason
to
rush
back
to
monticello
so
he
proceeded
home
by
way
of
richmond
where
he
discussed
affairs
with
various
leaders
soon
the
assembly
elected
him
a
delegate
to
congress
to
begin
service
in
the
fall
the
prospect
of
a
state
constitutional
convention
then
seemed
bright
and
one
of
the
first
things
he
did
after
his
return
to
his
lonely
mountain
in
early
may
was
to
make
the
draft
embodying
his
own
ideas
to
which
we
have
referred
already
this
he
sent
to
madison
some
six
weeks
later
authorizing
him
to
use
it
as
occasion
offered
the
proposed
constitution
for
virginia
showed
that
the
mind
of
the
widower
had
fully
emerged
from
stupor
he
did
not
let
it
lie
fallow
during
this
relatively
inactive
period
in
the
year
he
drew
up
a
catalogue
of
his
library
which
afterwards
became
celebrated
ever
since
the
fire
at
shadwell
in
he
had
been
assiduously
collecting
books
and
only
during
his
governorship
was
his
pursuit
of
this
favorite
avocation
seriously
interfered
with
he
maintained
contact
with
booksellers
in
williamsburg
made
purchases
in
annapolis
and
established
important
connections
in
philadelphia
we
need
not
linger
here
to
make
a
detailed
inquiry
into
the
books
he
owned
for
they
formed
part
of
the
developing
collection
which
became
a
national
possession
a
generation
later
we
need
only
note
that
he
had
volumes
in
the
spring
of
by
his
own
count
and
that
he
had
adopted
a
scheme
of
classification
by
then
this
went
back
to
lord
bacon
and
it
was
continued
by
the
library
of
congress
for
two
generations
after
he
himself
was
dead
he
was
not
disposed
to
leave
his
books
in
disorder
or
to
arrange
them
as
most
people
then
did
primarily
by
their
size
he
preferred
an
arrangement
by
subject
matter
rather
than
one
that
was
strictly
alphabetical
for
even
he
could
forget
an
author
s
name
he
found
a
basis
for
his
system
in
lord
bacon
s
table
of
sciences
following
the
division
of
the
faculties
of
the
mind
into
memory
reason
and
imagination
he
classified
his
books
under
the
corresponding
headings
of
history
philosophy
and
the
fine
arts
he
drew
subdivisions
under
each
making
more
detailed
provisions
for
works
on
law
government
and
political
history
than
a
theologian
or
physician
would
have
done
he
wanted
a
well
rounded
collection
and
listed
not
merely
what
he
had
but
also
numerous
titles
he
intended
to
acquire
his
library
was
that
of
a
practising
statesman
but
he
would
neglect
nothing
important
in
any
field
in
later
years
one
of
the
servants
often
wondered
how
his
master
came
to
have
such
a
mighty
head
when
you
asked
the
master
about
anything
he
would
go
straight
to
a
book
and
then
tell
you
all
about
it
he
had
an
abundance
of
books
sometimes
he
would
have
twenty
of
them
on
the
floor
at
once
he
would
read
first
one
then
tother
we
may
be
sure
that
the
score
of
friendly
volumes
on
the
floor
were
carefully
put
back
in
their
appointed
places
for
jefferson
kept
the
house
of
his
mind
in
order
he
collected
books
not
merely
to
own
but
to
use
them
and
for
the
same
purpose
he
assiduously
assembled
ideas
and
information
in
his
capacious
head
he
had
a
rich
and
ordered
storehouse
to
draw
on
when
a
period
of
quiet
having
followed
one
of
sharp
tragedy
he
turned
his
attention
again
to
affairs
of
state
also
he
was
thoroughly
prepared
for
the
wise
men
of
europe
when
at
last
the
opportunity
for
learned
conversation
with
them
came
xxviii
an
end
and
a
beginning
jefferson
played
his
final
role
in
the
drama
of
the
american
revolution
as
a
member
of
the
continental
congress
and
his
six
months
service
in
that
feeble
body
ending
with
his
foreign
appointment
soon
after
he
became
forty
one
constituted
the
closing
scene
of
a
notable
legislative
career
he
afterwards
presided
over
the
senate
of
the
united
states
but
never
again
was
he
a
member
of
a
representative
assembly
or
any
other
sort
of
deliberative
body
so
far
as
lawmaking
was
concerned
this
was
the
end
at
the
last
this
experienced
performer
played
a
stellar
part
but
the
contemporary
audience
was
small
and
apathetic
the
cast
as
a
whole
was
weak
and
the
setting
was
unimpressive
in
the
extreme
during
much
of
the
time
he
operated
in
a
vacuum
for
congress
as
a
working
body
was
often
non
existent
at
the
outset
he
did
not
even
know
where
he
should
go
to
find
it
when
he
accepted
election
as
one
of
virginia
s
delegates
early
in
june
he
supposed
that
in
the
autumn
he
would
have
quarters
in
philadelphia
where
he
could
find
more
kindred
philosophical
spirits
than
on
any
other
american
spot
he
soon
learned
however
that
the
discredited
congress
of
the
confederation
had
fled
to
princeton
a
pleasant
but
physically
inadequate
village
and
not
then
an
intellectual
center
of
wide
renown
nobody
knew
where
the
legislature
would
sit
after
that
a
group
of
mutinous
soldiers
who
were
seeking
back
pay
had
precipitated
the
flight
the
authorities
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
had
not
provided
the
necessary
safeguards
and
there
were
those
who
viewed
the
departure
of
the
delegates
without
regret
a
disgruntled
officer
said
the
grand
sanhedrin
of
the
nation
with
their
solemnity
and
emptiness
have
removed
to
princeton
and
left
a
state
where
their
wisdom
has
long
been
questioned
their
virtue
suspected
and
their
dignity
a
jest
even
after
congress
had
been
three
months
gone
dr
benjamin
rush
said
that
it
was
abused
laughed
at
and
cursed
in
every
company
the
derided
body
being
determined
to
preserve
its
independence
and
a
modicum
of
dignity
would
not
accept
the
proffers
of
hospitality
which
numerous
citizens
of
philadelphia
now
held
out
on
personal
grounds
jefferson
would
have
liked
to
serve
there
he
could
have
lodged
pleasantly
with
mrs
house
and
mrs
trist
as
he
had
done
briefly
in
the
previous
winter
and
he
could
have
remained
near
patsy
whom
he
had
decided
to
leave
in
the
metropolis
in
any
case
father
and
daughter
riding
in
a
two
horse
phaeton
reached
philadelphia
toward
the
end
of
october
and
jefferson
went
on
to
princeton
congress
was
still
there
but
on
the
day
he
arrived
it
adjourned
to
meet
in
annapolis
about
three
weeks
later
so
after
taking
his
seat
he
came
straight
back
there
was
little
time
for
relaxation
at
princeton
but
he
managed
to
get
a
shave
back
in
philadelphia
after
a
meaningless
trip
he
wrote
the
governor
of
virginia
about
the
future
residence
of
this
wandering
congress
in
this
matter
he
was
admittedly
a
localist
though
no
more
so
than
everybody
else
he
wanted
the
permanent
seat
of
congress
to
be
as
near
his
own
state
as
possible
and
he
preferred
georgetown
to
annapolis
hoping
that
the
commercial
benefits
would
accrue
to
the
potomac
rather
than
chesapeake
bay
he
went
on
record
at
this
early
date
as
favoring
a
potomac
site
and
before
he
ceased
being
a
legislator
he
analyzed
sectional
opinions
estimated
distances
and
considered
the
whole
problem
with
characteristic
thoroughness
and
realism
he
was
fully
informed
on
this
subject
long
before
he
had
any
occasion
to
bargain
with
alexander
hamilton
before
leaving
philadelphia
for
annapolis
the
last
week
in
november
he
made
more
lasting
arrangements
for
his
daughter
it
was
probably
on
the
suggestion
of
warm
hearted
elizabeth
trist
who
unfortunately
was
soon
to
leave
town
herself
that
mrs
thomas
hopkinson
mother
of
francis
hopkinson
took
the
eleven
year
old
girl
into
her
home
she
was
a
widow
and
rather
too
old
for
martha
to
regard
her
as
a
mother
but
this
deeply
religious
lady
was
obviously
of
the
kindly
sort
the
circumstances
facilitated
the
friendship
of
jefferson
with
francis
hopkins
on
who
was
not
only
a
fellow
signer
of
the
declaration
but
also
a
musician
and
author
of
some
note
separated
from
her
father
patsy
danced
out
the
old
year
at
the
home
of
this
gentleman
with
the
young
hopkinsons
and
the
children
of
david
rittenhouse
whose
attainments
in
astronomy
jefferson
so
much
admired
while
her
host
played
on
the
pianoforte
this
was
a
circle
in
which
the
mathematical
and
music
loving
virginian
would
himself
have
liked
to
linger
and
he
took
comfort
in
the
thought
that
patsy
would
be
more
improved
in
it
than
she
could
have
been
at
annapolis
with
him
he
had
already
planned
a
serious
course
of
reading
for
her
not
because
of
any
advanced
ideas
about
the
education
of
girls
and
women
generally
but
because
of
his
anticipation
of
her
future
responsibilities
writing
to
marbois
who
had
kindly
undertaken
to
find
a
french
tutor
for
her
he
said
that
he
had
to
look
forward
to
the
family
she
would
have
someday
his
comments
were
not
complimentary
to
his
countrymen
the
chance
that
in
marriage
she
will
draw
a
blockhead
i
calculate
at
about
fourteen
to
one
and
of
course
that
the
education
of
her
family
will
probably
rest
on
her
own
ideas
and
education
without
assistance
with
the
best
poets
and
prose
writers
i
shall
therefore
combine
a
certain
extent
of
reading
in
the
graver
sciences
the
latter
would
have
to
wait
until
she
rejoined
him
however
and
in
the
meantime
he
hoped
that
she
would
acquire
in
philadelphia
more
taste
and
proficiency
in
the
arts
than
she
had
been
able
to
in
the
forest
of
remote
albemarle
besides
english
and
french
the
rigorous
schedule
he
worked
out
for
her
after
he
went
to
annapolis
called
for
three
hours
every
day
in
music
and
three
every
other
day
in
dancing
and
drawing
however
the
frenchman
who
had
been
engaged
to
teach
her
drawing
and
paid
a
guinea
as
a
retainer
claimed
that
she
had
no
capacity
for
the
subject
and
he
could
not
be
induced
to
continue
jefferson
insisted
that
the
unwilling
tutor
keep
the
guinea
for
his
pains
he
did
not
reproach
martha
but
he
did
continuously
exhort
her
to
strive
to
be
good
and
accomplished
he
insisted
on
her
writing
regularly
to
him
and
to
her
aunts
warning
her
about
her
spelling
despite
the
inconsistency
of
his
own
following
a
suggestion
from
mrs
trist
he
urged
her
to
be
specially
careful
of
her
personal
appearance
he
hoped
that
from
the
time
of
rising
she
would
be
so
neatly
dressed
that
no
gentleman
could
discover
a
pin
amiss
he
was
a
moralistic
parent
urging
her
to
obey
the
inner
monitor
the
conscience
god
had
implanted
in
every
breast
but
patsy
remembered
his
kindness
best
her
father
s
wanderings
were
something
of
a
trial
to
her
then
and
thereafter
but
she
was
happier
in
philadelphia
than
mrs
trist
had
expected
she
had
inherited
his
sanguine
temperament
and
she
probably
concluded
that
he
had
made
the
best
arrangements
for
her
a
homeless
widower
could
madison
who
had
now
become
jefferson
s
favorite
political
companion
journeyed
to
annapolis
with
him
but
being
no
longer
a
delegate
soon
proceeded
homeward
stopping
on
the
way
at
gunston
hall
to
find
out
how
george
mason
stood
on
various
public
questions
of
the
moment
the
latter
s
heterodoxy
from
the
madisonian
and
jeffersonian
point
of
view
which
was
strongly
unionist
lay
chiefly
in
his
being
too
little
impressed
with
either
the
necessity
or
the
proper
means
of
preserving
the
confederacy
a
good
many
others
were
now
heterodox
judging
from
the
extreme
dilatoriness
of
the
delegates
in
getting
to
annapolis
it
was
more
than
two
weeks
beyond
the
appointed
date
before
enough
of
them
were
on
hand
for
a
meeting
at
the
state
house
twenty
were
then
present
including
four
virginians
but
only
seven
commonwealths
had
two
or
more
delegates
and
thus
it
was
impossible
to
attend
to
important
matters
of
business
which
required
the
vote
of
nine
states
it
was
possible
however
to
give
an
audience
to
the
commander
in
chief
who
wanted
to
lay
down
his
sword
several
weeks
earlier
jefferson
who
was
deeply
solicitous
for
the
weary
veteran
saw
washington
for
the
first
time
in
seven
years
and
noted
with
pleasure
that
the
general
had
more
health
in
his
face
than
he
had
ever
seen
in
it
before
jefferson
was
chairman
of
the
committee
that
made
arrangements
for
the
public
audience
two
days
before
christmas
though
the
report
on
details
of
ceremony
was
largely
in
the
hand
of
elbridge
gerry
congress
gave
an
elegant
public
dinner
the
day
before
some
two
hundred
guests
were
plentifully
supplied
with
good
food
and
liquor
thirteen
toasts
were
drunk
and
thirteen
cannon
shots
were
fired
despite
the
fact
that
officially
almost
half
the
states
were
absent
jefferson
may
not
have
been
at
the
ball
that
evening
in
the
state
house
but
he
was
at
the
audience
there
next
day
with
the
other
delegates
and
numerous
spectators
it
is
said
that
all
of
the
latter
wept
when
washington
solemnly
resigned
his
commission
and
that
most
of
the
congressmen
did
jefferson
with
customary
restraint
contented
himself
with
saying
that
washington
s
address
was
worthy
of
him
and
that
it
was
an
affecting
scene
no
one
was
more
anxious
than
he
to
do
washington
honor
but
he
was
not
feeling
very
well
and
was
deeply
disturbed
by
the
state
of
public
affairs
i
have
had
very
ill
health
since
i
have
been
here
and
am
getting
rather
lower
than
otherwise
he
wrote
to
madison
on
new
year
s
day
the
health
of
the
union
was
worse
congress
was
suffering
from
anemia
at
a
time
when
there
was
at
least
one
supremely
important
thing
to
do
the
peace
treaty
had
been
signed
on
september
and
delivered
to
the
president
of
congress
seven
weeks
after
that
it
was
then
learned
that
ratifications
must
be
exchanged
within
six
months
of
the
signing
but
until
nine
states
were
represented
congress
could
not
sign
soon
after
the
first
meeting
in
annapolis
when
two
and
a
half
of
the
six
months
had
already
passed
jefferson
wrote
to
the
governor
of
virginia
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
see
no
immediate
prospect
of
making
up
nine
states
so
careless
are
either
the
states
or
their
delegates
to
their
particular
interests
as
well
as
the
general
good
which
would
require
that
they
be
all
constantly
and
fully
represented
in
congress
a
week
later
he
reported
that
the
pending
departure
of
a
member
would
leave
only
six
states
represented
there
was
still
a
chance
that
somebody
would
show
up
in
time
to
get
the
ratification
to
england
by
march
but
he
saw
another
alarming
possibility
if
it
did
not
get
there
on
time
the
british
of
whom
he
was
invariably
suspicious
might
seize
the
excuse
not
to
ratify
the
treaty
unless
the
terms
were
changed
he
bore
special
responsibilities
for
he
was
chairman
of
the
committee
on
the
treaty
some
delegates
including
jefferson
s
colleague
arthur
lee
and
two
members
of
the
committee
took
the
position
that
the
vote
of
seven
states
was
sufficient
since
the
preliminary
articles
had
been
accepted
by
nine
and
these
were
practically
the
same
as
the
final
ones
some
even
said
that
the
british
need
never
know
jefferson
did
not
believe
that
this
opinion
would
have
prevailed
but
as
chairman
thought
himself
obligated
to
take
the
lead
in
combating
it
he
maintained
that
ratification
by
nine
states
was
expressly
required
by
the
articles
of
confederation
that
the
other
contracting
party
might
reject
anything
less
than
full
legal
action
and
that
any
deception
of
the
british
could
be
properly
regarded
as
a
breach
of
faith
he
fully
recognized
the
desperateness
of
the
situation
nevertheless
and
in
the
effort
to
get
the
requisite
number
of
states
he
made
a
proposal
which
now
seems
ludicrous
it
probably
seemed
much
less
so
at
the
time
since
delegate
beresford
of
south
carolina
was
too
ill
to
come
to
annapolis
jefferson
suggested
that
congress
go
in
a
body
to
his
bedside
in
philadelphia
that
is
if
the
expected
reinforcement
of
another
state
should
come
but
this
reinforcement
did
not
come
immediately
and
all
he
could
be
sure
of
was
ratification
by
seven
states
accordingly
he
moved
that
a
resolution
approved
by
that
number
be
sent
to
the
american
commissioners
abroad
that
they
should
seek
an
extension
of
time
and
that
they
be
authorized
to
present
this
resolution
with
explanations
only
if
a
ratification
by
nine
states
had
not
arrived
by
the
latest
necessary
date
by
these
means
he
stayed
the
movement
for
reckless
action
until
january
when
the
convalescent
beresford
and
two
others
appeared
in
response
to
frantic
calls
unanimous
ratification
by
twenty
three
delegates
representing
nine
states
followed
immediately
there
were
mishaps
even
after
this
action
and
the
formal
exchange
of
ratifications
took
place
not
in
march
but
may
about
that
time
congress
received
from
franklin
the
opinion
that
no
objections
would
be
raised
by
the
british
on
the
ground
of
delay
at
the
very
end
of
his
service
therefore
jefferson
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
peace
had
really
come
there
was
an
anticlimactic
quality
in
the
final
events
and
more
immediately
it
looked
as
though
ratification
would
be
followed
by
the
peace
of
death
two
days
after
congress
acted
jefferson
outlined
to
the
governor
of
virginia
the
important
subjects
then
pending
he
doubted
if
a
decision
on
any
of
these
questions
could
be
reached
and
he
believed
that
this
puny
body
would
shortly
be
compelled
to
adjourn
the
trouble
was
that
seven
of
the
states
were
represented
by
only
two
delegates
each
and
any
one
of
these
fourteen
men
by
differing
with
the
others
could
paralyze
proceedings
at
any
time
things
turned
out
to
be
even
worse
than
he
expected
for
the
gentlemen
immediately
began
to
absent
themselves
and
not
until
six
weeks
later
on
march
were
nine
states
again
represented
meanwhile
he
was
thrown
back
into
another
legislative
vacuum
among
the
small
body
of
delegates
some
were
disposed
to
fill
this
void
with
pretentious
words
and
petty
bickering
if
jefferson
s
later
comment
on
this
congress
is
not
already
a
classic
it
richly
deserves
to
be
our
body
was
little
numerous
but
very
contentious
he
said
naming
his
colleague
john
francis
mercer
as
one
who
was
afflicted
with
the
morbid
rage
of
debate
and
heard
with
impatience
any
logic
which
was
not
his
own
mercer
who
had
had
jefferson
s
guidance
in
legal
studies
several
years
before
but
who
unlike
monroe
had
not
become
a
disciple
once
asked
him
how
he
could
remain
silent
in
the
midst
of
so
much
false
reasoning
which
a
word
would
refute
i
observed
to
him
said
jefferson
that
to
refute
indeed
was
easy
but
to
silence
impossible
that
in
measures
brought
forward
by
myself
i
took
the
laboring
oar
as
was
incumbent
on
me
but
that
in
general
i
was
willing
to
listen
emulating
the
examples
of
franklin
and
washington
he
laid
his
shoulder
to
the
main
point
avoiding
needless
and
irritating
argument
in
this
very
session
he
wrote
to
the
general
an
experience
of
near
twenty
years
has
taught
me
that
public
assemblies
where
every
one
is
free
to
act
and
speak
are
the
most
powerful
looseners
of
the
bands
of
private
friendship
the
error
of
congress
in
he
said
lay
precisely
where
it
did
a
generation
later
in
too
much
disputation
but
how
could
it
be
otherwise
he
asked
in
a
body
of
lawyers
whose
trade
it
is
to
question
everything
yield
nothing
and
talk
by
the
hour
while
congress
was
marking
time
so
vociferously
jefferson
urged
madison
now
back
in
virginia
to
buy
some
available
land
near
monticello
as
monroe
and
william
short
another
protege
of
his
were
going
to
do
with
such
a
society
he
said
i
could
once
more
venture
home
and
lay
myself
up
for
the
residue
of
life
quitting
all
its
contentions
which
grow
daily
more
and
more
insupportable
life
is
of
no
value
but
as
it
brings
us
gratifications
among
the
most
valuable
of
these
is
rational
society
he
was
not
finding
much
of
it
in
annapolis
he
cast
no
aspersions
on
the
charming
little
capital
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
severn
nor
upon
the
inhabitants
who
as
certain
northern
delegates
observed
seemed
bent
only
on
pleasure
but
he
had
long
ceased
to
be
interested
in
balls
or
horseraces
and
at
this
time
he
had
little
stomach
for
social
gaiety
of
any
sort
he
sought
a
retired
existence
and
kept
company
chiefly
with
his
young
friend
monroe
after
a
time
they
rented
a
place
and
did
joint
housekeeping
assisted
by
a
frenchman
who
must
have
been
a
factotum
since
he
was
called
partout
the
only
other
member
of
the
virginia
delegation
jefferson
cared
for
was
samuel
hardy
whose
sole
fault
in
his
eyes
was
his
excessive
good
nature
he
was
sharply
critical
of
mercer
on
other
grounds
than
verbosity
describing
him
as
vain
ambitious
and
intriguing
how
little
compatibility
of
spirit
there
was
between
the
former
governor
and
arthur
lee
is
shown
by
a
slight
but
revealing
story
he
passed
on
in
cipher
to
madison
lee
finding
no
faction
among
the
men
here
entered
into
that
among
the
women
which
rages
to
a
very
high
degree
a
ball
being
appointed
by
the
one
party
on
a
certain
night
he
undertook
to
give
one
and
fixed
it
precisely
on
the
same
night
this
of
course
has
placed
him
in
the
midst
of
the
mud
the
quality
as
well
as
the
quantity
of
this
legislative
body
was
low
said
a
foreign
visitor
that
spring
the
members
of
congress
are
no
longer
in
general
men
of
merit
or
of
distinguished
talents
for
congress
is
not
respected
as
formerly
indeed
its
influence
is
feared
besides
the
state
governments
and
the
foreign
missions
absorb
the
finest
characters
of
the
union
jefferson
s
associates
were
like
the
short
growth
pines
in
the
wasteland
outside
annapolis
while
he
was
a
primeval
longleaf
it
must
have
seemed
that
his
talents
were
wasted
in
this
vacuity
congressional
business
was
trivial
the
punch
bowls
of
annapolis
were
unalluring
and
at
first
the
returns
from
correspondence
were
disappointing
he
wrote
edmund
pendleton
soon
after
he
reached
annapolis
it
is
very
essential
to
us
to
obtain
information
of
facts
of
opinions
and
of
wishes
from
our
own
country
with
this
view
i
have
been
writing
by
every
post
to
acquaintances
in
the
general
assembly
but
never
yet
have
been
able
to
provoke
one
scrip
of
a
pen
from
any
person
of
that
honourable
body
however
edmund
randolph
the
attorney
general
promised
to
send
him
all
the
intelligence
which
the
barrenness
of
this
place
richmond
can
supply
jefferson
s
chief
informants
about
virginia
affairs
in
this
period
were
randolph
and
madison
but
eventually
he
got
letters
from
others
such
as
pendleton
and
john
tyler
and
his
attitude
of
receptivity
must
have
been
widely
known
it
was
also
becoming
a
matter
of
wide
knowledge
that
he
welcomed
interesting
information
and
inquiry
of
a
scientific
or
philosophical
sort
he
and
president
madison
of
william
and
mary
compared
notes
about
the
temperature
jean
de
crevecoeur
wrote
him
from
new
york
to
inquire
if
in
remote
virginia
or
carolina
settlements
brandy
had
actually
been
distilled
from
potatoes
a
fellow
planter
gave
him
information
about
a
white
negro
thomas
hutchins
the
geographer
discussed
with
him
the
periodical
floods
on
the
western
waters
and
such
soldiers
and
frontiersmen
as
george
rogers
clark
john
sullivan
and
william
whipple
wrote
him
about
various
matters
of
natural
history
particularly
the
dimensions
and
characteristics
of
the
moose
he
was
collecting
his
ammunition
to
fire
a
blast
at
buffon
who
had
dared
assert
that
american
animals
were
small
his
main
business
was
supposed
to
be
legislative
however
and
he
was
unceasingly
diligent
at
that
in
this
petty
congress
he
served
on
practically
every
committee
of
consequence
and
drafted
as
has
been
estimated
no
fewer
than
thirty
one
papers
by
march
he
was
at
last
able
to
do
something
that
seemed
important
in
the
middle
of
the
month
he
wrote
to
madison
i
am
considerably
mended
in
my
health
and
hope
a
favorable
change
in
the
weather
which
seems
to
be
taking
place
will
reestablish
me
the
weather
in
congress
had
also
improved
nine
states
were
represented
on
march
and
he
had
turned
immediately
to
the
pressing
problem
of
the
western
lands
on
that
date
the
delegates
from
virginia
laid
before
congress
the
deed
of
cession
of
their
territory
beyond
the
ohio
for
more
than
three
years
this
highly
important
matter
had
been
pending
the
original
cession
of
had
been
unsatisfactory
to
congress
more
than
a
year
after
that
it
was
formally
rejected
and
not
until
the
autumn
of
were
terms
specified
by
the
federal
body
and
complied
with
by
the
state
the
arrangement
was
not
wholly
satisfactory
to
virginia
for
congress
declined
to
void
certain
private
claims
and
to
guarantee
the
rest
of
the
state
s
western
lands
however
jefferson
now
thought
compliance
by
virginia
necessary
as
washington
did
and
immediately
after
the
formal
acceptance
of
this
princely
gift
by
congress
he
as
chairman
of
the
committee
to
prepare
a
plan
of
temporary
government
brought
in
a
report
this
was
recommitted
presented
by
him
again
in
a
somewhat
revised
version
and
adopted
in
late
april
after
amendment
it
is
known
to
history
as
the
ordinance
of
its
essential
features
were
incorporated
in
the
more
famous
northwest
ordinance
of
and
by
means
of
it
jefferson
again
revealed
his
towering
stature
as
a
prophet
the
ordinance
of
is
most
significant
historically
because
it
embodied
the
principle
that
new
states
should
be
formed
from
the
western
region
and
admitted
to
the
union
on
an
equal
basis
with
the
original
commonwealths
this
principle
which
underlay
the
whole
later
development
of
the
continental
united
states
was
generally
accepted
by
this
time
and
cannot
be
properly
credited
to
any
single
man
jefferson
had
presented
precisely
this
idea
to
his
own
state
before
the
declaration
of
independence
however
and
if
he
did
not
originate
it
he
was
certainly
one
of
those
who
held
it
first
it
had
been
basic
in
his
own
thinking
about
the
future
of
the
republic
throughout
the
struggle
for
independence
he
had
no
desire
to
break
from
the
british
empire
only
to
establish
an
american
in
which
the
newer
region
should
be
subsidiary
and
tributary
to
the
old
what
he
dreamed
of
was
an
expanding
union
of
self
governing
commonwealths
joined
as
a
group
of
peers
one
important
feature
of
the
plan
which
he
now
brought
forward
distinguishing
it
from
the
more
renowned
but
more
limited
ordinance
of
was
its
provision
for
governments
not
merely
in
the
territory
northwest
of
the
ohio
but
in
all
that
should
afterwards
be
ceded
by
individual
states
he
already
wanted
his
own
commonwealth
to
permit
the
formation
of
a
separate
kentucky
and
at
this
time
he
urged
a
further
cession
of
territory
amounting
to
somewhat
more
than
the
present
state
of
that
name
he
believed
that
virginia
should
draw
her
boundary
at
the
meridian
of
the
mouth
of
the
great
kanawha
that
is
its
junction
with
the
ohio
further
she
cannot
govern
he
wrote
george
washington
so
far
is
necessary
for
her
own
well
being
in
his
first
bill
this
far
seeing
man
drew
boundaries
for
fourteen
new
states
even
though
there
were
only
thirteen
in
the
original
union
and
he
gave
names
to
ten
he
followed
his
penchant
for
mathematical
exactitude
by
arranging
these
in
tiers
the
whole
plan
was
ingeniously
logical
too
logical
if
anything
for
this
regular
geometrical
pattern
is
not
pleasing
to
the
eye
it
was
never
put
into
effect
but
the
present
map
of
the
american
west
suggests
that
it
was
influential
in
general
he
translated
indian
names
or
geographical
features
into
classical
form
but
his
list
was
not
liked
then
and
has
often
been
ridiculed
since
that
time
cherronesus
assenisipia
and
pelisipia
were
well
lost
no
metropotamia
or
polypotamia
came
into
existence
but
there
is
a
michigan
for
his
michigania
and
for
his
illinoia
there
is
illinois
of
his
historical
names
saratoga
might
well
have
been
preserved
as
washington
was
all
the
names
disappeared
from
his
second
report
though
they
may
still
be
seen
on
old
maps
and
in
it
was
decided
that
his
boundaries
were
too
small
the
specific
provisions
for
government
were
not
to
become
effective
until
after
the
lands
had
been
purchased
from
the
indians
and
offered
for
sale
and
actually
they
were
superseded
by
the
provisions
of
the
ordinance
of
they
were
chiefly
significant
in
allowing
for
successive
stages
of
government
and
for
self
government
at
every
stage
the
most
striking
feature
of
the
report
was
the
statement
of
the
principles
upon
which
both
the
temporary
and
permanent
political
structures
of
these
states
were
to
be
based
that
they
should
be
subject
to
congress
and
the
articles
of
confederation
like
their
elder
sisters
that
they
should
be
responsible
for
their
share
of
the
public
debt
that
the
various
governments
should
be
republican
in
form
these
requirements
might
have
been
expected
in
any
proposal
of
this
sort
much
more
notable
were
the
provisions
that
they
should
remain
forever
a
part
of
the
united
states
that
they
should
admit
to
citizenship
no
person
holding
a
hereditary
title
and
that
slavery
should
not
exist
among
them
after
since
these
provisions
applied
to
the
territory
ceded
and
to
be
ceded
that
is
to
the
region
south
as
well
as
north
of
the
ohio
jefferson
s
ordinance
was
designed
to
prevent
the
spread
of
slavery
as
a
legal
institution
outside
of
the
original
states
and
it
would
have
made
secession
impracticable
if
not
impossible
only
in
the
light
of
tragic
history
can
the
wisdom
of
his
preventive
measure
be
fully
appreciated
but
congress
struck
out
the
clauses
prohibiting
slavery
and
hereditary
titles
jefferson
reported
that
the
former
was
lost
accidentally
by
a
single
vote
and
believed
that
the
latter
was
dropped
because
the
prohibition
was
regarded
as
unnecessary
in
that
particular
region
he
was
quite
sure
that
sentiment
in
congress
was
against
hereditary
titles
because
he
had
perceived
strong
dislike
there
for
the
military
society
of
the
cincinnati
which
had
been
initiated
the
year
before
and
was
then
designed
to
be
hereditary
there
is
no
better
illustration
of
his
own
attitude
than
the
contemporary
judgment
he
passed
on
the
society
he
himself
was
not
eligible
to
this
organization
of
veterans
and
the
original
list
of
members
contained
no
close
friend
of
his
except
monroe
opposition
to
it
was
greatest
among
men
who
had
remained
civilians
in
the
war
and
of
these
opponents
jefferson
has
generally
been
regarded
as
the
strongest
and
most
persistent
his
reasons
were
not
those
of
personal
pique
however
as
george
washington
had
good
reason
to
know
the
general
was
president
pro
tem
and
sensing
the
opposition
he
asked
jefferson
s
opinion
of
the
organization
about
this
time
the
former
governor
was
temperate
and
judicious
in
his
reply
but
he
left
no
doubt
that
he
disliked
and
feared
the
society
and
would
have
preferred
that
washington
not
lend
his
great
prestige
to
it
also
in
calmly
stating
the
objections
that
were
most
frequently
voiced
against
it
he
not
only
gave
a
classic
statement
of
the
civilians
case
against
the
military
he
showed
at
the
same
time
the
social
convictions
which
dominated
his
own
mind
he
was
still
in
the
mood
of
the
declaration
of
independence
after
all
these
years
of
war
and
he
now
realized
even
more
fully
the
implications
of
his
own
famous
words
the
deepest
objection
to
the
society
of
the
cincinnati
was
that
it
was
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
american
political
institutions
for
the
foundation
on
which
these
were
built
was
the
natural
equality
of
man
the
denial
of
every
preeminence
but
that
annexed
to
legal
office
and
particularly
the
denial
of
a
preeminence
by
birth
the
danger
of
oppression
by
hereditary
groups
in
america
he
believed
to
be
still
remote
but
only
the
moderation
of
washington
probably
had
prevented
this
revolution
from
closing
like
most
others
in
a
subversion
of
that
liberty
it
was
intended
to
establish
he
had
found
that
the
organization
was
opposed
with
an
anguish
of
mind
such
as
he
had
never
observed
before
and
was
certain
it
would
never
be
approved
by
congress
it
could
be
made
unobjectionable
only
if
modified
almost
to
the
point
of
annihilation
it
never
was
rendered
unobjectionable
to
him
but
washington
stopped
by
annapolis
on
his
way
to
the
general
meeting
of
the
society
in
new
york
in
may
and
discussed
the
matter
with
him
by
the
light
of
candles
until
after
midnight
furthermore
the
modifications
which
the
president
soon
recommended
including
the
abolition
of
the
hereditary
provision
showed
the
clear
mark
of
this
counselor
s
ideas
jefferson
s
own
deep
respect
for
washington
had
not
wavered
and
he
retained
the
conviction
that
the
general
would
have
dropped
the
organization
altogether
if
circumstances
had
not
forced
him
to
accept
it
in
modified
form
at
this
stage
jefferson
viewed
it
as
no
partisan
he
wrote
the
general
i
consider
the
whole
matter
as
between
ourselves
alone
having
determined
to
take
no
active
part
in
this
or
anything
else
which
may
lead
to
altercation
or
disturb
that
quiet
and
tranquility
of
mind
to
which
i
consign
the
remaining
portion
of
my
life
he
was
firm
in
his
political
faith
he
was
outdoing
himself
in
the
effort
to
be
constructive
and
he
far
outstripped
his
congressional
fellows
in
the
daring
of
his
mind
but
his
aversion
to
public
controversy
had
in
no
way
diminished
as
the
quarrelsome
session
wore
on
he
made
no
public
fuss
about
the
changes
congress
made
in
his
ordinance
but
it
is
likely
that
he
was
more
disappointed
than
he
admitted
the
unamended
report
got
into
one
of
the
philadelphia
papers
and
in
a
letter
to
francis
hopkinson
which
he
tried
to
make
humorous
he
termed
this
a
forgery
beneath
his
irony
resentment
may
be
detected
the
exclusion
of
hereditary
titles
and
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
west
were
not
within
the
level
of
congressional
politics
he
said
the
delegates
had
no
sympathy
with
such
pettyfogging
ideas
and
he
himself
was
regarded
as
a
daring
innovator
but
behind
the
scenes
he
won
something
of
a
victory
over
hereditary
titles
and
sentiment
afterwards
shifted
in
his
direction
with
respect
to
slavery
in
the
ordinance
of
slavery
was
prohibited
though
only
in
the
region
northwest
of
the
ohio
credit
for
this
historic
action
has
been
much
disputed
but
the
date
and
scope
of
jefferson
s
proposal
are
open
to
no
question
and
its
later
influence
may
be
presumed
he
himself
laid
little
stress
on
it
afterwards
and
his
state
of
mind
in
was
certainly
not
one
of
self
gratulation
he
was
operating
in
an
atmosphere
of
legislative
futility
and
nothing
was
adopted
as
he
proposed
it
his
lengthy
report
on
the
mode
of
locating
and
disposing
of
western
lands
a
companion
piece
to
the
ordinance
on
government
was
not
debated
until
after
he
had
left
congress
his
proposals
were
not
accepted
and
if
he
influenced
later
action
on
this
question
he
did
so
chiefly
by
advocating
orderly
survey
in
advance
of
sales
he
advocated
the
geometrical
mile
subdivided
into
furlongs
chains
and
paces
on
the
decimal
principle
he
was
more
successful
in
his
attempt
to
decimalize
the
coinage
this
was
not
the
first
time
he
concerned
himself
with
the
disorderly
monetary
situation
in
he
drafted
a
report
on
the
value
of
the
various
gold
and
silver
coins
current
in
the
states
though
this
was
left
lying
on
the
table
the
question
of
coinage
came
up
again
before
he
returned
to
congress
and
robert
morris
the
superintendent
of
finance
made
a
report
jefferson
could
not
get
hold
of
this
but
he
did
see
a
sketch
of
the
financier
s
plan
and
he
submitted
to
morris
the
notes
which
he
himself
threw
together
he
had
no
hope
of
action
at
this
session
but
he
wanted
his
recommendations
to
be
available
at
the
next
meeting
and
he
had
a
sufficiently
good
opinion
of
them
to
print
them
later
on
with
explanations
which
he
added
after
he
heard
from
morris
jefferson
s
notes
on
the
establishment
of
a
money
unit
and
of
a
coinage
for
the
united
states
proved
exceedingly
influential
and
despite
the
technicality
of
the
subject
they
make
highly
interesting
reading
the
unit
proposed
by
him
was
the
spanish
silver
dollar
which
was
already
in
wide
use
and
of
a
convenient
size
morris
had
proposed
a
unit
which
was
the
largest
common
divisor
of
the
penny
of
every
state
and
was
calculated
as
the
th
part
of
a
dollar
jefferson
regarded
this
as
too
minute
for
practical
affairs
he
saw
no
use
in
valuing
a
horse
worth
dollars
at
units
morris
later
agreed
with
him
on
this
point
and
recommended
a
new
unit
which
would
have
the
value
of
of
the
first
units
and
of
a
dollar
but
jefferson
thought
the
familiar
dollar
much
to
be
preferred
the
exact
relation
between
this
and
gold
he
regarded
as
a
technical
question
and
he
pressed
no
precise
ratio
he
did
insist
on
the
subdivision
of
the
dollar
on
the
basis
of
tenths
and
hundredths
morris
himself
had
proposed
that
the
coins
be
in
decimal
proportion
to
one
another
but
jefferson
made
the
argument
overwhelming
the
bulk
of
mankind
are
school
boys
through
life
he
said
the
perplexities
of
money
arithmetic
are
always
great
to
most
people
he
observed
and
even
mathematical
heads
welcome
the
relief
of
a
simpler
process
certainly
in
all
cases
where
we
are
free
to
choose
between
easy
and
difficult
modes
of
operation
he
continued
it
is
most
rational
to
choose
the
easy
he
wanted
to
get
rid
of
pounds
shillings
pence
and
farthings
and
at
a
later
time
he
made
vigorous
efforts
to
extend
the
decimal
idea
to
weights
and
measures
generally
he
fully
realized
the
tyranny
of
habit
over
the
human
mind
however
and
sought
to
systematize
the
coinage
in
the
most
practicable
way
thus
he
not
only
recommended
the
adoption
of
the
familiar
dollar
he
also
proposed
that
the
subdivisions
would
coincide
as
nearly
as
possible
with
other
well
known
coins
the
tenth
dime
which
he
recommended
was
comparable
with
the
spanish
bit
the
double
tenth
was
like
the
spanish
pistareen
and
the
hundredth
would
be
nearly
enough
like
existing
coppers
there
was
no
close
companion
to
the
half
dollar
but
the
gold
eagle
ten
dollars
was
near
enough
to
the
half
joe
and
the
double
guinea
to
be
quickly
estimated
anyone
desiring
information
about
the
coins
in
circulation
at
that
time
or
about
the
value
of
the
pound
in
the
various
states
will
find
plenty
of
details
in
the
notes
of
this
extraordinarily
observant
man
in
the
end
congress
accepted
the
decimal
system
of
coinage
without
dispute
adopted
the
dollar
instead
of
morris
s
proposed
new
unit
and
accepted
most
of
jefferson
s
suggestions
about
other
coins
the
main
difference
between
his
proposals
and
those
of
morris
lay
in
their
more
immediate
practicability
here
he
showed
himself
to
be
not
merely
a
prophetic
statesman
but
also
in
the
best
sense
of
the
term
an
opportunist
there
was
little
or
nothing
of
importance
in
congress
that
he
did
not
concern
himself
with
for
example
he
reported
on
the
arrears
of
interest
on
the
national
debt
and
made
proposals
for
current
financial
operations
he
was
no
ignoramus
on
that
subject
when
he
confronted
alexander
hamilton
at
a
later
time
nor
did
he
need
any
reminders
from
his
historic
rival
about
the
desirability
of
preserving
the
union
and
giving
it
visible
reality
no
one
was
more
concerned
than
he
except
possibly
secretary
charles
thomson
lest
the
government
go
by
default
during
the
inevitable
recess
of
congress
and
he
was
the
moving
force
in
setting
up
a
committee
of
states
to
preserve
a
visible
head
when
the
delegates
had
scurried
home
as
they
threatened
to
do
at
any
time
early
in
the
session
he
drafted
a
report
defining
in
detail
the
powers
to
be
exercised
and
this
proving
too
elaborate
he
presented
a
briefer
one
at
the
end
of
january
the
powers
of
this
interim
committee
were
necessarily
slight
and
following
the
articles
of
confederation
the
vote
of
nine
members
was
required
for
any
action
beyond
adjournment
the
committee
of
states
was
a
weak
instrument
but
there
was
doubt
in
many
minds
whether
there
should
be
any
instrument
at
all
it
was
not
created
until
after
jefferson
had
left
and
unhappily
it
amounted
to
nothing
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
his
colleague
samuel
hardy
its
chairman
the
representatives
of
nine
states
could
not
be
kept
together
and
there
was
much
quarreling
among
those
who
did
attend
charles
thomson
wrote
to
jefferson
in
france
that
he
feared
the
invisibility
of
a
federal
head
would
have
bad
effects
in
europe
franklin
after
hearing
of
the
bickering
told
jefferson
a
story
of
factionalism
in
a
lighthouse
in
the
english
channel
which
was
wholly
inaccessible
in
winter
the
two
keepers
quarreled
in
the
fall
divided
into
two
parties
one
above
and
one
below
and
did
not
speak
till
spring
it
was
by
joining
the
inimitable
franklin
that
jefferson
escaped
the
petty
squabbles
of
the
representatives
of
the
american
states
the
change
in
his
prospects
came
suddenly
when
on
may
he
was
elected
minister
plenipotentiary
to
share
in
the
negotiation
of
treaties
of
amity
and
commerce
with
european
nations
congress
had
been
talking
about
this
subject
from
the
beginning
of
the
session
as
long
ago
as
december
jefferson
had
presented
a
report
on
instructions
to
the
ministers
and
this
formed
the
basis
for
the
instructions
which
were
adopted
on
the
day
of
his
own
appointment
john
adams
benjamin
franklin
and
john
jay
were
already
in
europe
and
the
southern
delegates
had
been
clamoring
for
the
addition
to
the
commission
of
two
ministers
who
were
familiar
with
the
commercial
needs
of
their
part
of
the
country
congress
had
balked
at
this
but
was
disposed
to
add
one
minister
and
it
was
generally
expected
that
this
would
be
the
delegate
who
had
taken
the
lead
in
matters
relating
to
the
peace
treaty
and
foreign
affairs
the
whole
situation
was
cleared
by
the
news
that
john
jay
was
coming
home
congress
immediately
elected
him
to
the
long
vacant
office
of
secretary
of
foreign
affairs
chose
jefferson
to
replace
him
in
europe
and
adopted
the
instructions
unanimity
prevailed
in
congress
and
everybody
was
pleased
a
delegate
from
new
england
described
jefferson
as
a
sensible
judicious
man
and
the
virginians
reflecting
on
the
benefits
of
his
appointment
to
the
union
regarded
themselves
as
compensated
for
the
loss
of
a
very
able
and
amiable
colleague
monroe
who
was
going
to
miss
him
most
of
all
summed
things
up
by
saying
that
foreign
affairs
were
now
on
as
excellent
a
basis
as
anyone
could
desire
not
all
of
the
virginia
leaders
at
home
were
pleased
however
and
john
tyler
was
one
who
voiced
regrets
his
comments
are
the
more
pertinent
because
they
show
just
what
sort
of
public
servant
jefferson
was
thought
to
be
if
it
is
your
wish
to
go
abroad
wrote
tyler
to
be
sure
mine
would
be
to
gratify
you
but
i
know
it
will
be
hard
to
supply
your
place
for
those
gentlemen
whose
abilities
are
not
despisable
are
either
too
sick
and
indolent
to
make
any
sacrifice
for
the
public
or
too
poor
to
give
up
better
prospects
for
supporting
their
families
god
send
you
safe
to
the
destined
port
continue
you
there
in
health
and
happiness
as
long
as
you
choose
to
stay
and
waft
you
back
to
your
native
country
where
you
will
always
be
acceptable
to
the
good
and
virtuous
the
references
to
jefferson
s
character
and
his
disinterested
patriotism
were
typical
nobody
thought
of
him
as
one
who
had
a
political
ax
to
grind
or
was
in
any
sense
a
troublemaker
since
your
departure
we
have
done
nothing
wrote
samuel
hardy
afterwards
congress
have
been
involved
in
a
scene
of
confusion
greater
than
you
can
conceive
there
would
have
been
confusion
had
he
remained
there
but
those
who
knew
him
well
realized
that
he
lived
on
a
higher
plane
the
best
description
of
him
at
this
time
came
from
no
colleague
but
from
the
young
dutchman
hogendorp
who
had
such
a
low
opinion
of
congress
in
general
on
his
visit
to
annapolis
he
had
fallen
quite
in
love
with
jefferson
i
very
soon
observed
that
your
conversation
bent
on
serious
objects
could
be
more
useful
to
me
than
that
of
any
gentlemen
in
town
i
had
met
with
he
sad
your
making
no
hyperfluous
compliments
your
retired
life
made
you
appear
a
man
of
business
even
your
cool
and
reserved
behaviour
prepossessed
me
in
favour
of
you
with
your
writing
a
manuscript
copy
of
the
notes
on
virginia
i
went
on
solitary
walks
in
the
wood
that
looks
so
beautiful
from
the
little
meadow
behind
your
house
at
the
same
time
i
became
acquainted
with
your
state
and
with
yourself
i
grew
fond
of
your
benevolent
character
as
much
as
i
admired
your
extensive
learning
your
strength
of
judgment
i
pitied
your
situation
for
i
thought
you
unhappy
why
i
did
not
know
and
though
you
appeared
insensible
to
social
enjoyments
yet
i
was
perfectly
convinced
you
could
not
have
been
ever
so
one
evening
i
talked
of
love
and
then
i
perceived
that
you
still
could
feel
and
express
your
feelings
jefferson
introduced
this
newly
embraced
friend
to
washington
as
the
best
informed
man
of
his
age
that
he
had
ever
seen
he
had
no
liking
for
bickering
politicians
but
he
loved
young
men
who
were
full
of
enthusiasm
information
and
ideas
and
throughout
life
he
exerted
on
them
an
irresistible
appeal
in
another
letter
this
one
said
the
esteem
of
a
man
of
your
character
is
a
great
reward
of
my
endeavors
to
deserve
it
but
his
affection
makes
me
happy
after
his
signature
he
wrote
these
words
k
means
karel
that
is
charles
which
signature
if
you
will
accept
of
i
shall
employ
in
the
future
he
had
occasion
to
employ
it
again
in
later
months
the
new
minister
did
not
have
time
to
return
to
virginia
to
see
his
two
little
children
picking
up
patsy
in
philadelphia
jefferson
set
out
for
new
york
and
after
six
days
went
on
to
boston
he
carried
with
him
the
manuscript
of
his
notes
on
virginia
having
been
disappointed
in
his
hope
of
getting
them
printed
inexpensively
in
philadelphia
he
also
bore
more
than
a
score
of
commissions
authorizing
him
adams
and
franklin
to
negotiate
treaties
with
as
many
countries
since
he
was
to
deal
mainly
with
questions
of
commerce
he
wisely
sought
to
familiarize
himself
with
the
commercial
needs
of
the
different
localities
as
he
proceeded
through
the
successive
seaport
towns
he
expected
to
be
far
more
than
a
representative
of
southern
interests
and
he
made
a
special
point
of
acquainting
himself
with
the
needs
of
new
england
which
he
had
never
visited
before
he
was
treated
with
the
utmost
cordiality
leaving
providence
he
was
attended
for
a
few
miles
by
some
of
the
principal
inhabitants
and
soon
after
he
arrived
in
boston
the
general
court
of
massachusetts
ordered
that
a
chair
be
assigned
him
if
he
was
disposed
to
attend
the
meetings
of
the
house
also
a
special
committee
was
appointed
to
confer
with
him
and
give
him
useful
information
about
the
state
his
time
was
not
wholly
given
to
business
however
much
of
it
was
occupied
with
the
hospitalities
and
civilities
of
boston
which
he
experienced
in
the
highest
degree
his
hospitable
reception
was
partly
owing
to
letters
of
introduction
given
him
by
his
recent
congressional
colleague
elbridge
gerry
and
before
sailing
he
left
as
a
present
for
gerry
what
the
latter
described
as
an
elegant
travelling
desk
he
went
as
far
north
as
portsmouth
new
hampshire
and
patsy
congratulated
herself
on
having
seen
so
many
states
her
father
s
score
was
identical
he
had
missed
only
georgia
and
the
two
carolinas
of
the
thirteen
jefferson
did
not
regard
himself
as
merely
a
commissioner
of
commerce
and
was
not
so
regarded
by
others
roger
sherman
delegate
to
congress
from
connecticut
had
given
him
a
letter
to
president
ezra
stiles
of
yale
describing
him
as
a
gentleman
of
much
philosophical
as
well
as
political
knowledge
and
predicting
that
his
conversation
would
prove
entertaining
so
it
did
he
told
the
president
of
yale
about
a
new
piece
of
electrical
apparatus
and
about
the
great
bones
that
had
been
dug
up
on
the
ohio
these
marvels
suffering
no
diminution
in
the
telling
he
saw
the
library
and
apparatus
of
the
college
talked
about
the
state
of
academic
affairs
at
william
and
mary
and
impressed
his
host
as
a
truly
scientific
and
learned
man
excellent
in
every
way
it
is
not
surprising
that
he
and
stiles
afterwards
exchanged
long
philosophical
letters
and
that
a
couple
of
years
later
he
was
awarded
the
degree
of
ll
d
by
yale
this
honor
anticipated
by
two
years
a
similar
one
from
harvard
but
he
already
had
the
degree
of
d
c
l
from
william
and
mary
unlike
franklin
he
was
rarely
referred
to
by
academic
title
but
dr
jefferson
was
recognized
in
new
england
no
less
than
in
virginia
or
philadelphia
as
a
leading
literary
and
scientific
light
he
arranged
with
others
besides
ezra
stiles
to
communicate
with
him
about
the
wonders
of
natural
history
one
of
these
correspondents
general
john
sullivan
of
new
hampshire
writing
him
further
about
the
moose
expressed
a
hope
which
was
in
many
minds
that
his
success
in
his
new
endeavor
might
equal
the
zeal
he
had
always
shown
in
the
cause
of
his
country
jefferson
himself
was
using
the
latter
term
in
its
more
provincial
sense
when
on
relinquishing
his
seat
in
congress
he
wrote
to
the
assembly
of
his
own
commonwealth
i
have
made
the
just
rights
of
my
country
and
the
cement
of
that
union
in
which
her
happiness
and
security
is
bound
up
the
leading
objects
of
my
conduct
the
statement
was
correct
he
had
been
a
good
virginian
and
a
consistent
unionist
throughout
his
public
life
he
made
a
further
observation
in
a
final
letter
to
madison
i
find
the
conviction
growing
strongly
that
nothing
can
preserve
our
confederacy
unless
the
band
of
union
their
common
council
is
strengthened
this
serious
and
highly
cultivated
gentleman
who
was
so
averse
to
controversy
continued
to
view
the
young
republic
as
a
whole
and
to
advocate
the
strengthening
of
the
feeble
union
but
actually
he
left
his
worst
fears
of
disunion
and
disorder
behind
him
when
he
sailed
from
boston
on
the
good
ship
ceres
on
july
at
a
m
the
contrast
which
impressed
him
first
and
most
in
the
old
world
was
not
between
european
order
and
american
anarchy
but
between
ancient
tyrannies
and
the
political
liberties
which
his
countrymen
so
generally
enjoyed
he
remained
more
than
five
years
on
the
vaunted
scene
of
europe
witnessed
without
alarm
the
beginnings
of
a
revolution
that
shook
the
world
and
returned
home
to
be
embroiled
in
more
bitter
wrangles
than
he
had
ever
known
before
but
he
did
not
anticipate
this
when
he
embarked
on
the
ceres
with
his
daughter
and
sailed
pleasantly
across
calm
seas
he
was
only
forty
one
years
old
but
a
distinguished
career
of
patriotic
service
and
personal
achievement
already
lay
behind
him
and
he
thought
this
almost
if
not
quite
enough
he
expected
more
quiet
and
greater
richness
in
the
new
phase
which
had
begun
