MALAYALAM SEGMENTATION ANALYSIS - DETAILED RESULTS
======================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------
  ✓ Models successfully distinguish between Malayalam script types
  ✓ Malayalam native model shows good word boundary understanding
  ✓ Transliterated model shows good word boundary understanding
  • Malayalam native script compresses better than transliterated

DETAILED ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------

1. WORD BOUNDARY UNDERSTANDING:
   (Models that compress 'original' better than 'no spaces' understand word boundaries)

   Malayalam Native With Own Model:
     Status: ✓ GOOD
     BPC Difference: 0.215

   Malayalam Transliterated With Own Model:
     Status: ✓ GOOD
     BPC Difference: 0.883

   Malayalam Native With Malayalam Transliterated Model:
     Status: ✗ POOR
     BPC Difference: 0.029

   Malayalam Transliterated With Malayalam Native Model:
     Status: ✓ GOOD
     BPC Difference: 0.713

2. CROSS-MODEL PERFORMANCE:

   Malayalam native text prefers native model: True
   Transliterated text prefers trans model: True
   Models distinguish correctly: True

3. COMPRESSION PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:

   Best compression: malayalam native with own model
   Bits per character: 1.31

4. SPECIFIC METRICS:

   MALAYALAM NATIVE WITH OWN MODEL:
     Original spacing: 1.310 BPC
     No spaces: 1.525 BPC
     Compression ratio: 6.11x

   MALAYALAM TRANSLITERATED WITH OWN MODEL:
     Original spacing: 1.477 BPC
     No spaces: 2.360 BPC
     Compression ratio: 5.42x

   MALAYALAM NATIVE WITH MALAYALAM TRANSLITERATED MODEL:
     Original spacing: 7.620 BPC
     No spaces: 7.649 BPC
     Compression ratio: 1.05x

   MALAYALAM TRANSLITERATED WITH MALAYALAM NATIVE MODEL:
     Original spacing: 15.681 BPC
     No spaces: 16.394 BPC
     Compression ratio: 0.51x

5. DISSERTATION INSIGHTS:

   • Malayalam script and transliteration have distinct compression signatures
   • PPM models learn orthography-specific word boundary patterns
   • Cross-model testing reveals script-specific statistical structures
   • Compression-based analysis provides quantitative evidence of linguistic differences

6. QUANTITATIVE EVIDENCE:

   Native model advantage for Malayalam text: 6.310 BPC improvement
   Transliterated model advantage: 14.204 BPC improvement
   Total distinguishability: 20.514 BPC
